Exploring Background Aperiodic Electroencephalography (EEG) Activity in the Bucharest Early Intervention Project	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Aperiodic activity is a background arrhythmic component of electroencephalogram (EEG) that is present in the power spectrum and characterized by an aperiodic offset and an aperiodic exponent. These components have been proposed as a marker of brain maturation, reflecting alterations in excitatory-inhibitory (E:I) balance and exhibiting developmental changes over time. Currently, there is limited understanding regarding how aperiodic activity changes over the course of an individual's life, particularly from early childhood to adolescence, a period when the brain undergoes significant structural and functional transformation. More importantly, considering that brain development is affected by early experience, there is no evidence on how early adversity might affect these parameters. Here, we examined the developmental trajectories of aperiodic activity from EEG data collected in the Bucharest Early Intervention Project, from early childhood to mid adolescence (from 42 months of age up to 16 years old). We examined the effects of a history of early adversity and the impact of early intervention on background aperiodic EEG activity. Surprisingly, we found little influence of a history of adversity or early intervention on these characteristics of the signal. Rather, we found nonlinear age-related trajectories in both aperiodic offset and aperiodic exponent and sex differences in the trajectory for aperiodic offset (but not exponent). These findings provide information on the maturational patterns and trajectories of brain development from early childhood to mid adolescence and how background aperiodic activity describes one aspect of EEG development.

The present study investigated the influence of model familiarity on this behavior-known as "overimitation"-with a two-phase overimitation task. We tested whether 5-year-old Austrian children (N = 52, 28 males) would overimitate their parents more than a stranger when operating a novel puzzle box. First, an inefficient strategy was demonstrated by a parent (or stranger) before the child's first turn on the box; then, an efficient strategy was demonstrated by a stranger (or parent) before the child's second turn. Results showed that children who first saw their parent's inefficient strategy overimitated it slightly more than those who saw the stranger's. After the efficient demonstration, we observed a reduction in children's overimitation of their parent's (but not the stranger's) inefficient strategy. Comparisons to a no-model (baseline) condition revealed significantly higher overimitation scores for our parent-then-stranger and stranger-then-parent conditions in the first phase, but only for the stranger-then-parent condition in the second phase. We also observed children protesting against their parents' efficient demonstration (in favor of the stranger's inefficient demonstration). These results suggest (a) that overimitation can occur in two ways (supporting a dual-process theory) and (b) that children selectively overimitate depending on model familiarity.

Spatial navigation undergoes profound maturational changes during childhood. It is unclear how well children can consolidate navigation-based spatial memories and if age-related variations in navigation during training predict spatial memory. The present study examined the immediate and long-delay (after a 2-week period) consolidation of navigation-based spatial memories in 6- to 8-year-old children (n = 33, 18 female/15 male, M-age = 7.61, SDage = 0.71), 9- to 11-year-old children (n = 32, 13 female/19 male, M-age = 9.90, SDage = 0.59), and 20- to 30-year-old adults (n = 31, 15 female/16 male, M-age = 23.71, SDage = 2.87). Our results showed that, with age, participants navigated more efficiently during training and formed better immediate spatial memories. Long-delay spatial memory retention after 2 weeks was comparable between children and adults, indicating robust consolidation even in children. Interestingly, while children successfully distinguished between perceptually detailed landmarks after 2 weeks, their abstract knowledge of spatial boundaries and cognitive map of landmark relations was poor. Developmental trajectories were similar for egocentric and allocentric spatial memory. Age-related variations in initial navigation were predictive of spatial memory, that is, children with a more mature initial navigation were more likely to find and remember spatial locations immediately and after a 2-week delay. Taken together, our results show an overall robust spatial memory consolidation in mid and late childhood that can be predicted by initial navigation behavior, coupled with nuanced age differences in the recall of spatial boundaries and cognitive maps.					; Finke, Carsten/H-6479-2017	Shing, Yee Lee/0000-0001-8922-7292; Iggena, Deetje/0000-0001-8778-5127; Ploner, Christoph Johannes/0000-0003-0983-4530; Schommartz, Iryna/0000-0001-8655-9259; Finke, Carsten/0000-0002-7665-1171													0012-1649	1939-0599				2024 SEP 5	2024										10.1037/dev0001799	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001799		SEP 2024						39235881					WOS:001305897800001

Despite evidence from studies with adults that aha experiences benefit learning, little systematic research on children's aha experiences exists. The present study asks how children understand and experience insight. We presented a community sample of 160 children (age: 4-8 years, 47% girls, 51% boys, 2% nonbinary) with an illustrated clues task inspired by the Remote Associate Test, a task commonly used to study insight in adults. In this task, children saw three clues and were asked to find a solution word that was associated with the three clues. Self-reported and observed aha experiences were recorded, along with children's solution accuracy and confidence. Children also answered a set of questions to assess their understanding of aha experiences. We found that although the number of aha experiences remained stable across age, there was a clear developmental increase in the understanding of aha experiences. Children's ability to recognize their own aha experiences as well as their general understanding of the aha concept increased with age. This suggests a lag between the occurrence of children's aha experiences and their understanding of such experiences; children first have aha experiences and later develop an understanding of those experiences. Aha experiences were associated with higher accuracy, but not with higher confidence ratings. Observed aha experiences, but not self-reported aha experiences, predicted increased motivation. Our findings are in line with the literature on metacognitive development and the distinction between the experience and the understanding of emotion.

J	Marceau, K; Conradt, E; Roubinov, D				Marceau, Kristine; Conradt, Elisabeth; Roubinov, Danielle			Prenatal Influences Across the Life Course: Biobehavioral Mechanisms of Development	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Despite the well-established importance of prenatal experiences for offspring health throughout the lifespan, our understanding of prenatal influences on psychological outcomes faces challenges due to a wide-ranging and somewhat fragmented literature. Here, we introduce the special issue of Developmental Psychology, "Prenatal Influences Across the Life Course: Biobehavioral Mechanisms of Development," which draws together a broad collection of 12 empirical studies and one review article. These studies illustrate the diversity in biobehavioral mechanisms and biopsychosocial processes that help explain the long-term impacts of prenatal experiences on human development. Collectively, these studies help to disentangle sources of influence across different life stages (e.g., prenatal from genetic, preconception, and/or postnatal influences) and fill key gaps in the literature, such as the inclusion of minoritized populations currently underrepresented in research, the role of fathers, and protective mechanisms. The research featured in this special issue underscores both the long reach of prenatal influences on child and adolescent development as well as the challenges in observing specific biological mediators given that prenatal risks are currently operationalized as specific or broad cumulative measures. In an effort to organize this complex literature, we propose a guiding framework for how to conceptualize the continued integration of the prenatal environment into the field of developmental psychology. This framework broadens the prevailing dichotomous view of prenatal mechanisms as cumulative or specific to articulate a dimensional approach focused on adaptation. We anticipate that such an approach may uncover meaningful and observable biobehavioral mechanisms of prenatal influence on offspring development in the future.

The Effects of Illicit Drug Use During Pregnancy and Parental Hostility on Problem Behaviors in School-Aged Children Over and Above Genetic Influences	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Previous work has examined the impact of prenatal illicit drug use (PDU) on children's problem behaviors. However, many PDU-related risk factors, including genetic and rearing environmental risks, can also influence offspring's problem behaviors, thus confounding PDU, genetic, and rearing environmental influences. This study aimed to (a) identify effects of PDU on school-aged children's problem behaviors, including both externalizing and internalizing behaviors at Age 7, after controlling genetic and specific rearing environmental (e.g., maternal and paternal hostility at Ages 4.5 and 6) influences and (b) examine interaction effects between PDU and maternal and paternal hostility in predicting children's problem behaviors at Age 7. We used a parent-offspring adoption design to partition genetic and prenatal effects from postnatal rearing environmental influences. Participants were 561 children adopted at birth (42% female; 56% White, 19% multiracial, 13% Black/African American, 11% Latine, and 1% other), their adoptive parents, and their birth parents. Results indicate that PDU did not show a direct impact on Age 7 problem behaviors before or after controlling genetic risks and adoptive mother's and father's hostility. However, we found significant interactions between adoptive father's hostility and PDU when predicting children's problem behaviors, such that higher paternal hostility was associated with higher externalizing and internalizing behaviors for children whose birth mothers were non-use or rare use of illicit drugs during pregnancy. The results suggest that different from non- or rare drug-exposed children, higher levels of PDU may override the effects of paternal hostility, but not maternal hostility, on problem behaviors at Age 7.

Biological and Social Cascades of Prenatal Contextual Risk and Maternal Psychological Distress to Early-Childhood Adjustment	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												In the peripartum, putative mechanisms in the transmission of prenatal contextual risk and maternal psychological distress include biological and social processes. In this study, path analyses were used to test unique, cascading pathways of prenatal contextual risk and pre- and postnatal maternal psychological distress through social mediators (parenting) and biological mediators (infant stress physiology) on infant temperament and toddler adjustment. The sample is comprised of racially and ethnically diverse first-time mothers (N = 200) living in low-income contexts (<200% poverty) who were followed from pregnancy to 18-36 months postpartum. In pregnancy, mothers reported contextual risk and psychological distress (anxiety, depression). In the postpartum, mothers reported their psychological distress. At 2-4 months postpartum, observed mother-infant interactions were coded for sensitive responsiveness. Infant cortisol baseline and reactivity to a lab stressor were collected when infants were 4-6 months old. Mothers reported on infant's temperament (negative affect, effortful control) at 10-12 months and on child adjustment (internalizing, externalizing symptoms) at 18-36 months. Prenatal contextual risk predicted infant cortisol reactivity. Prenatal psychological distress predicted postnatal distress but, when accounting for postnatal distress, did not predict putative mediators or indicators of child adjustment. In contrast, maternal postnatal depression predicted subsequent maternal sensitive responsiveness, which in turn predicted later infant baseline cortisol and cortisol reactivity. Baseline cortisol predicted infant negative affectivity, which predicted toddler internalizing and externalizing symptoms. There was no evidence of mediated effects of prenatal variables on child adjustment outcomes, whereas contextual risk, postnatal psychological distress, and parenting were more salient predictors of child adjustment. Public Significance Statement Children growing up in low-income contexts are more likely to have adjustment problems compared with advantaged peers. The mechanisms of this are not well-understood. This study tests potential contributors to children's adjustment outcomes from pregnancy to toddlerhood, finding that for families living in the context of low income, contextual risk factors, a mother's mental health after giving birth, a child's stress physiology, and parenting behaviors all contribute to children's adjustment.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				SEP	2024	60	9			SI		1593	1605		10.1037/dev0001759	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001759								38976424					WOS:001324665800010

Maternal Smoking During Pregnancy Is Associated With DNA Methylation in Early Adolescence: A Sibling Comparison Design	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Maternal smoking during pregnancy (MSDP) may impact offspring biological (e.g., deoxyribonucleic acid methylation [DNAm]) and behavioral (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder hyperactive/impulsive [ADHD-HI] symptoms) development. There has been consistency in findings of differential methylation in global DNAm, and the specific genes AHRR, CYP1A1, CNTNAP2, MYO1G, and GFI1 in relation to MSDP. The current study aims to (a) replicate the associations of MSDP and DNAm in prior literature in middle childhood-adolescence (cross-sectionally) using a sibling-comparison design where siblings were discordant for MSDP (n = 328 families; M-age Sibling 1 = 13.02; Sibling 2 = 10.20), adjusting for prenatal and postnatal covariates in order to isolate the MSDP exposure on DNAm. We also (b) cross-sectionally explored the role of DNAm in the most robust MSDP-ADHD associations (i.e., with ADHD-HI) previously found in this sample. We quantified smoking exposure severity for each sibling reflecting time and quantity of MSDP, centered relative to the sibling pair's average (i.e., within-family centered, indicating child-specific effects attributable MSDP exposure) and controlling for the sibling average MSDP (i.e., between-family component, indicating familial confounding related to MSDP). We found that child-specific MSDP was associated with global DNAm, and CNTNAP2, CYP1A1, and MYO1G methylation after covariate adjustment, corroborating emerging evidence for a potentially causal pathway between MSDP and DNAm. There was some evidence that child-specific CNTNAP2 and MYO1G methylation partially explained associations between MSDP and ADHD-HI symptoms, though only on one measure (of two). Future studies focused on replication of these findings in a longitudinal genetic design could further solidify the associations found in the current study.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				SEP	2024	60	9			SI		1639	1654		10.1037/dev0001747	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001747								38661663					WOS:001324665800007

Developmental Cascades From Maternal Preconception Stress to Child Behavior Problems: Testing Multilevel Preconception, Prenatal, and Postnatal Influences	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Although maternal stress during pregnancy and even before conception shapes offspring risk for mental health problems, relatively little is known about the mechanisms through which these associations operate. In theory, preconception and prenatal stress may affect offspring mental health by influencing child responses to postnatal caregiving. To address this knowledge gap, this study had two aims. First, we examined associations between preconception and prenatal stress with child temperament profiles at age four using multilevel assessment of maternal perceived stress and stress physiology. Second, we tested child temperament profiles as moderators of associations between observed parenting behaviors during a parent-child free-play interaction when children were 4 years old and child behavior problems 1 year later. Latent profile analyses yielded four distinct child temperament profiles: inhibited, exuberant, regulated low reactive, and regulated high reactive. Consistent with hypotheses, preconception, and prenatal stress each independently predicted the likelihood of children having temperament profiles characterized by higher negative emotionality and lower regulation. Specifically, preconception perceived stress and prenatal cortisol predicted likelihood of children having an exuberant temperament, whereas prenatal perceived stress predicted likelihood of children having an inhibited temperament. Contrary to hypotheses, temperament profiles did not moderate predictions of child behavior problems from observed parenting behaviors; however, responsive parenting behaviors inversely predicted child behavior problems independently of child temperament. These findings add to growing evidence regarding effects of preconception factors on child outcomes and underscore a central role for responsive parenting behaviors in predicting more favorable child mental health independent of child temperament.

Longitudinal Effects of Prenatal Alcohol Exposure on Visual Neurodevelopment Over Infancy	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) affects neurodevelopment in over 59 million individuals globally. Prior studies using dichotomous categorization of alcohol use and comorbid substance exposures provide limited knowledge of how prenatal alcohol specifically impacts early human neurodevelopment. In this longitudinal cohort study from Cape Town, South Africa, PAE is measured continuously-characterizing timing, dose, and drinking patterns (i.e., binge drinking). High-density electroencephalography (EEG) during a visual-evoked potential (VEP) task was collected from infants aged 8 to 52 weeks with prenatal exposure exclusively to alcohol and matched on sociodemographic factors to infants with no substance exposure in utero. First trimester alcohol exposure related to altered timing of the P1 VEP component over the first 6 months postnatally, and first trimester binge drinking exposure altered timing of the P1 VEP components such that increased exposure was associated with longer VEP latencies while increasing age was related to shorter VEP latencies (n = 108). These results suggest alcohol exposure in the first trimester may alter visual neurodevelopmental timing in early infancy. Exploratory individual-difference analysis across infants with and without PAE tested the relation between VEP latencies and myelination for a subsample of infants with usable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T1w and T2w scans collected at the same time point as EEG (n = 47). Decreased MRI T1w/T2w ratios (an indicator of myelin) in the primary visual cortex (n = 47) were linked to longer P1 VEP latencies. Results from these two sets of analyses suggest that prenatal alcohol and postnatal myelination may both separately impact VEP latency over infancy.

However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship are unclear. The present study used a multimethod approach to simultaneously examine the mediating role of the developmental trajectories of observed parenting quality (support, stimulation, and structure) and children's functional brain networks (small-worldness) from infancy into the preschool period in a sample of 233 children and their biological mothers. The results revealed a potential sleeper effect: Prenatal exposure to risk was negatively related to child self-regulation during the preschool period, but not during infancy. Parenting quality remained relatively stable over time, whereas small-worldness showed an increase during infancy, followed by a decrease into the preschool age period. These developmental changes did not mediate the relation between prenatal risk and child self-regulation. Prenatal exposure to risk was related to lower levels of maternal support during infancy, but did not affect the development of parenting quality over time. Prenatal risk was also not related to the growth rate of small-worldness in young children. However, the developmental changes in small-worldness predicted individual differences in child self-regulation. These findings suggest that children generally have the potential to benefit from positive postnatal parenting environments, regardless of the levels of prenatal risk. A potential target for intervention efforts based on the current findings might be related to postnatal experiences that impact the development of functional brain networks, which in turn could affect the development of child self-regulation.

However, because prematurity is related to obstetrical and neonatal complications, it is unclear what may drive the effect. Effortful control also has a strong heritable component; therefore, environmental factors during pregnancy and the neonatal period may interact with genetic factors to predict effortful control development. In this study, we aimed to dissect the influences of genetics, prematurity, and neonatal and obstetrical complications on the development of effortful control from 12 months to 10 years using a twin cohort. This study used data from the Arizona Twin Project, an ongoing longitudinal study of approximately 350 pairs of twins. Twins were primarily Hispanic/Latinx (23.8%-27.1%) and non-Hispanic/Latinx White (53.2%-57.8%), and families ranged in socioeconomic status with around one third falling below or near the poverty line. Of the twins, 62.6% were born prematurely. Effortful control was assessed via parent report at six waves. There was not a significant relationship between gestational age and effortful control regardless of whether obstetrical and neonatal complications were controlled for. Biometric twin modeling revealed that the attentional focusing subdomain of effortful control was highly heritable. Gestational age did not moderate genetic and environmental estimates.

Changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) may represent a potential mechanism; however, findings are heterogeneous and limited to early infancy. This preregistered study examined whether mode of birth (vaginal birth compared with elective or emergency cesarean section) affects DNAm at birth, in childhood, and adolescence and whether these effects are modified by the postnatal care environment, specifically by breastfeeding and mother-infant bonding. Using data from 876 mother-infant dyads from the U.K. Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, we examined differentially methylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides and regions associated with mode of birth. DNAm was quantified using Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip in cord blood (at birth) and in peripheral blood (at 7 and 15-17 years). Analyses controlled for maternal age, education, smoking during pregnancy, child sex, gestational week at birth, and batch effects. We also examined interactions of mode of birth with breastfeeding practices and mother-infant bonding. In cord blood, two cytosine-phosphate-guanine dinucleotides (cg05230316; cg13230077) were linked to mode of birth (pFDR < .050). DNAm in childhood or adolescence was not statistically associated with mode of birth (pFDR > .050), and breastfeeding and mother-infant bonding were not moderators (p > .050). Overall, findings suggest mode of birth may have a small effect on cord blood DNAm, but these effects may not persist into later developmental stages. Other postnatal influences should be considered, and further investigation is needed to address study limitations.

J	Kang, J				Kang, Jeehye			Children of Immigrants' Behavioral Trajectories and Family Processes: Using an Integrative Developmental Model	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Using an integrative developmental model, this study revisited the "immigrant paradox" in early behavioral development, differentiating immigrant background from race and examining the role of family processes (family structure, stability, racial/ethnic socialization) in disparities between immigrant and U.S.-origin children. Growth-curve analyses on a sample of children aged 5-7 (N = 12,520) from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten class of 2010-2011 data set revealed distinct behavioral trajectories based on parental country of origin. Some groups outperformed the racially matched U.S.-origin peers by improving faster (internalizing behaviors: Salvadoran) or maintaining their advantages (internalizing: Mexican, Dominican; externalizing: Mexican, Salvadoran, Guatemalan, South American, and Dominican), while others faced continued challenges (externalizing behaviors: Japanese, Thai) or exhibited a nuanced pattern such as beginning with an advantage but deteriorating faster (internalizing: Cuban). The time-varying, country-of-origin-specific family processes fully or partly explained some disparities (except for Asian), emphasizing the need for a sociocultural understanding of the distinct strengths and limitations in racial-ethnic minority families. This contextualized knowledge is crucial for promoting healthy child development.

The present study tests whether older children (6-7-year-olds) are more skeptical than younger children (4-5-year-olds) about surprising claims that lack supporting evidence because they expect informants to provide evidence for them. To test this hypothesis, we presented 140 4-7-year-old children (47-96 months, 46.4% girls, 53.6% boys, 86.4% with at least one parent who completed a BA degree, 50% parents with income above median) with a series of vignettes. In each vignette, the protagonist wanted to accomplish a task and needed to select the most appropriate object for that task. Before deciding which object to use, the protagonist heard a surprising claim about one of the object's properties, presented with or without supporting evidence. For example, in the supporting explanation condition, the informant stated that the smallest object was the heaviest and that they knew because they had lifted the objects. Children were then asked whether the protagonist knew which object to use and why. Contrary to expectation, children across all ages typically indicated that the protagonist had sufficient knowledge, regardless of whether an informant provided supporting evidence or not. However, with increasing age, children became more skeptical of both supported and unsupported surprising claims and increasingly stated that the protagonist should not select the object suggested by the informant. Finally, when asked to justify this judgment, older children were more likely than younger to express skepticism toward the claims, especially when presented without supporting evidence.

To disentangle the respective influence of accumulated factual knowledge and executive functions (inhibition, working memory, and cognitive flexibility) on (a) the development of categorization abilities in the food domain and (b) differences in this development by child characteristics (i.e., food neophobia), we conducted two experiments. The first experiment assessed 4-6-year-old children's (n = 122) ability to taxonomically categorize food at the superordinate level of categorization. The second experiment tested 3-6-year-old children's (n = 100) ability to cross-categorize the same food according to two different relationships alternatively (i.e., taxonomic and thematic). Results indicate that accumulated factual knowledge and executive functions mediated both the effect of age and the effect of food neophobia on categorization performance. Notably, the specific executive functions involved may vary depending on the categorization abilities tested, whereas world knowledge was always a prerequisite. Overall, this research highlights the complex interplay between accumulated factual knowledge, executive functions, and child characteristics in shaping the development of categorization abilities.

Dynamic Coupling of Maternal Sensitivity and Toddlers' Responsive/Assertive Behaviors Predicts Children's Behavior Toward Peers During the Preschool Years	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We examined the extent to which dynamic coupling of (a) maternal sensitivity and (b) children's responsive and assertive behaviors toward mothers during a semistructured play session predicts children's responsive and assertive behavior toward an unfamiliar peer at 39 months and a close friend at 58 and 66 months. Maternal and child behaviors were rated in 30-s epochs during play when children were 32 months old (Time 1; N = 128; 66 girls). Children were rated on their responsiveness and assertiveness toward an unfamiliar peer in the early preschool years (Time 2) and toward a friend in the late preschool years (Time 3). Residual dynamic structural equation models showed that stronger positive contemporaneous coupling of maternal sensitivity and children's responsiveness in a given 30-s epoch of the play session predicted greater observed responsiveness toward a friend in the late preschool years, after controlling for mean levels of maternal sensitivity and child responsiveness. On the other hand, positive contemporaneous coupling of maternal sensitivity and child assertiveness predicted children's higher levels of observed assertiveness toward an unfamiliar peer in the early preschool years, after controlling for mean levels of maternal sensitivity and child assertiveness. Results suggest that the dynamic coupling of specific positive behaviors during mother-child interaction may provide children with social scripts to draw on in diverse peer contexts.

We began tracking the impacts of this pandemic for 633 first-year college students from four U.S. universities (M-age = 18.8 years) in Spring 2020 and followed students to Spring 2023. Students provided narratives about the impacts of COVID-19 and reports of mental health concerns, identity development, well-being. Students reported concerns for mental health, identity, and well-being during the first year of COVID-19 impacts. The return to in-person activities predicted broad increases in narrative growth and concomitant decreases in COVID-19 stressors, increases in identity exploration and commitment, and increases in psychological and academic well-being. Changes in COVID-19 stressors and narrative growth served as mediators between the return to in-person activities around campus and student outcomes. Findings expand insights of development and mental health across much of this generation-defining event.					; Booker, Jordan/AAE-8237-2021	Pasupathi, Monisha/0000-0001-9105-4554; Fivush, Robyn/0000-0003-3526-1588; Greenhoot, Andrea Follmer/0000-0002-8517-6149; Booker, Jordan/0000-0001-8787-8585													0012-1649	1939-0599				OCT	2024	60	10					1870	1884		10.1037/dev0001767	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001767		AUG 2024						39207414					WOS:001300885400001

Yet, this label ignores the vast heterogeneity within Chinese Americans and implies that they are immune to environmental stressors. Using an 8-year longitudinal study of 444 (54% female; initial Mage = 13-year-old) Chinese American adolescents, we identified two (well- vs. poorly adjusted) concurrent and three (stably well-adjusted, improved, and risk) latent transition profiles from early adolescence to emerging adulthood based on six indicators of academic, behavioral, and socioemotional functioning. Multilevel modeling revealed higher levels of family economic stress or discrimination independently associated with higher likelihood to be in the subgroup of adolescents with poorly adjusted patterns across development. Within an individual, Chinese American adolescents were more likely to have worse adjustment patterns in the year when they experienced higher economic stress or discrimination relative to other study years, suggesting that their adjustment are sensitive to the fluctuation of stress level during development. Longitudinally, those who experienced higher family economic stress or discrimination at early adolescence were more likely to become at risk when they reached adulthood. Higher discrimination predicted the likelihood to be in the improved groups but only among adolescents with low (but not high) economic stress, suggesting that the influence of discrimination may vary by family socioeconomic status. Findings (a) challenge the model minorities assumption, (b) highlight the importance of capturing multiple ecological contexts associated with heterogeneous development among Chinese American adolescents, and (c) provide longitudinal evidence to social policies aiming to reduce wealth disparities and anti-Asian racism.

This study examined how the detailed timing of this input relates to children's vocabulary at 3 years of age in 64 mother-child dyads (male = 28; female = 36; White = 69%, Black = 31%). Acoustical analysis of turn taking in mother-child dialogue found that more consistently timed maternal responses (lower response latency variability) were associated (r = .42, p < .001) with higher vocabulary (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, third edition) scores. In mothers with consistently timed responses, the complexity (mean length of utterance) of their child-directed speech significantly predicted (r = .53, p = .002) their children's vocabulary. This suggests that predictably timed contingent maternal responses provide an important learning cue that supports language development beyond the content of language input itself.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				2024 AUG 29	2024										10.1037/dev0001819	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001819		AUG 2024						39207412					WOS:001300877700001

Number and Domain Both Affect the Relation Between Executive Function and Mathematics Achievement: A Study of Children's Executive Function With and Without Numbers	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Magnitude processing and executive functions (EFs) have emerged as robust predictors of mathematics achievement. However, the nature of these associations is still unclear. For example, it is uncertain if EFs applied in the context of domain-specific mathematical cognition (i.e., EFs applied while processing numbers) are more closely related to mathematics achievement than EFs applied in nonnumerical, domain-general contexts. Also, how distinct EF domains-that is, working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility-and contents-that is, numerical versus nonnumerical-moderate the association between magnitude processing and mathematics achievement has not been fully understood. To address these issues, we investigated how magnitude processing, EFs applied to nonnumerical and numerical task stimuli, and their interactions were associated with mathematics achievement. Three hundred fifty-nine Brazilian third- to fifth-grade (8-10 years old) students completed measures of working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility with numerical and nonnumerical task versions, nonsymbolic and symbolic magnitude comparison, and mathematics achievement. A series of regression models indicated that nonsymbolic and symbolic magnitude processing are consistently associated with mathematics achievement, even when controlling for working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility measured with both numerical and nonnumerical contents. All EF measures were associated with mathematics achievement. However, cognitive flexibility measured with numerical content showed the strongest association. Results support the hypothesis that magnitude processing and EFs are uniquely associated with mathematics achievement. Furthermore, EFs measured with nonnumerical and numerical contents related differently to mathematics achievement, even when controlling for symbolic and nonsymbolic magnitude processing, suggesting they encompass somewhat distinct cognitive processes. Public Significance Statement<br /> In this study, we showed that nonsymbolic and symbolic magnitude processing and different types of executive functions are predictors of mathematics achievement in a sample of third- to fifth-grade children (8-10 years old) from a developing country. In particular, we observed stronger associations between mathematics achievement and symbolic magnitude processing and cognitive flexibility measured with numerical contents. Interestingly, inhibitory control measured with nonnumerical content had weak correlations with mathematics achievement.

Exploration of Auditory Statistical Learning, Socioeconomic Status, and Language Outcomes in Bangladeshi Children: A Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Auditory statistical learning, or the ability to detect statistical regularities in continuously presented stimuli, is thought to be one element that underlies language acquisition. Prior studies have uncovered behavioral and neural correlates of statistical learning, yet additional work is needed from low- and middle-income countries to explore whether statistical learning varies across cultures or underlies associations often found between socioeconomic status (SES) and language outcomes. In the present study, we explored the feasibility of using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to explore auditory statistical learning in Bangladesh, a lower-middle-income country. Participants were 102 2-year-old (M = 25.72 months, SD = 2.07 months) and 125 5-year-old children (M = 62.35 months, SD = 2.46 months) living in a low-income urban neighborhood of Dhaka (average family income of 28,145.13 Bangladeshi Takas or 260.06 U.S. dollars per month). We also collected measures of SES and language outcomes. Brain responses during the statistical learning paradigm could be detected with fNIRS in both two- and 5-year-olds, with 2-year-olds exhibiting a higher response to predictable sequences and 5-year-olds exhibiting higher responses to unpredictable sequences. fNIRS correlates of statistical learning were not related to language outcomes but were associated with SES in the 5-year-old cohort. This study demonstrates the utility of employing fNIRS to study the neural correlates of statistical learning in low- and middle-income countries and the feasibility of expanding the representativeness of the existing literature. These findings also highlight potential areas for inquiry into how SES may relate to individual differences in statistical learning responses.

Kiley			Able and Willing: Infants Selectively Seek Help From Competent and Benevolent Others	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Young children often encounter unsolvable problems with which they require others' help. To receive adequate assistance, children must be savvy about whom they seek help from: Effective helpers must possess both the ability to help (e.g., competence) and a willingness to do so (e.g., benevolence). Although past work suggests that information about competence and benevolence can inform young children's help-seeking behavior, it remains unclear how and whether children utilize said factors independently of each other. Furthermore, it is unclear whether they can generalize potential helpers' competence from one task to another. The current experiments examined whether 22- to 23-month-olds confronted with a broken toy selectively sought help from agents who had previously demonstrated either competence (Experiment 1) or benevolence (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, infants preferred to seek help from a competent agent who successfully opened a closed box over one who failed to do so. In Experiment 2, infants selectively sought help from a benevolent agent who helped a third party by returning a lost ball, over an agent who stole the ball instead. These patterns of selectivity were not driven by associative valence matching; in Experiment 3, infants showed no preference for an agent who was itself helped versus an agent who was hindered. These results suggest that before their second birthday, infants independently utilize cues to both competence and benevolence to inform their help seeking, using information generalized from novel contexts. We discuss the potential nature of this generalization as well as directions for future work.

The Effect of Unconditional Cash Transfers on Maternal Assessments of Children's Early Language and Socioemotional Development: Experimental Evidence From US Families Residing in Poverty	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Economic disadvantage has often been associated with poorer performance on measures of early childhood development. However, the causal impacts of income on child development remain unclear. The present study uses data from the Baby's First Years randomized control trial to identify the causal impact of unconditional cash transfers on maternal reports of early childhood development. One thousand racially and ethnically diverse mothers residing in poverty were recruited from four U.S. metropolitan areas shortly after giving birth. Mothers were randomized to receive either a $333/month or $20/month unconditional cash transfer for the first several years of their child's life. Maternal reports of language and socioemotional development, concerns for developmental delay, and enrollment in early intervention services were collected annually at the time of the child's first, second, and third birthdays. In this registered report, we document no statistically detectable impacts of the high-cash gift on maternal reports of child development. We discuss the significance and implications of these findings.

J	Valentini, B; Vergauwe, E				Valentini, Beatrice; Vergauwe, Evie			Do School-Aged Children Spontaneously Use Refreshing as Maintenance Strategy in Working Memory? Testing the Effects of Free Time and Motivation	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Working memory is the system responsible for maintaining information that is no longer available. Given the long-term impact of working memory in people's lives, it is fundamental to understand which mechanisms underlie it and how these develop with age. A recently proposed mechanism to explain working memory development is attentional refreshing. Refreshing is an attention-based maintenance mechanism that improves the accessibility of mental representations. It is assumed to operate serially, with attention cycling from one mental representation to the other, in order to reactivate all to-be-maintained items. Although it has been suggested that its efficiency increases in children between 7 and 14 years old, recent results contradict this notion. In this article, we modify several important task characteristics of a recently developed paradigm used to detect whether refreshing is spontaneously used in children and to examine whether evidence for spontaneous refreshing could be found. All participants were recruited in public schools in Geneva (Switzerland). In Experiment 1 (68 8-year-olds, 32 girls and 36 boys, and 62 12-year-olds, 35 girls and 27 boys) and Experiment 2 (26 8-year-olds, 11 girls and 15 boys, and 49 12-year-olds, 27 girls and 22 boys), we show that increasing children's motivation and providing more explicitly free time do not result in the spontaneous occurrence of refreshing in 8- and 12-year-olds. The absence of evidence for refreshing in a simple, commonly-used working memory task, despite theory-driven modifications aimed at encouraging it, casts some doubts on the notion that refreshing is crucially involved in children's working memory functioning and development.

Data were collected once annually from 2015 to 2017 with 220 Muslim American youth (M = 14.20, SD = 0.94) in the Midwest United States (girls = 53.2%; boys = 42.3%; missing = 4.5%). Participants were Arab (62.3%), Somali (15.9%), and African American (8.6%), among other ethnic groups (less than 2%). Latent growth curve models indicated that Muslim and ethnic identity centrality displayed negative trajectories and that American identity centrality increased over time. Surprisingly, religious discrimination was not associated with social identity centrality trajectories. This research suggests that Muslim American youths' minoritized social identities develop similarly, whereas youths' American social identity develops differently than these identities.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				OCT	2024	60	10					1855	1869		10.1037/dev0001806	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001806		AUG 2024						39172426					WOS:001300881600001

A Longitudinal, Mixed Methods Study Exploring the Impact of Civic Engagement on Psychosocial Outcomes Across Early to Mid Adulthood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Civic engagement during emerging adulthood plays a pivotal role in fostering a sense of community responsibility, providing a sense of societal purpose, and contributes to improved psychological adjustment. In this mixed-method longitudinal study, we further explored how civic engagement and psychological adjustment codevelop across emerging adulthood. Participants were drawn from The Future's Study, a Canadian longitudinal study capturing the transition to adulthood in Southwestern Ontario. The sample was predominantly White (81%), female identifying (71%), and largely affluent with 5.8% reporting lower than average family income. At ages 23, 26, and 32, participants completed measures of civic engagement, depression, and optimism; at age 26, participants had the opportunity to also complete a life story interview where they were asked to recount a key community scene from their lives and reflect on its impact. Random intercept cross-lagged panel models illustrated that civic engagement across ages 23-32 reduced loneliness concurrently and longitudinally. No cross-lagged associations were found for depression or optimism. Four themes illuminated the role of civic engagement in buffering against loneliness during emerging adulthood and into midlife: community unites people through a shared vision, fosters meaningful and long-lasting connections, solidifies the importance of leaving a legacy for future generations, and contributes to personal growth via insight into others' lives, which illuminated an awareness of one's own social advantages and privilege. These results illustrate that the pathway between increased civic engagement and reduced loneliness may be due, in part, to intrinsic and collective motives that tie together personal growth, identity, and generativity.

J	Ho, P; Brown, BB				Ho, Pauline; Brown, B. Bradford			Black Youths' Ethnic and Racial Identity Development From Childhood to Emerging Adulthood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This qualitative study employed a retrospective inquiry design to trace changes in the course of ethnic and racial identity (ERI) development of 20 African American college students (18-22 years old) attending a large, predominantly White university in the Midwestern United States. Through interviews, participants recalled life experiences that they considered crucial to their understanding of their own ERI in childhood, adolescence, and emerging adulthood. Using longitudinal qualitative analysis, three distinct pathways of ERI development were identified: consolidating (no change to the understanding they developed earlier in life), cumulative (successive additions or expansions to their current understanding of their own ERI), and transformative (their ERI trajectory is qualitatively altered by a turning point event). Results revealed that the development of ERI components is influenced by the interplay of contextual, individual, and developmental factors, along with the ongoing meaning-making of identity-relevant experiences. Findings lend empirical support for adopting a lifespan approach to ERI development, demonstrating ERI development as a dynamically interactive and continuous process. Public Significance Statement This study suggests that ethnic and racial identity (ERI) development results from the interplay of various factors influencing ERI, with ERI also mutually influencing those factors over time. The study provides empirical support for the lifespan model of ERI development and highlights differences in ERI development pathways and changes in identity concerns.

National Disparities Favoring Males Are Reflected in Girls' Implicit Associations About Gender and Academic Subjects	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Based on data for N = 2,756 children (1,410 girls; Mage = 8.10 years) from 16 data sets spanning five nations, this study investigated relations between national gender disparities and children's beliefs about gender and academic subjects. One national-level gender disparity involved inequalities in socioeconomic standing favoring adult males over females (U.N. Human Development Index). The other involved national-level gaps in standardized math achievement, favoring boys over girls (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study Grade 4). Three novel findings emerged. First, girls' results from a Child Implicit Association Test showed that implicit associations linking boys with math and girls with reading were positively related to both national male advantages in socioeconomic standing and national boy advantages in Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study. Second, these relations were obtained for implicit but not explicit measures of children's beliefs linking gender and academic subjects. Third, implicit associations linking gender to academic subjects increased significantly as a function of children's age. We propose a psychological account of why national gender disparities are likely to influence children's developing implicit associations about gender and academic subjects, especially for girls.

DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Using a novel exchange paradigm, we demonstrate that Australian preschool children from middle to high socioeconomic backgrounds may be capable of executing a mutually beneficial exchange. In Study 1, 3- to 5-year-old children completed a tower building task, in which they were given an opportunity to make trading choices via preset options that could allow both them and a puppet to succeed. A majority of children across age groups selected the efficient trade option over other alternatives. In Study 2, we modified the task to have less structure. With no preset options, 5-year-old children initiated an efficient exchange to a greater extent than younger children. A different task that relied on distributing desirable versus less desirable rewards (stickers) revealed a complementary pattern. The two studies shed light on the onset and developmental trajectory of a prerequisite skill for negotiation: children's capacity to initiate and execute a mutually beneficial deal, varying across different task contexts.

Infant "negative reactive" tendencies have been robustly linked to resting brain activity profiles that confer risk for maladaptive socioemotional outcomes. The present study examines whether and how caregiver behavior in early infancy may interact with infant negative reactivity to alter the extent to which such tendencies predict risk-related brain activity profiles. In the present study, 51 mothers (all White; age M = 32 years, SD = 3; 70.8% monthly household income >3,400 U.S. dollars) and their infants (39.2% female at birth) participated. We measured infant negative reactivity and maternal contingent responsiveness to infant's gaze during mother-infant interactions at age 4 months. At 10-11 months, we assessed infants' resting electroencephalographic (EEG) 6-9 Hz frontal asymmetry (a marker of risk for maladaptive regulatory behaviors and withdrawal), infant fearful withdrawal, and infant empathic behavior. We found that maternal contingent responsiveness to 4-month-old infant's gaze in naturalistic interactions moderated the relation between 4-month infant negative reactivity and 11-month resting EEG asymmetry. Results suggest that maternal contingent responsiveness alters the extent to which early reactive tendencies end up "embedded" in infant brain activity profiles. Exploratory analyses revealed that the interaction between maternal contingent responsiveness and infant reactivity predicting infant resting EEG asymmetry, in turn predicted infants' fearful withdrawal and empathic behaviors also assessed at 10-11 months. Findings demonstrate the critical buffering role of maternal contingent responsive behaviors in reducing potential maladaptive neural and socioemotional outcomes.

J	Lazaro, V; Bian, L				Lazaro, Vanessa; Bian, Lin			Children's Social Preference for Peers Engaged in Brilliance-Required Activities: The Impact of Gender and Race	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Women's underrepresentation in academic fields and professions emphasizing high intellectual talents persists as a prominent societal issue. To explore early antecedents of this gender imbalance, the present study investigated the developmental changes in children's social preference of boys and girls who pursue brilliance-required (vs. effort-required) activities. Importantly, we took an intersectional perspective to explore whether children consider target race in their social preference. Five- to 9-year-old U.S. children (N = 207; M-age = 7.53; 104 girls and 103 boys; 48% White) were presented with pairs of Asian, Black, and White characters matched in gender. One character was depicted as enjoying a game requiring high intellectual talents and the other enjoyed a game requiring effort. Participants were then asked to choose the character that they liked more, as an indicator of their social preference. With age, children became increasingly likely to prefer White boys and girls of color (i.e., Black and Asian girls) pursuing activities requiring brilliance (vs. activities requiring effort). In contrast, children did not develop increasing social preference for White girls or boys of color who opt in for brilliance-required activities. Our data suggest that, as early as elementary school years, children's social preference in contexts valuing sheer brilliance becomes both gendered and racialized. These findings highlight the importance of using an intersectional approach to identify the specific developmental processes that contribute to social disparities in brilliance-required contexts.

Direct and Indirect Pathways Linking Gentrification to Adolescent Reading and Math Achievement via Educational Aspirations and Psychological Distress	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examined how living in a gentrifying neighborhood may impact adolescents' reading and math achievement via educational aspirations and psychological distress and asked whether these pathways differ according to socioeconomic status and race. A framework combining theories of adolescent development and neighborhood effects was empirically tested using a racially diverse sample of adolescents living in urban neighborhoods in North Carolina matched to administrative school records and census data (N = 1,045, M-age = 12, 8% American Indian, 4% Asian, 32% Black, 62% White, 15% multiracial, 16% Latinx, categories not mutually exclusive). At the population level, structural equation models found no relation between the extent of gentrification occurring in youths' neighborhood of residence and reading and math achievement, educational aspirations, or psychological distress. However, moderated mediation models revealed a positive association between gentrification and psychological distress among youth with low (but not high) subjective family economic status, leading to a small negative indirect effect of gentrification on math achievement. The link between gentrification and increased psychological distress was largest among Black youth with low subjective family economic status, who may face both heightened racism and classism-related social stressors as their neighborhood gentrifies. Findings have theoretical and policy implications, as they challenge the assumption that living in proximity to higher income, higher educated peers will benefit youth from disadvantaged neighborhoods.

J	Mädamürk, K; Kikas, E				Madamurk, Kaja; Kikas, Eve			The Development of Math Skills From Grades 1 to 12: Novel Findings Using Person-Oriented Approach	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The development of math skills is widely studied, but there is a lack of longitudinal studies investigating person-oriented developmental patterns of math skills. The present study aims to describe profiles of students with various calculation and word-problem solving skills from Grades 1 to 9, as well as the developmental trajectories of these profiles, how profiles are related to students' further educational pathways, and whether having a specific skill profile in Grade 9 is related to the results of math and language exams at the end of Grade 12. The sample included 1,023 Estonian students who completed calculation and word-problem solving tests in Grades 1, 3, 6, and 9 (ages 6-16 years old). Educational pathway information and results of the math and language exam in Grade 12 were retrieved from the Estonian Education Information System's registry. Socioeconomic status was determined via parental education level. Overall, results indicated that math skills were positively interrelated between the school years. However, person-oriented approach demonstrated that less than half of students tended to stay in a similar profile from Grades 1 to 9. This suggests that, in terms of math skills, most students have diverse developmental trajectories from elementary school through the end of middle school. Profiles were also related to further educational pathways and high school exam results. This study complements previous variable-oriented research to provide unique and valuable information regarding the development of math skills.

J	Marshall, DA; Meins, E				Marshall, Dean A.; Meins, Elizabeth			Probability Errors in Children's Judgements About the Likelihood of Social Characteristics	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The studies reported here investigated mechanisms underlying children's tendency to commit the conjunction fallacy (judging that a conjunction of two events is more likely than one of the events in isolation) when judging people's characteristics. Study 1 investigated these errors in 4- and 5-year-olds (N = 58) using a newly developed social judgement task in which children judged whether a conjunction or one of its elements would apply to a protagonist. Children made conjunction fallacy errors at chance level. Study 2 (N = 71) replicated these findings using an adapted version of the task, in which children separately judged the likelihood of the conjunction and each of its events. Study 3 investigated age-related changes in conjunction fallacy errors in a sample of 148 children aged 4 to 11 years old and 130 adults. This study also investigated how providing background information on the protagonist influenced error rate. Unlike younger children, 10- and 11-year-olds committed the conjunction fallacy at chance level in the absence of background information, but providing information consistent with the likely component of the conjunction significantly increased their error rate. Adults' error rate also significantly increased after the introduction of background information. Across all three studies, conjunction fallacy errors were unrelated to cognitive and social-cognitive abilities, such as verbal ability, theory of mind, and inhibitory control (Studies 1 and 2), and prejudice and hindsight bias (Study 3). These findings suggest that it is only in the second decade of life that children use social information to inform their judgements about people and that social decision-making errors are not determined by core aspects of cognitive and social-cognitive development.

Despite evidence, temperament research remains focused on a few prominent dimensions of temperament, without adequately addressing covariance among dimensions and temperament types. Using longitudinal twin data, we took a person-centered statistical approach to identify temperament types and examined continuity and change across five developmental periods (N-infancy = 602; N-toddlerhood = 522; N-early childhood = 390; N-late childhood = 718; N-early adolescence = 700). We then examined the genetic and environmental etiology of temperament types. Twins were boys and girls (51-53% female), primarily Hispanic/Latinx (23-30%) and non-Hispanic/Latinx White (56-63%), and from socioeconomically diverse families (28-38% near-or-below the poverty line). Using latent profile analysis, we identified three temperament types at each age characterized by negative reactivity and dysregulation, positive reactivity and strong self-regulation, and moderate reactivity and regulation. Latent transition analyses revealed considerable continuity in membership type for "negative dysregulated" beginning in infancy, log odds = 1.58 (SE = .65) to 3.16 (SE = .77), p < .01, of remaining relative to transitioning to "typical expressive", and "positive well-regulated" beginning in early childhood, log odds = 1.41 (SE = .56) to 2.25 (SE = .47), p < .05. Twin analyses revealed moderate heritability and a consistent role of the shared environment on positive well-regulated, with negative dysregulated and typical expressive also moderately heritable with the shared environment being important at some ages. Findings support the presence of theorized biologically based temperament types that develop rapidly in infancy and toddlerhood and provide a foundation for the study of individual differences and risk and resilience processes across the lifespan. Public Significance Statement<br /> Children can be classified into three types based on their temperament: negative dysregulated, positive well-regulated, or typical expressive. These types develop rapidly across infancy and toddlerhood becoming more continuous by early childhood. Types are both heritable and influenced by the early environment, supporting a complex interplay between temperament and sociocultural context when predicting children and adolescent's adaptation.					cheng, cheuk hei/HMW-1591-2023	Murillo, Alexys/0000-0003-0851-8579													0012-1649	1939-0599				2024 AUG 22	2024										10.1037/dev0001828	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001828		AUG 2024						39172413					WOS:001300867800001

Maternal Emotion Socialization Trajectories in an Early-Childhood, Predominantly White Sample	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Several developmental theories identify caregiver emotion socialization (ES) as predicting multiple child psychological outcomes, including anxiety. The present study delineated developmental trajectories of mothers' ES practices, specifically the initial levels and growth across time of their supportive and nonsupportive responses to their young children's emotions. To contextualize the developmental role of these processes, we examined multiple predictors (i.e., maternal emotion dysregulation, child negative emotionality, demographic covariates) and one outcome (i.e., child anxiety) of ES trajectories, as well as how trajectories varied by emotion type-sadness, anger, or worry. We investigated these questions in a community sample of 173 predominantly White, non-Hispanic mother-child dyads who participated at four time points when children were aged 2-5 years, with assessments 1 year apart. Mothers reported on study variables. Results varied by ES type. Mothers' supportive global and emotion-specific ES were highly stable across time and did not relate to predictors, outcomes, or demographic covariates. Mothers endorsed gradual decreases in nonsupportive ES across time, with some variations across emotion type. Nonsupportive responses to worry and sadness each comprised two classes varying by intercept and slope. Nonsupportive worry responses linearly decreased, whereas nonsupportive sadness responses linearly increased. Across global and emotion-specific models, maternal emotion dysregulation, child negative emotionality, and demographic covariates showed unique relations with nonsupportive ES intercept and slope. Trajectories were mostly unrelated to later child anxiety, with the exception of class-specific differences for nonsupportive worry responses. Implications and future directions are discussed.

However, it remains unclear whether their developmental trajectories are distinct and the extent to which different aspects of cognitive functioning account for their development. We aimed to disentangle the developmental trajectories of bullying behaviors and conduct problems, test their interrelations across childhood, and assess associations with children's early cognitive functioning (executive functions, intelligent quotient [IQ], and theory of mind). Participants included 2,232 children from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study. We performed dual group-based trajectory modeling on combined parent and teacher reports of children's bullying behaviors and conduct problems at 5, 7, 10, and 12 years. We assessed associations with age 5 cognitive functioning using regression analyses. We identified five developmental trajectories for bullying behaviors and four for conduct problems. The developmental course of both behaviors was interrelated most strongly among those with high levels. A subgroup of children was likely to transition from conduct problems to bullying behaviors as they got older. Lower IQ was associated with both antisocial behavior trajectories, whereas lower theory of mind was only associated with conduct problems trajectories. The developmental course of bullying behaviors and conduct problems is distinct but linked across childhood. Interventions targeting bullying behaviors or conduct problems could benefit from more integration and should take into account children's cognitive functioning.

J	Török, G; Domberg, A; Ruggeri, A				Toeroek, Georgina; Domberg, Andreas; Ruggeri, Azzurra			Children Adapt Their Information Search to Goal and Statistical Structure of a Problem	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												To be efficient, problem solvers need to be adaptive, tailoring their information search to the specific problem at hand. Across two studies, we investigated the emergence and early development of children's ability to adapt their information search to a given goal (Studies 1 and 2) and to the statistical structure of the problem space (Study 2) to maximize effectiveness. In Study 1, 3-6-year-olds (n = 105) decided which of two cues to look up, the arms or the legs of two monsters, to predict the winner of a throwing or jumping challenge, knowing that monsters with long arms were good throwers and those with long legs were good jumpers. Children's ability to adaptively select relevant information and tailor their search to the goal increased with age, surpassing chance level between the ages of 4 and 5. Study 2 (7-14-year-olds and adults, n = 175) demonstrated this competence in a more complex task, additionally investigating whether children tailor their search to the statistical structure, that is, the distribution of cue values, in their search environment (e.g., how common long legs are). The results suggest high reliability in ignoring irrelevant cues (confirming the results from Study 1) and developmental patterns in children's preferential treatment of cues of differing statistical frequency. Together, these studies contribute to the literature on information search adaptiveness by tracing for the first time the emergence and developmental trajectory of children's ability to tailor predecisional search to the changing goals and environmental resources of the problem at hand.

Temporal Moral Attribution in US and Chinese School-Age Children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examines how children attribute moral responsibilities to their past and future actions and what role culture plays in children's temporal moral attribution. A total of 346 U.S. and Chinese 6-7 and 8- to 9-year-old children were randomly assigned to a past or future condition, in which they answered questions about their moral/immoral actions in hypothetical scenarios described as occurring in the last week or the next week. Whereas U.S. 8- to 9-year-olds favored more praise and reward for their future good deeds than past ones, Chinese 8- to 9-year-olds favored more praise and reward for their past good deeds than future ones. Chinese children also moralized their actions to a greater extent than U.S. children, and children reasoned about their moral/immoral actions in line with their cultural beliefs. Interesting age differences also emerged, suggesting the continuing development of mental time travel and moral cognition across middle childhood. The findings shed new light on the important role of time in moral judgment that is constrained by development progressions in mental time travel and specific to the cultural context.

Although covariate adjustment is typically used to test hypotheses, propensity score-based methods, including inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and marginal structural models (MSM), can strengthen inference and answer more nuanced, developmentally relevant questions. This article provides a didactic introduction to IPTW and MSM methods and demonstrates their use for testing the impact of environmental smoke exposure (continuous treatment) from 6 to 90 months on parent-reported attention deficit hyperactivity disorder behaviors in first grade for 1,053 children (51% male, 44% Black) in the Family Life Project. We highlight differences that result both in conclusions and in the evaluation of assumptions for IPTW and MSM relative to more traditional covariate adjustment methods.

J	Maheux, AJ; Burnell, K; Choukas-Bradley, S				Maheux, Anne J.; Burnell, Kaitlyn; Choukas-Bradley, Sophia			Bidirectional Associations Between Online and Offline Appearance Concerns During Early-to-Middle Adolescence	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												During early and middle adolescence, individuals are at heightened risk of poor body image and subsequent negative mental health outcomes, and the highly visual nature of social media may play a role in this process. It remains unclear, however, if appearance preoccupation on social media-such as appearance-related social media consciousness (ASMC)-influences offline body image, or if preexisting body image concerns influence online appearance preoccupation. The present study investigated between-person differences and potential bidirectional within-person associations in these experiences among eighth grade adolescents in the United States (n = 1,582; ages 11-15 years old; M-age = 13; 47.5% girls, 45.9% boys, 6.5% another gender identity; 37% Latine, 32% White, 18% Black, 7% Asian, 6% another racial/ethnic identity). Participants completed a longitudinal study over three waves within one academic year. Results indicated that within-person increases in ASMC preceded within-person increases in appearance-contingent self-worth and were bidirectionally associated with worse appearance esteem, with no differences in these associations by gender. Among girls only, self-objectification was associated with subsequent within-person increases in ASMC, but not vice versa. Findings indicate that online appearance preoccupation may influence and be reinforced by general body image concerns.

J	Tipper, Z; Kim, T; Friedman, O				Tipper, Zoe; Kim, Terryn; Friedman, Ori			Children (and Many Adults) Use Perceptual Similarity to Assess Relative Impossibility	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												People see some impossible events as more impossible than others. For example, walking through a solid wall seems more impossible if it is made of stone rather than wood. Across four experiments, we investigated how children and adults assess the relative impossibility of events, contrasting two kinds of information they may use: perceptual information and causal knowledge. In each experiment, participants were told about a wizard who could magically transform target objects into other things. Participants then assessed which of the two transformation spells would be easier or harder, a spell transforming a target object into a perceptual match (i.e., a similar-looking thing) or one transforming it into a causal match (e.g., an item made of similar materials). In Experiments 1-3, children aged 4-7 mainly thought that transformations into the perceptual match would be easier, though this tendency varied with age. Adults were overall split when choosing which spell would be easier. In Experiment 1, this was because of variations in their judgments across different pairs of spells; in Experiments 2 and 4, the split resulted because different subsets of adults preferred either the perceptual or causal match. Overall, these findings show that children, and many adults, use perceptual reasoning to assess relative impossibility.

J	Stallworthy, IC; Elison, JT; Berry, D				Stallworthy, Isabella C.; Elison, Jed T.; Berry, Daniel			The Infant Parasympathetic Nervous System Is Socially Embedded and Dynamic at Multiple Timescales, Within and Between People	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Human interpersonal capacities emerge from coordinated neural, biological, and behavioral activity unfolding within and between people. However, developmental research to date has allocated comparatively little focus to the dynamic processes of how social interactions emerge across these levels of analysis. Second-person neuroscience and dynamic systems approach together to offer an integrative framework for addressing these questions. This study quantified respiratory sinus arrhythmia and social behavior (similar to 360 observations per system) from 44 mothers and typically developing 9-month-old infants during a novel modified "still-face" (text message perturbation) task. Stochastic autoregression models indicate that the infant parasympathetic nervous system is coupled within and between people second by second and is sensitive to social context. Intraindividual, we found positive coupling between infants' parasympathetic nervous system activity and their social behavior in the subsequent second, but only during the moments and periods of active caregiver engagement. Between people, we found a bidirectional coregulatory feedback loop: Mothers' parasympathetic activity positively predicted that of their infant in the subsequent second, a form of synchrony that decreased during the text message perturbation and did not fully recover. Conversely, infant parasympathetic activity negatively predicted that of their mother at the subsequent second, a form of synchrony that was invariant over social context. Findings reveal unidirectional parasympathetic coupling within infants and a complementary allostatic feedback loop between mother and infant parasympathetic systems. They offer novel evidence of a dynamic, socially embedded parasympathetic system at previously undocumented timescales, contributing to both basic science and potential clinical targets to better support adaptive, multisystem social development.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				OCT	2024	60	10					1827	1841		10.1037/dev0001787	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001787		AUG 2024						39146077					WOS:001300917900001

Patterns of Childhood Maltreatment and Maternal Substance Use Disorder on the Development of Emerging Adult Offspring Substance Use	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Exposure to child maltreatment and maternal substance use disorder represent two highly consequential and co-occurring experiences of family-level adversity for the development of concerning substance use behaviors among offspring. The present study uses latent class analysis to identify how characteristics of childhood maltreatment and maternal substance use disorder naturally cluster. Further, this study investigates how distinct patterns of maltreatment and maternal substance use differentially predict emerging adult substance use in offspring. Participants (N = 405) were drawn from a longitudinal follow-up study of emerging adults who participated in a research summer camp program as children. Wave 1 of the study included 674 school-aged children with and without maltreatment histories, all of whom experienced low socioeconomic status. Patterns of child maltreatment experiences, based on coded Child Protective Services record data, and maternal substance use behaviors, per a diagnostic interview, were used to predict Wave 2 (emerging adulthood) substance use. Results indicated that children who were exposed to a pattern of multitype maltreatment and multitype maternal substance dependence, relative to those exposed to multitype maltreatment alone, reported greater alcohol dependence symptoms during emerging adulthood. Additionally, these same individuals reported greater past-year hard liquor consumption relative to those who experienced chronic, multitype maltreatment and maternal alcohol dependence. These findings highlight how a pattern of maternal polysubstance use and multitype maltreatment is particularly consequential for the intergenerational transmission of substance use behaviors. Public Significance Statement<br /> This study demonstrates that unique patterns of exposure to maltreatment and maternal substance use during childhood differentially inform substance use behaviors of offspring during emerging adulthood. Additionally, it provides greater opportunity for the identification of best-fitting interventions for families.

However, little is known about how parental mental health and beliefs about early childhood development shape such investments. We draw on a sample of young children and their primary caregiver from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (N = 3,000; M-age = 34.1 months; 48.5% girls) and examine how parental distress and beliefs predict investments in learning at home and how these, in turn, predict children's development across multiple domains. We examine these associations separately for infants/toddlers (0-35 months) and preschool-aged children (36-72 months), for whom enrollment in preprimary school is also included as an additional form of parent investment. Results showed different patterns of associations between the two age groups. Specifically, for infants and toddlers, parental distress and beliefs did not predict parent investments or child outcomes, but both access to learning materials and cognitive stimulation at home positively predicted child development in every domain. For preschool-aged children, parental beliefs positively predicted hours in preschool, and parental distress negatively predicted the availability of learning materials and cognitive stimulation at home; these three forms of parent investments each positively predicted children's outcomes across all developmental domains. Collectively, these findings deepen our understanding of parent factors that shape children's formal and informal learning experiences and point to several important areas for future research to more fully understand early childhood development in low-resource contexts.

Indeed, very few studies of prosocial development have included 12-month-old infants or examined how prosociality changes across the second year, and none has assessed individual differences in prosocial strategy use. This study investigated prosocial helping behaviors in a racially and socioeconomically diverse sample of 220 11- to 20-month-olds living in the United States (45.5% female; 61% Black; 67.2% low socioeconomic status). At 12 months (n = 153), >80% of infants helped an experimenter retrieve out-of-reach items. Modest increases in helping were observed across the second year of life. Individual differences in specific helping strategies were also detected. Infants who helped more by handing an item to an experimenter on one task (rather than placing the item in a target location) also helped more by handing on another task; similar patterns were found with placing. Moreover, the type of strategy was associated with age and sex: older infants and male infants used more placing. The high rates of helping by 12 months of age and the use of individual helping strategies demonstrate that infants have robust prosocial abilities beyond those previously documented. These findings contribute critical information about the typical development of prosocial behaviors in the largest and most racially and socioeconomically diverse sample of infants to date.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				2024 AUG 12	2024										10.1037/dev0001760	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001760		AUG 2024						39133601					WOS:001300832500001

However, the respective contributions of early and concurrent attachment security in adult RF remain unknown. This study examines the contributions of attachment security to the mother in early childhood and of concurrent attachment security to each parent in young adults' RF. Eighty-one low-risk participants (49 girls and 32 boys) from average income families took part in this longitudinal study. Attachment security was assessed at 4 years of age with a composite measure of mother-reported Attachment Q-Sort and observer ratings of the quality of mother-child interactions. At age 23, the Attachment Multiple Model Interview was administered to assess participants' attachment security to each parent. RF was coded from the participants' attachment narratives using the Reflective Functioning Scale. Attachment security to the mother at age 4 was found to be associated with RF in adulthood. Also, an interactive effect between attachment to the mother and attachment to the father in adulthood was related to RF, suggesting that attachment with one parent moderates the effect of attachment with the other parent on RF. These findings emphasize the importance of both early and concurrent attachment security in the capacity to understand mental states in adulthood.

However, sustained attention has largely been studied in either shared or independent contexts, leading to gaps in our understanding of how trade-offs between sustained attention to shared versus individual targets may predict later outcomes. We examined this question in a longitudinal sample of 1,290 children (49% female, 43% Black), living in predominately rural, low-income regions, using a naturalistic shared picture book reading task. Children's sustained attention to individual relative to shared targets during the book reading task was measured at 24 and 35 months. Using latent profile analysis, we identified four developmental profiles of children's attentional trajectories: three of the profiles differed in the extent that children' attention shifted toward more socially directed relative to individually directed attention; a fourth profile showed atypical decreases in both socially directed and individually directed attention across development. Importantly, heterogeneity in children's attentional profiles were associated with differences in executive functions at 48 months of age. Specifically, children who showed greater relative increases in socially directed attention had higher executive functions performance, whereas children with atypical decreases in attention showed substantial deficits in this domain. These findings reveal distinct longitudinal patterns of sustained attention in naturalistic contexts and show that heterogeneity in these patterns are robust predictors of subsequent executive functions. This person-centered approach provides novel insights into how quantitative and qualitative changes in attention may impact executive functions development and may help identify children at risk for nonnormative trajectories.

Sibling Disclosure and Adolescents' Coping From Before to During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The extraordinary disruptions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic created a unique context to investigate the links between family communication and adolescent adjustment. Given that widespread stay-at-home orders increased time spent in the family setting, the present study examined reciprocal links between older and younger adolescent siblings' disclosure toward each other and concurrent and prospective links between those disclosures and their own and their siblings' coping from before to during the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were two adolescent-aged siblings (older siblings: 51% female, M = 15.67 years; younger siblings: 48% female, M = 13.14 years) and one parent (85% mothers, M = 45.15 years) from 682 families (N = 2,046) in five Midwestern states in the United States. Participants completed web-based assessments on three occasions: Time 1 (March 2019-February 2020), Time 2 (May 2020-June 2020), and Time 3 (July 2020-February 2021). Using structural equation modeling, results revealed that the prospective reciprocal linkages between older and younger siblings' disclosures were often moderated by the gender composition of the sibling dyad. Further, older and younger siblings' disclosures were both concurrently associated with their own coping during the pandemic but not prospectively associated with later perceived coping. There were mixed findings regarding the actor and partner associations between siblings' disclosure and adolescents' perceived coping. Results emphasize the complexity and bidirectional nature of sibling disclosure and the potential protective effects of disclosing to siblings in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Theories of the underlying mechanisms differ: Accumulator models emphasize the accumulation of experience with words over time to yield a spurtlike pattern, while cognitive models attribute the spurt to cognitive changes. To test these theories, English-French monolingual and bilingual children with different exposure to each language were studied. Dense, longitudinal data were analyzed from 45 infants aged 16-30 months, whose expressive vocabulary was measured on a total of 617 occasions in English and/or French. Single-language (English and/or French), concept (number of concepts lexicalized across both languages), and word (sum of both languages) vocabulary scores were computed. Infants' exposure to each language and their exposure balance were measured using a language exposure questionnaire. Logistic curves were fitted to each infant's data to estimate the timing (midpoint) and steepness (slope) of the vocabulary spurt in single-language, concept, and word vocabularies. Seventy-six percent of infants showed a spurt in at least one vocabulary type, and bilinguals were less likely to show one in their nondominant than their dominant language. For single-language vocabulary, infants with more exposure to a language had earlier spurts. For combined vocabularies (concept and word), monolinguals and unbalanced bilinguals had earlier and steeper spurts than balanced bilinguals. Results better support the predictions of accumulator models than cognitive theories and show that infants follow different vocabulary acquisition trajectories based on their language background.<br />					Byers-Heinlein, Krista/C-4224-2011	Gomez Diaz, Miranda/0000-0003-1503-6893													0012-1649	1939-0599				AUG	2024	60	8					1357	1371		10.1037/dev0001777	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001777								38976425					WOS:001327912400005

We investigated sensitivity to advanced tongue root (ATR) harmony in Akan (Kwa, Niger-Congo) in 40 six-month-old multilingual infants (21 girls) in Ghana, West Africa (an understudied population), all learning Akan, Ghanaian English, and most of them several other understudied African languages (e.g., Ga, Ewe). We hypothesized that infants learning both ATR harmony and nonharmony languages would demonstrate sensitivity to ATR harmony. Using the central fixation procedure, infants were presented with disyllabic nonwords that were either harmonic (e.g., puti) or nonharmonic (e.g., pet(sic)) based on their ATR features. Infants demonstrated sensitivity to ATR harmony with a familiarity preference, listening longer to harmonic syllable sequences than nonharmonic ones. The relative amount of exposure to (an) ATR harmony language(s) did not modulate the preference. These results shed light on our understanding of early multilingualism: they suggest that early sensitivity to VH in multilinguals may be similar to monolingual infants learning other types of VH, irrespective of simultaneous experience with non-VH languages. We conclude with reflections on studying infant language acquisition in multilingual Africa.

Parasympathetic Regulation and Support From Family and Friends Predict Prosocial Development in US Mexican-Origin Adolescents	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Both parasympathetic nervous system regulation and receipt of social support from close relationships contribute to prosocial development, although few studies have examined their combined influences in adolescence and particularly within racially and ethnically minoritized populations. In this longitudinal study of 229 U.S. Mexican-origin adolescents (48% female-identifying), youths reported on receipt of social support from family and friends from 10 to 16 years, had their baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) measured at 17 years, reported their prosocial behavior and completed the Mind in the Eyes test to assess cognitive empathy at 17 and 19 years, and reported their prosocial civic behavior (i.e., community activity) at 19 years. Family social support predicted prosocial behavior at 17 years, and friend social support predicted prosocial civic behavior at 19 years. Compared to youths with lower or higher baseline RSA, youths with moderate RSA reported more prosocial civic behavior, had greater cognitive empathy, and tended to report more general prosocial behavior at 19 years. The quadratic association between baseline RSA and cognitive empathy was stronger for youths with greater family social support. These findings are the first to extend the evidence that moderate baseline parasympathetic nervous system activity supports prosocial development into late adolescence and with the U.S. Mexican-origin community, and these findings address calls for more integrative biopsychosocial studies of prosociality.

Using a three-wave longitudinal data set (5 years) of 604 adolescents, cumulative strengths (CS) was calculated, and growth curve analyses showed a similar pattern of findings for both transcultural and cultural cumulative strengths models: Adolescents with higher CS showed higher baseline resilience, life meaning, and discipline. While there were no significant associations between adolescents' CS scores and the increase in resilience, adolescents with higher CS scores showed steeper declines in life meaning and discipline (although these declines were no longer significant for cultural CS when transcultural and cultural CS were simultaneously tested in the same model). The findings emphasize a cultural ecological understanding of Mexican-origin youths' positive development from early to later adolescence. They also provide support for a CS model and have implications for positive psychology theories.

Developmental Paths From Parents' Bicultural Socialization Beliefs to Emerging Adult Depressive Symptoms in Chinese American Families	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Parents' socialization beliefs have implications for the psychological adjustment of their children through their parenting behaviors; however, such pathways have rarely been established among Chinese American families. The present study examined how Chinese American parents' goals for their children to take on bicultural values and behaviors (i.e., bicultural socialization beliefs) influenced their child's level of depressive symptoms in emerging adulthood through their parenting behaviors and the level of parent-child alienation. Data came from Waves 2 (adolescence) and 3 (emerging adulthood) of a longitudinal study of 444 Chinese American families. Mothers' reports of their bicultural socialization beliefs positively predicted adolescents' reports of mothers' autonomy-supporting behaviors and interdependence-focused shaming behaviors. In addition, there was a significant and negative indirect effect of mothers' bicultural socialization beliefs on emerging adult depressive symptoms through adolescents' reports of mothers' autonomy-supporting behaviors and emerging adults' reports of alienation to their parents. In contrast, there was a significant and positive indirect effect from fathers' reports of their bicultural socialization beliefs to emerging adult depressive symptoms, through emerging adults' reports of alienation only. Findings contribute to our understanding of bicultural processes in Chinese American families and establish that parents' beliefs have significant implications for the psychological adjustment of Chinese American youth.

J	Schroer, SE; Peters, RE; Yu, C				Schroer, Sara E.; Peters, Ryan E.; Yu, Chen			Consistency and Variability in Multimodal Parent-Child Social Interaction: An At-Home Study Using Head-Mounted Eye Trackers	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Real-time attention coordination in parent-toddler dyads is often studied in tightly controlled laboratory settings. These studies have demonstrated the importance of joint attention in scaffolding the development of attention and the types of dyadic behaviors that support early language learning. Little is known about how often these behaviors occur in toddlers' everyday lives. We brought wireless head-mounted eye trackers to families' homes to study the moment-to-moment patterns of toddlers' and parents' visual attention and manual activity in daily routines. Our sample consisted of English- and Spanish-speaking families who all reported being middle- or upper middle-class. Toddlers were 2 to 3 years old. Consistent with the findings from previous laboratory studies, we found variability in how frequently toddlers attended to named objects in two everyday activities-Object Play and Mealtime. We then tested whether parent-toddler joint attention in the seconds before a naming utterance increased toddler's attention on the named object. We found that joint attention accompanied by the attended object being held increased the child's attention to the labeled object during naming. We posit that in the rich, noisy world of toddlers' everyday lives, embodied attention plays a critical role in coordinating dyadic behaviors and creating informative naming moments. Our findings highlight the importance of studying toddlers' natural behavior in the real world.

However, labor-intensive data collection and processing limit the speed at which this understanding can be advanced. Here, we demonstrate an asynchronous workflow for conducting violation-of-expectation (VoE) experiments, which is fully "hands-off" for the experimenter. We first replicate four classic VoE experiments in a synchronous online setting, and show that VoE can generate highly replicable effects through remote testing. We then confirm the accuracy of a state-of-the-art gaze annotation software, iCatcher+ in a new setting. Third, we train parents to control the experiment flow based on the infant's gaze. Combining all three innovations, we then conduct an asynchronous automated infant-contingent VoE experiment. The hands-off workflow successfully replicates a classic VoE effect: infants look longer at inefficient actions than efficient ones. We compare the resulting effect size and statistical power to the same study run in-lab and synchronously via Zoom. The hands-off workflow significantly reduces the marginal cost and time per participant, enabling larger sample sizes. By enhancing the reproducibility and robustness of findings relying on infant looking, this workflow could help support a cumulative science of infant cognition. Tools to implement the workflow are openly available.

J	Ji, Y; Papafragou, A				Ji, Yue; Papafragou, Anna			Boundedness Supports Children's Event Representations	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Natural languages distinguish between telic predicates that denote events leading to an inherent endpoint (e.g., draw a balloon) and atelic predicates that denote events with no inherent endpoint (e.g., draw balloons). Telicity distinctions in many languages are already partly available to 4-5-year-olds. Here, using exclusively nonlinguistic tasks and a sample of English-speaking children, we ask whether young learners use corresponding temporal notions to characterize event structure-that is, whether children represent events in cognition as bounded temporal entities with a specified endpoint or unbounded temporal units that could in principle extend indefinitely. We find that 4-5-year-old children in our sample compute boundedness during an event categorization task (Experiment 1) and distinguish event boundedness from event completion (Experiment 2). Furthermore, 4-5-year-olds in our sample evaluate interruptions at event endpoints versus midpoints differently-but only for events that are construed as bounded, presumably because in such construals, events truly culminate (Experiment 3). We conclude that young children represent events in terms of foundational and abstract temporal properties. These properties could support the acquisition of linguistic aspectual distinctions and further scaffold the way children conceptualize and process their dynamic experiences.

Benjamin; Erath, Stephen A.; El-Sheikh, Mona			The Legacy of Harsh Parenting: Enduring and Sleeper Effects on Trajectories of Externalizing and Internalizing Symptoms	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Guided by developmental models examining the legacy of childhood caregiving environments, we examined the longitudinal pattern of associations between harsh parenting and children's internalizing and externalizing symptoms across late childhood to late adolescence. Participants included 199 youth (48.7% female, 65.3% White, 32.2% Black, 2.5% biracial) and their mothers and fathers from a diverse range of socioeconomic backgrounds. The study utilized a multi-informant, longitudinal design including five waves of data (youths' mean ages were 9, 10, 11, 17, and 18 across waves). Harsh parenting at Age 9 predicted higher levels of (a) externalizing symptoms at Ages 11, 17, and 18 and (b) internalizing symptoms at Ages 17 and 18. Developmental sensitivity analyses revealed that the magnitude of the more distal association between early harsh parenting and later internalizing and externalizing symptoms was statistically stronger as compared to more proximal associations. Bidirectional analyses revealed that externalizing symptoms at Age 9 predicted harsh parenting at Ages 9, 10, 11, 17, and 18. Whereas links between harsh parenting and internalizing symptoms were consistent with a sleeper effects model, links between harsh parenting and externalizing symptoms provided some support for both enduring and sleeper effects models. Findings inform an understanding of youth developmental sensitivity to harsh parenting and the downstream consequences of harsh parenting. Results have important translational implications, including testing the long-term efficacy of therapeutic programs.

J	Do, KT; Telzer, EH				Do, Kathy T.; Telzer, Eva H.			Longitudinal Changes in the Value and Influence of Parent and Peer Attitudes About Externalizing Behaviors Across Adolescence	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This preregistered, longitudinal study examined how much adolescents value and integrate their parents' and peers' attitudes into their own attitudes from early to middle adolescence. Across three waves, participants (N = 172, 91 female, 11-16 years across three waves; 439 data points) decided whether to pay money to learn their parents' or peers' attitudes about externalizing behaviors. Multivariate growth models revealed that adolescents were consistently willing to pay money over time to learn their parents' and peers' attitudes. The value of learning peers'-but not parents'-attitudes predicted changes in personal attitudes during adolescence, and this did not change across age. Moreover, the effect of others' attitude value on social influence weakened from early to middle adolescence, such that early adolescents who highly valued learning the attitudes of others (i.e., paid more) tended to shift their own attitudes more toward those endorsing positive influence, regardless of the source. In contrast, early adolescents who valued learning others' attitudes less were less susceptible to positive social influence. Importantly, this effect went away in middle adolescence. Although adolescents are highly motivated to learn their parents' and peers' attitudes about externalizing behaviors, how much those attitudes inform their personal attitudes depends on the source of input and the age of adolescents.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				AUG	2024	60	8					1500	1510		10.1037/dev0001715	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001715								38483483					WOS:001327912400010

Association Between Developmental Patterns of Single and Concurrent Externalizing Behaviors and Internalizing Problems Over the Preschool Years	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The present study investigated whether distinct developmental patterns of externalizing behaviors (EBs: hyperactivity-impulsivity, noncompliance, physical aggression) based on parent reports were repeatedly and differentially associated with separate dimensions of internalizing problems such as general anxiety, separation anxiety, and depressive symptoms across the early, middle, and late preschool years in a population birth cohort (N = 2,057, 50.7% boys). Six high trajectory classes obtained by latent growth modeling were used as longitudinal indicators of single EB and co-occurrent EBs. Children following low or moderate trajectories for all EBs served as the reference class. Results revealed that children in trajectory classes reflecting high levels of co-occurring EBs showed higher levels of general anxiety, separation anxiety, and depressive symptoms across the preschool years. In contrast, children in trajectory classes reflecting single EB manifested higher levels of some, but not all, dimensions of internalizing problems. In addition, their scores varied from one period to another. No sex differences were observed in the above associations. These results underline the need for comprehensive assessments across distinct types of EBs and internalizing problems to better reflect the characteristics that distinguish individual children. Finally, results suggest that children showing early co-occurrent EBs and internalizing symptoms may be an important group to target for in-depth assessment and possibly preventive intervention.

Longitudinal Relations Among Temperament, Cognitive Control, and Anxiety: From Toddlerhood to Late Adolescence	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Children with a history of behaviorally inhibited (BI) temperament face a heightened risk for anxiety disorders and often use control strategies that are less planful. Although these relations have been observed concurrently in early childhood, middle childhood, and adolescence, few studies leverage longitudinal data to examine long-term prospective relations between cognitive control and anxiety. Using longitudinal data from 149 adolescents (55% female; from predominantly White middle-class families), we assessed temperament in toddlerhood and cognitive control and anxiety at 4, 12, 15, and 18 years of age. At age 4, separate measures of task switching and inhibitory control were obtained via the Dimensional Change Card Sort and Stroop tasks, respectively. At 12, 15, and 18 years of age, planful control was assessed with the AX-Continuous Performance Test, and anxiety symptoms were assessed via self-report. Growth curve models revealed that children with greater inhibitory control at age 4, regardless of BI status, experienced a sharper increase in anxiety symptoms across adolescence. Children with heightened BI during early childhood displayed lower levels of planful control at age 12, but experienced a more rapid improvement in these skills across adolescence. Children with greater task switching ability at age 4 displayed higher levels of planful control at age 12, but experienced a smaller increase in these skills across adolescence. Finally, children's growth rate for anxiety was unrelated to their growth rate for planful control. These findings reveal that early-life temperament, cognitive control, and anxiety remain interconnected across development, from toddlerhood to at least late adolescence.

The Promise of an Identity-Based Self-Affirmation Intervention in Protecting Against Self-Esteem Declines at the High School Transition	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Given the importance of self-esteem for promoting adolescents' social, psychological, and academic adjustment and the growing importance of social identities during adolescence, this five-wave study examined whether an identity-based self-affirmation intervention attenuated declines in adolescent self-esteem following the high school transition. A sample of ninth graders in the United States (N = 388; M-age = 14.05; 60.6% female; 35.8% male; 3.6% nonbinary, trans, or identifying with another gender; 46% White, 19% Black, 17% Asian, 6% Arab, Middle Eastern, North African, 6% Biracial/Multiethnic, 3% Latinx/Hispanic, and 3% another race/ethnicity) was recruited for the study. Following completion of a baseline online survey assessing self-esteem, participants were assigned to one of three conditions and corresponding writing exercises: identity-based self-affirmation, values-based self-affirmation, or control. Participants completed the same writing exercise during the first three waves of the study, and they completed measures of self-esteem at all five waves. Results indicated that participants in the self-affirmation conditions, but not the control condition, were protected from declining self-esteem across 1 year.

Trajectories of Emotional Disclosure With Parents During the College Transition Among Asian First-Year Students	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The college transition is a time of great emotional lability, and sharing emotional experiences with parents can be beneficial for first-year students. Guided by the social sharing of emotions framework and the cultural theory on self-construal, this study investigated the developmental course of freshmen's emotional disclosure with parents during the first semester and the mediating role of independence-orientation in two Asian contexts-Beijing (China) and Singapore. Using experience sampling method (online diary), 205 Chinese freshmen (M-age = 19.43) and 291 Singapore freshmen (M-age = 19.44) reported on four facets of emotional disclosure with parents (frequency, intimacy, negativity, and positivity) across four timepoints and their independence-interdependence orientation (Time 1). Latent growth curve modeling comparing the two Asian samples revealed that frequency increased for Chinese students and decreased for Singapore students. Intimacy indicated upward trajectories for both Asian samples, whereas negativity and positivity showed downward trajectories but were less pronounced for Chinese students. Mediated latent growth curve modeling revealed that the cultures predicted independence-orientation, which in turn negatively predicted increase in frequency for the Singapore sample and positively predicted decrease for the Chinese sample. Independence-orientation negatively predicted increase in intimacy, positively predicted decline in negativity, and negatively predicted decline in positivity. In sum, we found complex and differentiated trajectories for the four facets of emotional disclosure in two Asian samples and the mediating role of independence-orientation in explaining cultural differences in the trajectories, which have implications for understanding emotional disclosure to parents during the developmental phase of the college transition in Asian contexts.

J	Chen, FR; Sutton, AL				Chen, Frances R.; Sutton, Amanda L.			The Reciprocal Relationships Between Moral Disengagement and Antisocial Behavior From Ages 16 to 23	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Moral disengagement (MD) has been consistently associated with antisocial behavior (ASB) in prior research. Limited research tested the directionality of the bivariate relationship, and most studies focused only on the direction of MD predicting ASB, even though ASB could also influence MD based on the literature on attribution and behavioral influence on attitude. Moreover, the few studies testing reciprocal associations rarely controlled for stable individual differences and did not explicitly examine the age effect to allow for a clear developmental inference. We analyzed age-based self-report antisocial behavior and moral disengagement data across ages 16-23 from 1,349 juvenile offenders (86.43% male; 20.31% White, 41.29% Black, 33.65% Hispanic) in the Pathways to Desistance Project using a random intercept cross-lagged panel model. Controlling for stable individual differences in MD and ASB and their associations along with the autoregressive effects, there was a reciprocal relationship between MD and ASB from ages 16 to 18. However, from ages 19 to 21, only ASB significantly predicted MD in the following year. There was no significant cross-lagged effect from ages 21 to 23. Our findings highlight the dynamic relationship between MD and ASB from ages 16 to 23. Youth between 16 and 18 years old may be more pliable to change with treatment/intervention due to the two-way traffic of cognition and behavior, but we also caution against treatment efforts with a heavy focus on proactive criminal thinking involving moral disengagement to reduce offending behavior beyond age 18. Public Significance Statement The mutual influences of MD and ASB from age 16 to 18 suggest that youth at these ages are more pliable to change, and the two-way traffic in their cognition and behavior may be opportune for intervention to start a positive feedback loop. Because of the lack of effect of MD on ASB beyond age 18, we caution against treatment efforts with a heavy focus on proactive criminal thinking (e.g., moral disengagement) to reduce offending behavior.

The analytic sample comprises adolescents in the school context (T1 N = 678, T2 N = 563, and T3 N = 471) and in organized free-time activity contexts (T1 n = 443, T2 n = 400, and T3 n = 356). Our findings suggest that adolescents with experiences of sexual harassment victimization in Grade 7 were at an increased risk of being sexually revictimized the following 2 years across the two distinct developmental contexts. Further, our results reveal that adolescents are more sexually harassed by their peers in organized activity contexts both concurrently and over time if they were victims of sexual harassment in the school context and the other way around. The findings underscore the need for sexual harassment prevention interventions to consider different developmental contexts simultaneously and to focus on the history of adolescents' experiences of victimization.

Children's Recognition of Causal System Categories Across Superficially Distinct Events	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												A deep understanding of any phenomenon requires knowing how its causal elements are related to one another. Here, we examine whether children treat causal structure as a metric for assessing similarity across superficially distinct events. In two experiments, we presented 156 4-7-year-olds (approximately 55% of participants identified as White, 29% as multiracial, and 12% as Asian) with three-variable narratives in which story events unfold according to a causal chain or a common effect structure. We then asked children to make judgments about which stories are the most similar. In Experiment 1, we presented all events in the context of simple, illustrated stories. In Experiment 2, we removed all low-level linguistic cues that may have supported children's similarity judgments in Experiment 1 and used animated videos to support understanding of the causal elements in each story. Results indicated a gradual shift between 4 and 7 years in children's use of causal structure as a metric of similarity between narratives: While we found that children as young as five were capable of correctly representing the causal structure of each story individually, only 6- and 7-year-olds relied on shared causal structure across stories when making similarity judgments. We discuss these findings in light of children's developing causal and abstract reasoning and propose directions for future work.

J	Jambon, M; Colasante, T; Malti, T				Jambon, Marc; Colasante, Tyler; Malti, Tina			Machiavellian Behavior and Social-Emotional Functioning in Middle Childhood and Early Adolescence	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Machiavellianism is an antisocial interpersonal style involving the use of manipulative, deceptive, and coercive behaviors in the pursuit of self-interest. Although widely studied as a "dark" personality trait in adults, relatively little is known about the developmental correlates of Machiavellian tendencies earlier in life. The present study addressed this knowledge gap by examining associations between Machiavellian behavior and three theoretically relevant social-emotional domains-prosocial emotions, emotion recognition skills, and self-control-in a community sample of 7- and 11-year-old Canadian children (N = 300, 50% female). Of particular interest was the extent to which individual differences in social-emotional capacities were uniquely associated with Machiavellian behavior after controlling for aggression, a relatively well-studied antisocial behavior in childhood. Parents reported on children's Machiavellian behavior and aggression. Social-emotional correlates were assessed via parent and child reports, behavioral tasks, and physiological assessments. Machiavellian behavior and aggression were similarly associated with lower parent-reported prosocial emotions and self-control. Machiavellian (but not aggressive) behavior was associated with lower child-reported guilt (a prosocial emotion), higher resting skin conductance levels (reflecting a general tendency for higher arousal), and better anger recognition. Semipartial correlational analyses indicated that these patterns of association with Machiavellian behaviors held independent of aggression. These findings indicate that, by middle childhood, Machiavellian behavior constitutes a distinct form of antisocial conduct that is associated with a unique social-emotional risk profile.

Can Behaviorally Inhibited Preschoolers Make Friends?	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Preschoolers who display extremely inhibited behavior are at risk for the development of anxiety disorders. However, behavioral inhibition (BI) is a multifaceted characteristic. Some children with BI are fearful when confronted by unfamiliar adults, peers, and objects; others are fearful when separated from their parents. In the present study, we examined specific features of BI that predicted observed friendship formation among preschoolers who are behaviorally inhibited. We also examined whether teacher ratings of classroom behaviors predicted friendship formation. Sixty highly inhibited children (35 female, M-age = 52.57 months) were observed during eight weekly free-play sessions with initially unfamiliar inhibited peers. Free-play periods occurred before weekly intervention sessions for children with BI and their parents. An observational protocol was developed to identify children who made a friend during the eight weekly sessions. Before the first session, different subtypes of BI were assessed by parents; preschool teachers assessed the children's classroom behaviors with familiar peers. Twenty-six children met the criteria for having made and kept a friend. Probit regression analyses revealed that parent ratings of BI among unfamiliar peers and teacher ratings of children's social anxiety before the intervention were associated with a decreased probability of making a friend. No evidence was found linking children's responses to the intervention and friendship formation. Results suggest that extremelyinhibited preschoolers are capable of making friends. Implications for future research and intervention efforts that focus on individual differences of children with BI are discussed.

Hostile Interparental Conflict and Parental Discipline: Romantic Attachment as a Spillover Mechanism	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examined parental romantic attachment security as a mediator of prospective associations between hostile interparental conflict and parental discipline (i.e., power-assertive, permissive, and inductive discipline) for mothers and fathers of young children. Furthermore, this study utilized a novel, automatic assessment of romantic attachment security in examining whether romantic attachment assessed at controlled (i.e., self-reported) and automatic (i.e., a rapid word-sorting task) levels of representation differentially serve as spillover mechanisms. Participants included 235 mothers (62% White), fathers (55% White), and a target child between the ages of 2 and 4 (M-age = 2.97; 55% girls) recruited from a moderate-sized metropolitan area in the Northeastern United States. Families were assessed annually across three waves of data collection. Results from autoregressive structural equation model analyses revealed that romantic attachment operated as spillover mechanism for mothers. In particular, hostile interparental conflict was associated with power-assertive discipline through changes in mothers' automatic romantic attachment security. We also found that hostile interparental conflict was associated with inductive discipline through changes in mothers' romantic attachment avoidance. Neither controlled nor automatic romantic attachment representations served as spillover mechanisms for fathers. Findings are discussed within family systems and attachment frameworks.

J	Corbit, J; MacDougall, H; Hartlin, S; Moore, C				Corbit, John; MacDougall, Hayley; Hartlin, Stephanie; Moore, Chris			The Role of Affiliation in the Development of Collaborative Partner Choice	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Collaboration is an early emerging component of successful cooperative relations that produces a cascade of positive social preferences between collaborators. Concurrently, robust preferences for affiliated others may restrict these benefits to in-group peers. We investigated how in-group affiliation (based on minimal group markers) and interpersonal affiliation (based on shared preferences) influence children's collaborative partner choice. We asked whether children prefer to collaborate with affiliated peers and if highlighting interpersonal affiliation with out-group members reduce in-group bias in partner choice. In Study 1, we assigned children (4-9 years, N = 124, 62 female, two nonbinary) to either a group or interpersonal affiliation condition and gave them a choice of collaborating with either an affiliated (in-group or same preference) or unaffiliated (out-group or different preference) peer. While children preferred affiliated peers in both conditions, interpersonal affiliation had a greater influence than group affiliation on collaborative partner choice among younger participants. With age, the difference between children's preference for affiliated peers in the interpersonal and group affiliation condition declined until they were similar in middle childhood. In Study 2, we assessed whether shared preferences would override in-group bias when these factors were directly contrasted. Children (4-9 years, N = 62, 33 female) chose between an in-group/different preference or out-group/same preferences peer. Younger children preferred the out-group/same preference peer, a preference that diminished with age to chance levels in middle childhood. These findings suggest that affiliation is an important determinant of collaborative partner choice and that shared preferences can override in-group bias in children's collaborative partner choice.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				JUL	2024	60	7					1227	1236		10.1037/dev0001739	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001739								38546569					WOS:001327884700008
J	Gardier, M; Geurten, M				Gardier, Marion; Geurten, Marie			The Developmental Path of Metacognition From Toddlerhood to Early Childhood and Its Influence on Later Memory Performance	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Recently, several studies have suggested that metacognition emerges early in infancy and toddlerhood. However, to date, the developmental trajectory of these early metacognitive monitoring and control processes and their influence on children's later memory functioning remains poorly understood. The aim of this study was to longitudinally document the development of metacognition between the ages of 2.5 and 4.5 years and to examine the link between these early metacognitive skills and later memory performance. To do so, 69 children initially aged 29-33 months old (N-T0 = 69; 32 females; M-age = 32.3 months; SD = 1.6) were tested at three time points (12-month intervals) with a recognition memory paradigm designed to assess both metacognitive monitoring, through retrospective confidence judgment, and metacognitive control, through a cue selection task (i.e., children had the opportunity to ask for a cue to help them change their memory decision). In addition, at the last session, an episodic memory task (story recall) was also administered. Our results revealed an improvement in monitoring and control processes between 2.5 and 4.5 years with above-chance performance from around age 3.5. Mixed-effects modeling also indicated that metacognitive monitoring at ages 2.5 and 4.5, but not-unexpectedly-metacognitive control, was related to children's memory performance at age 4.5. Overall, our results provide evidence to enhance our understanding of the developmental course of metacognition from toddlerhood to early childhood and suggest that metacognitive processes are involved in memory performance much earlier than had previously been shown.

The Effect of Peers' Theory of Mind on Children's Own Theory of Mind Development: A Longitudinal Study in Middle Childhood and Early Adolescence	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												While there is considerable evidence that children's early ability to understand others' mental states, called "theory of mind," is shaped by family experiences, it remains unclear whether children's social interactions at school influence theory of mind (ToM) beyond early childhood. We tested whether the mean level ("quantity") and/or the diversity ("variety") of peers' ToM influenced children's own ToM. We also examined whether peer effects on ToM were independent of possible confounding variables (e.g., verbal ability, social isolation) and comparable across children with different initial levels of ToM and social status. Four hundred fifty-four 8-12-year-old children completed assessments of ToM and peer and friendship nominations at baseline and (for ToM only) 1 year later. The variety (but not the quantity) of peers' ToM predicted the development of children's ToM over and above control variables. The magnitude of the peer effect was comparable across different levels of children's ToM and between children indexed as socially isolated and those who were not. These findings fit with sociocultural models and highlight the importance of the school environment in the development of ToM.

Educational Experiences of US Children During the 2020-2021 School Year in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a historic event impacting children around the globe. Prior research on the educational experiences of children during the COVID-19 pandemic focused almost exclusively on spring 2020. This article extends this literature past the initial shock of spring 2020, capturing the first full school year (2020-2021) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This registered report study utilized a national sample of 1,666 United States twins in kindergarten through 12th grade from 43 states to provide the current descriptive report of children's educational experiences during this time, as reported by their parents. Specifically, we reported on school format, parents' role in education, parent-teacher interactions, schoolwork struggles, technology access, and school services. About half of children attended in-person schooling, with many children switching from online to in-person throughout the school year. Parents saw the pandemic as a risk to their children's education. During the 2020-2021 school year of the pandemic, parents felt they had a larger role in their children's education and were less satisfied in their interactions with teachers than what they experienced during the prepandemic part of the 2019-2020 school year. Children experienced more schoolwork struggles than they had in previous years, and this was similar across age groups. For most constructs, results were equivalent across age group, but parents of younger children tended to provide more schoolwork help. Overall, this article highlights the disruptions in their educational environments that children continued to experience through the first full school year (2020-2021) of the COVID-19 pandemic.

J	Bleijlevens, N; Behne, T				Bleijlevens, Natalie; Behne, Tanya			Young Children and Adults Use Reasoning by Exclusion Rather Than Attraction to Novelty to Disambiguate Novel Word Meanings	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Upon hearing a novel label, listeners tend to assume that it refers to a novel, rather than a familiar object. While this disambiguation or mutual exclusivity (ME) effect has been robustly shown across development, it is unclear what it involves. Do listeners use their pragmatic and lexical knowledge to exclude the familiar object and thus select the novel one? Or is the effect, at least in early childhood, simply based on an attraction to novelty and a direct mapping of the novel label to a novel object? In a preregistered online study with 2- to 3-year-olds (n = 75) and adults (n = 112), we examined (a) whether relative object novelty alone (without pragmatic or lexical information) could account for participants' disambiguation and (b) whether participants' decision processes involved reasoning by exclusion. Participants encountered either a known and an unknown object (classic ME condition) or two unknown objects, one completely novel and one preexposed (novelty condition) as potential referents of a novel label. Reasoning by exclusion was assessed by children's looking patterns and adults' explanations. In the classic ME condition, children and adults significantly chose the novel object and both used reasoning by exclusion. In contrast, in the novelty condition, children and adults chose randomly. Across conditions, a retention test revealed that adults remembered their prior selections, while children's performance was fragile. These results suggest that referent disambiguation is not based on relative object novelty alone. Instead, to resolve referential ambiguity, both young children and adults seem to make use of pragmatic and/or lexical sources of information and to engage in reasoning by exclusion strategies.

J	Deacon, SH; Mimeau, C; Levesque, K; Ricketts, J				Deacon, S. Helene; Mimeau, Catherine; Levesque, Kyle; Ricketts, Jessie			Testing Mechanisms Underlying Children's Reading Development: The Power of Learning Lexical Representations	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Prominent theories of reading development have separately emphasized the relevance of children's skill in learning (Share, 2008) and lexical representations (Perfetti & Hart, 2002). Integrating these ideas, we examined whether skill in learning lexical representations is a mechanism that might explain children's reading development. To do so we conducted a longitudinal study, following 139 children from Grades 3 to 5. In Grade 3, children completed measures of word reading and reading comprehension and again at Grade 5. In Grade 4, children read short stories containing novel words; they were later tested on their memory for the spellings and meanings of these new words, capturing orthographic and semantic learning, respectively. Using multiple-mediation path analysis, we tested whether children's skill in learning orthographic and semantic dimensions of new words was a mediator of individual differences in each of word reading and reading comprehension. In models controlling for nonverbal ability, working memory, vocabulary, and phonological awareness, we found two clear effects: individual differences in orthographic learning at Grade 4 mediated the gains that children made in word reading between Grades 3 and 5 and individual differences in semantic learning at Grade 4 mediated gains in reading comprehension over the same time period. These findings suggest that children's ability to learn lexical representations is a mechanism in reading development, with orthographic effects on word reading and semantic effects on reading comprehension. These findings show the power and the specificity of children's capacity to learn in determining their progress in learning to read.						Deacon, S.

However, much remains unknown about the interplay among these abilities when facing various challenging situations. Additionally, the role of these abilities in child SEF has not yet been studied among minority children from an Eastern culture. Thus, we conducted one study with two models to examine the combined contribution of these core abilities, concurrently, to children's SEF during the transition to kindergarten, and longitudinally (about 3 years later) to children's SEF during COVID-19. Overall, 202 kindergarten children (aged 4.9-6.5 years) participated, of which 136 of them in the longitudinal follow-up (aged 8.83-10.6 years). We used behavioral tasks and teacher and maternal reports. Mothers also reported their own distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the transition to kindergarten, we found that emotion-related SR was positively related to children's SEF. We also found that emotion-related SR moderated the relation between inhibition and ToM. In the follow-up study, we found that emotion-related SR in kindergarten significantly predicted children's SEF during the COVID-19 crisis, directly and indirectly, through children's SEF in kindergarten and their maternal COVID-related distress. Moreover, emotion-related SR moderated the longitudinal association between children's ToM at kindergarten age and their SEF during the COVID-19 crisis. Our findings highlight the central role that emotion-related SR plays in children's ability to face different challenges.

J	Pawsey, H; Denison, S; Friedman, O				Pawsey, Hailey; Denison, Stephanie; Friedman, Ori			Children Use Proximity and Ability to Infer Distinct Kinds of Counterfactual Closeness	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Counterfactual outcomes (i.e., events that did not happen) vary in their closeness to reality. Whereas some are viewed as distant possibilities, others are seen as close, barely unrealized outcomes. Here, we investigate whether young children distinguish between two kinds of counterfactual closeness: one based on proximity and the other on ability. In two experiments, 4-7-year-olds (total N = 304) saw stories where two agents lost a race against a competitor. One of the losing racers finished just behind the winner (proximity), whereas the other losing racer was much faster than the winner (ability) but lost after tripping on a stone. When asked which racer almost won the race, children across the full age range predominantly picked the racer who finished in second place, close behind the winner. However, when asked which racer easily could have won and when asked which racer should have won, children at older ages picked the fastest racer. Together, these findings show that children's understanding of proximity-based closeness is already present at Age 4, earlier than children were previously thought to grasp counterfactual closeness. Moreover, the findings suggest young children have differentiated concepts of counterfactual closeness and do not conflate the two kinds of closeness. Public Significance Statement People often dwell on close counterfactuals-alternatives to reality that did not happen but feel like they were close to happening. Until recently, counterfactual closeness was principally seen as depending on propensity, the sense of events building toward an outcome. We show that from early in development, children use two other cues to infer counterfactual closeness. Specifically, children also infer closeness from proximity and ability and see these two cues as supporting distinct kinds of closeness. These findings suggest that young children recognize that outcomes that seem close to having happened can seem this way for differing reasons.

Participants were 85 three-year-old children (54% female) and their mothers oversampled for lower income, higher stressful life events, and higher child maltreatment risk. Child behavioral regulation, assessed as compliance and noncompliance, and maternal supportive parenting were observed during a challenging dyadic puzzle task. Results showed that child RSA exhibited quadratic change across the task on average, characterized by an expected initial decrease and subsequent recovery. Child behavioral regulation and its interaction with maternal supportive parenting were associated with interindividual differences in child RSA reactivity trajectories after controlling for child resting RSA. Children with higher compliance or lower noncompliance showed RSA decreases in response to task stressors but exhibited subsequent RSA recovery only when mothers displayed higher supportive parenting. Children with lower compliance or higher noncompliance displayed negligible RSA changes overall across the task, suggesting blunted or compromised RSA reactivity, regardless of supportive parenting levels. These findings demonstrate novel evidence that preschoolers' better behavioral regulation is related to their more adaptive physiological reactivity to stressors and that supportive parenting is needed to facilitate physiological recovery even in relatively better-regulated preschoolers.

Does Inducing Growth-Oriented Mindsets About Math Ability in Parents Enhance Children's Math Mindsets, Affect, and Achievement?	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												A parent-directed intervention designed to foster growth-oriented mindsets about math was evaluated in a longitudinal randomized-control trial. Parents (N = 615; 61% White, 22% Black; 63% with at least a bachelor's degree) participated in the intervention or an active control condition in which they learned about the Common Core math curriculum. Parents reported on their math mindsets and parenting practices (e.g., autonomy-supportive math homework assistance) over 15-18 months; their young elementary school children's (M-age = 7.17 years; 50% girls) math adjustment (e.g., mindsets and achievement) was also assessed. The intervention (vs. control) led to sustained increases in parents' beliefs that math ability is malleable and math failure is beneficial for learning. The intervention, however, did not improve their math parenting practices or children's math adjustment relative to the control. Instead, there were generally improvements in math parenting practices and children's math adjustment over the course of the study regardless of condition, perhaps because the control condition provided parents with useful information about the Common Core math curriculum. Overall, the findings indicate that although the mindset intervention was effective in instilling stronger growth-oriented mindsets about math in parents, this did not translate into benefits for children's math learning over and above the active control condition.

DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Previous research suggests that the use of emotion labels helps children to learn about emotions. However, the mechanism behind this relation remains somewhat elusive. The present study examined 3-year-old children's (N = 72; M-age = 3.51 years; 42 female) ability to match faces to emotional vignettes, and the role that the use of emotion labels plays in this process. Parents identified participating children as White (N = 37), multiracial (N = 17), African American/Black (N = 5), Asian (N = 5), Hispanic (N = 3), Latino (N = 2), South Asian/Indian (N = 1), Middle Eastern (N = 1), and other (N = 1), and most children had a parent with a college degree (N = 66). After a pretest, children heard either explicit emotion labels ("she feels annoyed"), novel labels ("she feels wuggy"), or irrelevant information ("she sits down") paired with a vignette and associated facial configuration. Children were then tested again at posttest for evidence of learning. Results revealed that children only improved from pre- to posttest in the explicit label condition, demonstrating that explicit emotion labels, which are likely to be familiar to children, facilitate children's learning of emotion information. Altogether, our results suggest that familiarity with emotion words from prior daily experience may best explain how emotion words influence children's learning about emotions.

How Relations Between Early Reading Skills and Third-Grade Mathematics Outcomes Vary Across Distribution: A Quantile Regression Approach	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Early reading skills are critical for later academic outcomes, which include mathematics. Yet, these relations may vary by a child's ability level. This study examined how early reading skills relate to different levels of third-grade mathematics. The samples included 105 same-sex twin pairs (210 individuals, 57% female, 43% male) from the ongoing longitudinal Western Reserve Reading and Math Projects, assessed at kindergarten (M = 6.18, SD = 0.44) and third grade (M = 9.07, SD = 0.49). Kindergarten reading measures consisted of the Letter Identification task from the Woodcock Reading Mastery Test-Revised Normative Update, the Deletion subtests from Phonological Awareness Test, and the Letter Naming Fluency task from the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills; third-grade math measures included Calculation, Fluency, Applied Problem, and Quantitative Concepts subtests of Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of Achievement. Both linear and quantile regressions were conducted using reading measures as predictors and math measures as the dependent variables. Linear regressions indicated that the Deletion Summary Score was a unique predictor of Applied Problems, and Letter Naming Fluency was a significant and unique predictor of Calculation Fluency and Quantitative Concepts. Quantile regressions provided a more thorough analysis of these relations.

We tested factors that shape infants' spontaneous locomotion by observing forty 12- to 22-month-olds (19 girls, 21 boys) during free play. Infants were recruited from the New York City area, and caregivers reported that 25 infants were White, six were Asian, four were Black, and five had multiple races; four were Hispanic or Latino. All infants played in four conditions: two environmental conditions (gross-motor toys, fine-motor toys) crossed with two social conditions (alone, together with a caregiver). Infants moved more in the gross-motor toy conditions than in the fine-motor toy conditions. However, the effect of playing with a caregiver differed by toy condition. In the gross-motor toy conditions, playing with a caregiver did not affect how much infants moved, but in the fine-motor toy conditions, playing with a caregiver further depressed infant locomotion. Infants with more walking experience moved more with gross-motor toys but not with fine-motor toys. Differences in the amount of locomotion between conditions were related to how infants used toys and the interactions between infants and caregivers.

J	Weisbecker, RL; DiLalla, LF				Weisbecker, Rachel L.; DiLalla, Lisabeth Fisher			Parent Versus Child Influences on Differential Parent Warmth and Discipline Within Twin Pairs	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Parenting behaviors have long been recognized as crucial to children's healthy development. However, examinations of the etiology of these behaviors are less prevalent. The current study investigated the driving forces behind parental warmth and discipline, particularly whether they are related more to traits within the parent or reactions to characteristics of the child. To explore this question, three robust factors of child temperament-effortful control, negative affectivity, and surgency/extraversion-and five parent personality traits were examined in association with parent behaviors through differential parenting within 185 four-year-old twin pairs (370 children; 56% girls; 90% White; predominantly middle class). Genetic analyses showed that parents tend to treat both children similarly in terms of parental warmth, but they treat children less similarly in terms of discipline, regardless of child zygosity. Multilevel linear regressions showed that within twin pairs, the child with higher effortful control received less discipline from parents than their cotwin. Analyses also showed that parent agreeableness was significantly related to parent warmth above and beyond other personality traits and child temperament. This study clarified the direction of effects and genetic contributions to parenting behaviors, supporting previous literature that discipline acts in reaction to the child, whereas warmth is more driven by parent personality. This research suggests the importance of focusing on child temperament and parent personality as they relate to parenting behaviors, allowing clinicians and parents to more effectively correct maladaptive parenting behaviors and encourage healthy and adaptive parenting behaviors, thus promoting positive outcomes for children.

A Process Model of Parental Executive Functioning as a Spillover Mechanism Linking Interparental Conflict and Parenting Difficulties Across Parenting Domains	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												There is a well-documented interdependency between destructive interparental conflict (IPC) and parenting difficulties (i.e., spillover effect), yet little is known about the mechanisms that "carry" spillover between IPC and parenting. Guided by a cascade model framework, the current study used a longitudinal, multimethod, multi-informant design to examine a process model of spillover that tested whether parental executive functioning (working memory, cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control) served as a mediator of the prospective associations between IPC and subsequent changes in parenting over a 2-year period. Mothers and fathers were separated into differentiated models and multiple domains of parenting were examined (i.e., authoritarian discipline and scaffolding behavior). Participants included 231 families (both mothers and fathers of preschoolers). Race was reported as White (62%), Black (21%), Mixed (8%), Asian (3%), or Other (6%) and 14% considered their ethnicity to be Hispanic/Latino. Median household income was $65,000. Results indicated that for fathers, IPC indirectly predicted domain-general parenting difficulties (increased authoritarian parenting and decreased scaffolding) via deficits in paternal cognitive flexibility (but not inhibitory control or working memory). In mothers, IPC directly predicted domain-specific parenting difficulties (decreased scaffolding only) that did not operate via maternal executive functions. Notably, these effects occurred over and above the influence of parental socioeconomic status. This study constitutes a first step toward documenting parental executive functioning as a mechanism underlying the spillover of IPC to the parent-child relationship. Family interventions intended to interrupt IPC spillover should emphasize father involvement and consider targeting parental executive functions as change mechanisms.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				JUN	2024	60	6					1052	1065		10.1037/dev0001743	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001743								38647472					WOS:001327348000011

Hong Kong and Canadian Children's Reasoning About Moral Judgments of Peers' Gendered Behaviors	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Children show less positivity toward gender-nonconforming (GN) than gender-conforming (GC) peers. Yet, little is known about children's reasoning about peers of varying gender expressions, including age-, gender-, and culture-related influences. We investigated how children aged 4- to 5- and 8- to 9-years-old in Hong Kong and Canada (N = 678) reason about their moral judgments of GC and GN peers. After viewing vignettes describing GC and GN boys and girls, we asked children whether each target peer's behavior was right or wrong and why they thought so. We coded children's reasoning using a new coding scheme developed via inductive content analysis. Overall, children's most commonly used reasoning styles were global standard, personal choice, gender stereotypes, "don't know," and others' welfare. Children used more gender stereotype-related reasoning when they were older and from Hong Kong, appraising the GN boy, or when they perceived the target's behavior as wrong. In contrast, children reasoned based on personal choice more when they were from Canada or when they perceived the target's behavior as right. These findings inform how age-, gender-, and culture-related factors are associated with children's reasoning about the acceptability or appropriateness of varying kinds of childhood gendered behavior. They provide insights regarding children's appraisals of different gender expressions by illuminating not only how they view GC and GN peers but also, from their own perspectives, why they do so. These insights have implications for strategies aimed at decreasing gender-related biases and increasing children's acceptance of gender diversity.

J	Benozio, A; House, BR; Tomasello, M				Benozio, Avi; House, Bailey R.; Tomasello, Michael			Gender and Cultural Differences in the Development of Reciprocity in Young Children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												A foundational mechanism underlying human cooperation is reciprocity. In the context of repeated interactions with others, it is not always clear the degree to which in-kind responses reflect responsiveness to partners' prior behaviors ("reactive" responses), an interest unrelated to the partner ("nonreactive" responses), or any combination of the two. To disentangle these two types of responses, we presented children with sequential, one-shot, and costly interactions between themselves and either egalitarian or selfish peers. Study 1 tested direct, generalized, and normative reciprocal scenarios (N = 144 seven-year-old German children; 50% girls and 50% boys), finding that "nonreactive" responses were dominant for boys and manifested in the form of "selfish" resource distribution. Among girls, "reactive" responses were dominant and manifested in the form of in-kind resource distribution. Study 2 addressed even younger German children (N = 144; 4- to 8-year-old German children; 50% girls and 50% boys), exposing the same phenomenon among 4-year-olds, but not among 5.5-year-olds. Study 3 addressed 7-year-old Israeli children (N = 95; 49% girls and 51% boys), and replicated the basic phenomenon, with an additional cultural variation. The early emergence of gender differences in reciprocity and implications are discussed in cultural, socio-developmental, and evolutionary accounts.

While existing research suggests that parental gender beliefs and caregiving behaviors might influence the development of children's gendered behaviors, little is known about the developmental origins of individual differences in adherence to masculinity norms. The current study aims to address this gap and presents a longitudinal investigation of how parental gender beliefs and maternal sensitivity during infancy contribute to children's adherence to masculinity norms during middle childhood. Data were drawn from a mixed-method 9-year longitudinal study of 374 urban Chinese families (48.40% with daughters). Parental gender beliefs were assessed at 24 months, maternal sensitivity was assessed with mother-child interaction observations at 14 and 24 months, and children's self-reported adherence to masculinity norms were assessed at age 10 years. Results indicate that while parental gender beliefs had no associations with children's adherence to masculinity norms, maternal sensitivity predicted children's adherence to masculinity norms (beta = -.18, p = .008) above and beyond parental gender beliefs and parental education level; moreover, there was a significant interaction of sex on the effect of maternal sensitivity on children's adherence to masculinity (beta = -.23, p = .025), and the association was significant only for boys.					chen, xinyu/HNR-2708-2023	Yang, Rui/0000-0001-5045-5132													0012-1649	1939-0599				JUN	2024	60	6					1097	1108		10.1037/dev0001748	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001748								38661664					WOS:001327348000001

However, few studies have used a longitudinal design to examine changes in gender stereotypes across a range of STEM fields. In a large, preregistered study, we examined the developmental trajectories of two gender stereotypes (involving interest and ability) in four STEM fields across three time points within a calendar year, starting in Grades 2-8. The diverse sample included 803 students ages 7-15 years old at the start of the study (50% girls; 8.5% Asian, 6.0% Black, 25.5% Hispanic/Latinx, 43.7% White, and 16.3% other). Multilevel growth modeling was used to examine developmental trajectories in students' stereotypes for four STEM fields (math, science, computer science, and engineering) while considering both gender and grade level. We found that different STEM disciplines displayed different developmental patterns: Math ability and science interest stereotypes more strongly favored girls over the year among elementary school participants, whereas computer science stereotypes less strongly favored boys over time, and engineering stereotypes (which largely favored boys) were stable across time. The results highlight that the development of stereotypes is not the same for all STEM fields as well as the need to understand the complexity and specificity of developmental change across fields and types of stereotypes.

Being Out in High School: Positive Implications for Well-Being in Three US Cohorts of Sexual Minority Adults	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												For lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer (i.e., sexual minority [SM]) youth, coming out is an important developmental milestone and is typically associated with positive well-being. However, coming out in high school may entail a higher risk of school-based victimization. Due to the greater risk of homophobic bullying, the implications of being out in adolescence and well-being later in adulthood remain unclear. Using data from a national probability survey (Generations Study) of three distinct age cohorts of SM adults (N = 1,474) in the United States, this study (a) examined how being out at school in adolescence affects general well-being in adulthood and (b) SM-specific well-being in adulthood, and (c) examined if these associations differ by cohort. Results from multivariate regression analyses demonstrated that being out in adolescence was not significantly associated with general well-being, but was significantly associated with SM-specific well-being: higher rates of identity centrality and community connectedness, and lower rates of internalized homophobia. There were no cohort differences in the associations between outness in high school, general well-being, and SM well-being. The findings from this national probability sample of SM adults provide novel insight into implications of being out across the life course, including the positive implications of being out at school in adolescence for SM-specific well-being in adulthood.

J	Bhatti, D; Lane, JD; Ronfard, S				Bhatti, Dhanesha; Lane, Jonathan D.; Ronfard, Samuel			Updating Trust: How Children Combine Trait Information With Prior Accuracy as They Interact With an Informant	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												When deciding whether to trust someone's claims, how do children combine-over multiple interactions-information about that person's general behavioral tendencies (traits) with that person's ongoing (and changing) rate of providing accurate claims? Children aged 4-8 played 11 rounds of a find-the-sticker game. For each round, an informant looked into two cups and made a claim about which cup held a sticker. Children guessed the sticker's location and the sticker's actual location was revealed. Prior to the game, children received information that the informant was either honest or dishonest. In Study 1 (N = 201, 105 female, 96 male), the informant provided inaccurate information on the first five trials and then provided accurate information for the remaining trials (55% overall accuracy). In Study 2 (N = 144, 89 female, 55 male), the informant produced a less predictable pattern of (in)accuracy, but remained 55% accurate overall. The trait information children initially received about the informant's honesty strongly influenced their epistemic trust when they lacked additional information about the informant's reliability (the earliest trials). When children's first-hand experiences with the informant prevented them from making strong predictions about the informant's future behavior, only children approximately 7 years and older utilized trait information to guide their epistemic trust. These results demonstrate some similarities in children's causal reasoning about the physical world and their social reasoning. The results also demonstrate developmental patterns in how children weigh different types of social information at different junctures in social interaction.

However, do we think those influences are strong enough to overrule direct evidence of a friend's unreliability? And do preschoolers expect people to show such biases toward friends and to privilege friendship over reliability? Across three experiments, we explored whether friendship influences the evaluations of trust when others learn labels for novel objects as well as personal opinions. After watching scenes involving a main character, her best friend, and a stranger, preschoolers and adults judged who would be trusted for information from the main character's perspective (third person) as well as their own (first person). Adults (n = 128, 55 female, recruited online from across the United States) expected the main character to trust information from her friend even if she had been previously inaccurate, while basing their own first-person judgments on accuracy. In contrast, 4- and 5-year-olds (n = 128, 62 female, from the United States) thought that the main character would be like themselves and prioritize accuracy over friendship. Further, preschoolers expected the main character to trust her (inaccurate) friend and (accurate) stranger equally when forming personal opinions. Thus, young children, unlike adults, do not expect others' epistemic trust to privilege friendship with the speaker over accuracy information.

We used a training approach to test whether verbal attention guidance in a 10 day app-based training that accentuates either analytic or holistic processing has the power to produce enduring effects on 6- to 7-year-old urban German children's (N = 42, 22 female, 20 male) attention in a picture description task, a single-choice recognition task and a change blindness task. Results indicate that verbal attention guidance is effective in influencing children's attention styles across indicators. These findings provide convergent evidence for the assumption that verbal attention guidance plays a central role in the long-term socialization of attention styles.

Yet many young adults in that situation avoid these problems. Close relationships are thought to be a key factor underpinning risk and resilience among this group. To examine this premise, this study explored links, beyond potential confounders assessed in adolescence, between strengths and strains in the social domain and markers of despair in the early and mid-20s in a Canadian sample overrepresenting youth without postsecondary credentials (N = 543, 52% male, 23% non-White). Having a good general ability to maintain supportive relationships was associated with fewer depressive and substance-related symptoms. Furthermore, support and less strain in relationships with parents and friends were associated with fewer depressive symptoms in the early and mid-20s, while for romantic relationships, associations with depressive symptoms became more consistent and robust in the mid-20s. Therefore, support and strains in romantic relationships gradually gained prominence as a determinant of depressive symptoms as youth advanced in adulthood. For substance-related problems, significant associations emerged for strains in friendships only, in both the early and mid-20s. These results suggest that multiple aspects of relationships pose a risk for or protect from the development of diseases of despair in early adulthood and that their relative importance changes depending on outcomes and developmental timing. Thus, facilitating meaningful social connections and reducing the prevalence and impact of relationship strains might contribute to preventing diseases of despair among youth with lower educational attainment.

J	Hines, CT; Steimle, S; Ryan, R				Hines, Caitlin T.; Steimle, Samantha; Ryan, Rebecca			Associations Between Daily Food Insecurity and Parent and Child Well-Being	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Food insecurity poses a serious threat to children's development, but the mechanisms through which food insecurity undermines child development are far less clear. Specifically, food insecurity may influence children through its effect on parents' psychological well-being and parent-child interactions as a result, but past research on the role of parents is correlational and undermined by omitted variable bias. Using a partially rural, low-income sample of parents living in Pennsylvania (N = 272, 90% mother, M-age = 35) and their school-aged children (ages 4-11, 50% female) alongside daily measures of parent-reported food insecurity and parent and child mood and behavior, we examine how daily changes in food insecurity predict daily changes in parent and child well-being, and the extent to which food insecurity operates through parents to affect children. This method not only explores families' daily, lived experiences of food insecurity, but improves upon the methodological issues undermining past research. Findings indicate that food insecurity influences parent and child well-being on a daily basis, but that associations are stronger and sustain longer for parents than children. Further, parent mood and behavior partially explain the association between daily food insecurity and child mood and behavior, but food insecurity is also independently associated with child well-being. This study is the first to examine daily associations between food insecurity and parent and child well-being. Its implications for food assistance programs, policies, and the future of food insecurity research are discussed.

Child Effects on Positive Parenting Vary With Neighborhood Opportunity	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Prior theoretical and empirical research has highlighted links between positive parenting and the socioeconomic characteristics of the family's neighborhood, but has yet to illuminate the etiologic origins of this association. One possibility is that the various predictors of parenting outlined by Belsky (1984; e.g., characteristics of the child, characteristics of the parent, and contextual influences) may matter more in some neighborhood contexts than in others. To examine this possibility, we conducted etiologic moderation analyses in a sample of 1,030 families of twins (average age 8 years; 51% male, 49% female; racial composition: 82% White, 10% Black, 1% Asian, 1% Indigenous, and 6% multiracial) from the Twin Study of Behavioral and Emotional Development in Children in the Michigan State University Twin Registry. Neighborhood and parenting were assessed using multiple informants and assessment strategies (neighborhood and family informants, administrative data, and videotaped parent-child interactions). Results pointed to strong evidence of etiologic moderation, such that child effects on positive mothering were prominent in neighborhoods with little opportunity and near zero in neighborhoods with ample opportunity. Such findings not only reframe the magnitude of child effects on the parenting they receive as context-dependent, but also indicate that mothers in impoverished neighborhoods may be more responsive to their children's characteristics than mothers in neighborhoods with ample opportunity.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				MAY	2024	60	5					878	890		10.1037/dev0001738	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001738								38512191					WOS:001324676200012

The present study examined short-delay (overnight) and long-delay (after a 2-week period) consolidation of new information either congruent or incongruent with prior knowledge in typically developing 6- to 8-year-old children (n = 32), 9- to 11-year-old children (n = 33), and 18- to 30-year-old young adults (YA; n = 39). Both memory accessibility (cued recall of objects) and precision (precision of object placement) of initially well-learned object-scene pairs were measured. Our results showed that overnight, memory accessibility declined similarly in all age groups; memory precision improved more in younger children (YC) compared to older children (OC) and even declined in YA. After a 2-week period, both memory accessibility and precision became worse. Specifically, while age groups showed similar decline in memory accessibility, precision decline was less in YC than in OC and YA. The accessibility and precision of congruent and incongruent information changed similarly with consolidation in all age groups. Taken together, our results showed that, for initially well-learned information, YC have robust memory consolidation, despite their overall lower mnemonic performance compared to OC and YA, which is potentially crucial for stable and precise knowledge accumulation early on in development.

Between-nation differences in temperament were larger than those obtained in similar studies of adult personality, and most pronounced for negative affectivity. Nation-level patterns of negative affectivity were consistent across infancy, toddlerhood, and childhood, and patterns of regulatory capacity were consistent between infancy and toddlerhood. Nations that previously reported high extraversion, high conscientiousness, and low neuroticism in adults were found to demonstrate high surgency in infants and children, and countries reporting low adult openness and high adult neuroticism reported high temperamental negative affectivity. Negative affectivity was high in Southern Asia, Western Asia, and South America and low in Northern and Western Europe. Countries in which children were rated as high in negative affectivity had cultural orientations reflecting collectivism, high power distance, and short-term orientation. Surgency was high in Southeastern and Southern Asia and Southern Europe and low in Eastern Asian countries characterized by philosophies of long-term orientation. Low personal income was associated with high negative affectivity. Gender differences in temperament were largely consistent in direction with prior studies, revealing higher regulatory capacity in females than males and higher surgency in males than females, with these differences becoming more pronounced at later ages. Public Significance Statement<br /> This study is the largest existing effort (59 nations and 83,423 parent reports) to document and understand between-nation differences in the social and emotional behaviors of infants and young children. The results suggest that children in collectivist nations of South America and Southern Asia expressed more negative emotions than those from Northern and Western Europe. Gender differences were relatively consistent across nations and grew stronger with increasing age.					; Perez-Edgar, Koraly/H-7365-2019; Shai, Dana/AAY-5485-2020; Matte-Gagne, Celia/KHZ-3060-2024; Lahti-Pulkkinen, Marius/Q-2472-2017; Salinas-Quiroz, Fernando/D-8247-2013; Peltola, Mikko/M-6654-2016; Soares Moreira, Paulo Alexandre/F-4999-2012	Colonnesi, Cristina/0000-0002-5740-7827; Quadrelli, Ermanno/0000-0002-6834-0912; Salvadori, Eliala Alice/0000-0001-9814-8625; Bajgarova, Zdenka/0000-0002-7539-7570; Perez-Edgar, Koraly/0000-0003-4051-9563; Shai, Dana/0000-0003-2218-4966; Henning, Anne/0009-0007-7282-7655; Matte-Gagne, Celia/0000-0001-5999-2129; Lahti-Pulkkinen, Marius/0000-0002-5244-5525; Salinas-Quiroz, Fernando/0000-0002-1257-6379; Peltola, Mikko/0000-0001-9993-9963; Soares Moreira, Paulo Alexandre/0000-0002-5454-7971; Ola, Bolanle/0000-0002-9828-3365													0012-1649	1939-0599				MAY	2024	60	5					916	941		10.1037/dev0001732	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001732								38573659					WOS:001324676200006

We used data from a Norwegian population-based twin sample including seven birth cohorts (N = 2,879, 56% females). The participants completed self-report questionnaires three times throughout adolescence, with 2 years in between (i.e., 12-18 years old at Wave 1). By using a random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM), we were able to separate stable influences in the measured constructs from the within-person changes at each measurement occasion. In addition, using data from twins allowed us to examine to what degree the associations between life events and loneliness were genetic and/or environmental in nature. The results showed moderate stability of both loneliness and aggregation scores of life events throughout adolescence. The life events were assigned to clusters based on their independence (i.e., events considered dependent or independent on a person's behavior) and desirability (i.e., positive or negative). The time-stable between-person variance in all three measures, loneliness and person-dependent positive and negative life events, could almost exclusively be accounted for by genetic factors. However, as expected, also shared environmental factors influenced person-independent life events. The associations between time-stable between-person variance in loneliness and life events were small, and nearly exclusively due to shared genetic influences. Furthermore, life events do not seem to predict changes in loneliness or vice versa. In conclusion, the self-reported levels of loneliness throughout adolescence seems to be independent of life events.

Drawing from three samples of young Chinese children (born between 2009 and 2019), we aim at examining how inhibition/shyness predicts cooperative behaviors and prosocial behaviors throughout early childhood. In Study 1 (N = 700, children aged between 36 and 72 months), mother-reported inhibition/shyness was negatively associated with mother-reported cooperative and prosocial behaviors during the preschool years. In Study 2 (N = 251, at 6, 15, 25, and 37 months of children's ages), mother-reported inhibition/shyness in infancy was negatively associated with mother-reported cooperative behaviors but was not related to observed cooperative behaviors at the early preschool age. Infancy inhibition/shyness was negatively associated with mother-reported and observed prosocial behaviors. In Study 3 (N = 95, at 14, 25, 38, and 60 months of children's ages), the inhibition/shyness trait, assessed by both observation and maternal report, did not predict any indicators of cooperative behaviors. Early childhood inhibition/shyness, however, still predicted fewer observed and mother-reported prosocial behaviors. On balance, our research supports a negative association between early inhibition/shyness and later prosocial behaviors. The mixed findings concerning cooperative behaviors are interpreted in light of sociopolitical changes in China during the past two decades.					chen, huan/GXZ-8858-2022	Wang, Zhengyan/0000-0003-0178-804X; Dong, Shuyang/0000-0003-1289-7727													0012-1649	1939-0599				MAY	2024	60	5					978	989		10.1037/dev0001711	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001711								38512190					WOS:001324676200008

To expand the limited options for assessing TS, this article tested the psychometric properties of a new Q-set measure (i.e., TS Q-scale) derived from the California Child Q-Set (CCQ-Set) and completed by experimenters. Participants in Study 1 consisted of 243 mothers, their partners, and their preschool children (Mage = 4.60 years; 56% girls; 54% Black or multiracial; 16% Latinx). For Study 2, participants included 201 mothers and their young children (Mage = 2.25 years; 44% girls; 63% Black or multiracial; 11% Latinx). Both longitudinal studies utilized multimethod, multiinformant measurement batteries. The TS Q-scale evidenced satisfactory internal consistencies across both studies. Support for the convergent and discriminant validity in Study 1 was evident in its large, unique, and significantly stronger association with a standard, more extensive, observational assessment of TS when compared with conventional dimensions of temperament. In each study, the TS Q-scale significantly moderated the association between family functioning and latent change analyses of children's functioning for most of the forms of child adjustment. Supporting its predictive validity as a differential susceptibility attribute, children with higher scores on the TS Q-scale exhibited substantially better functioning than their peers in supportive socialization contexts and considerably worse functioning in harsh rearing conditions.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				2024 APR 25	2024										10.1037/dev0001751	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001751		APR 2024						38661665					WOS:001300829100001

Here, we manipulated the spatial frequency (SF) content of the stimuli by selectively removing low spatial frequency (LSF) and high spatial frequency bands using newborn-appropriate cutoffs to investigate what information newborns use when preferring and discriminating between dynamic displays showing happy and fearful expressions unfolding over time. Using a preferential looking paradigm, in Study 1 (N = 63, 59% females, 92% White), we showed that newborns looked longer to happy over fearful expressions in unfiltered (broad spatial frequency) and high-pass (high spatial frequency >0.6 cycles per degree [cpd]) faces but not in low-pass (LSF < 0.5 cpd) faces. In Study 2 (N = 22, 59% females, 91% White), newborns tested in a visual habituation paradigm showed successful discrimination of the two LSF emotions. Results show that newborns can discriminate between dynamic images of happy and fearful facial expressions containing either extreme low SF (<0.5 cpd) information or higher SF (>0.6 cpd) bandwidth. Their preference for the happy expression was present for intact and high-pass filtered faces but not for low-pass faces. This SF effect is tentatively driven by an enhancement of attentional response to the LSF fearful face, whereas the response to the happy face is unaffected by the SF manipulation. Public Significance Statement<br /> The study extends the limited available evidence on newborns' preference for happy facial expressions to dynamic stimuli and demonstrates, for the first time, that attentional responses to happy and fearful faces at birth rely on different spatial frequency content of the stimuli: low and high frequencies, respectively. The visual information available in the image modulates the perceived salience of facial cues of emotions at birth: Newborns only show a preference for happy expressions when presented with unfiltered images or images with intact high-frequency information and not those with high-frequency information filtered out.

Patterns and Correlates of Changes in Sibling Intimacy and Conflict From Middle Childhood Through Young Adulthood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Sibling relationships are most individuals' longest lasting relationships, but their development remains understudied. Using a within-family, accelerated longitudinal design with data from mothers, fathers, and two siblings from 201 predominately White, working-, and middle-class families, we charted the development of sibling intimacy and conflict from age 7 to age 30. We also examined structural characteristics (sibling sex, sex constellation, age spacing, birth order) and both person mean (between-person) and time-varying (within-person) links between (a) feminine-typed, expressive personality and (b) maternal and paternal warmth and conflict and sibling intimacy and conflict, respectively, and tested whether sibling age moderated these linkages. Overall cubic changes suggested that intimacy declined from middle childhood through early adolescence and increased through the mid-20s and leveled off, whereas conflict was stable in middle childhood, declined across adolescence, and leveled off in young adulthood, with patterns that varied by sibling sex, dyad sex constellation, and birth order. Furthermore, expressivity was related to both sibling intimacy (positively) and conflict (negatively) at between- and within-person levels; maternal warmth was positively related to sibling intimacy and maternal conflict was positively related to sibling conflict at both between- and within-person levels; and father warmth and conflict were linked to sibling intimacy and conflict, respectively, at the within-person level. Finally, age moderated expressivity effects such that these disappeared in young adulthood and moderated the between-person father warmth effect such that this effect emerged in young adulthood and increased through age 30. Implications for theory and practice regarding sibling and other close relationships are discussed.

Learners' Causal Intuitions Explain Behavior in Control of Variables Tasks	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Self-directed learners are described as "intuitive scientists," yet they often struggle in assessments of their scientific reasoning skills. We investigate a novel explanation for this apparent gap between formal and informal scientific inquiry behavior. Specifically, we consider whether learners' documented failure to correctly apply the control of variables strategy might stem from a mismatch between task presentation and their intuitions as causal learners. In Experiment 1, children (7- and 9-year-olds) and adults were tested on a version of a traditional multivariate reasoning task (Tschirgi, 1980) that was modified to clarify ambiguous elements of the causal logic in the original design. In all age groups, a significant majority of participants selected informative experiments on this modified task, avoiding confounded actions with positive tangible outcomes. In Experiment 2, we replicate these results with real-world stimuli, and in Experiments 3 and 4, we provide direct evidence that self-directed learners apply specific causal intuitions to experimentation tasks. Together, these findings support a novel alternative interpretation of the apparently paradoxical gap between learners' success in informal exploration and their error-prone experimentation-both behaviors are consistent with an intuitively causal approach to scientific inquiry.

J	Dai, JQ; Griffin, JW; Scherf, KS				Dai, Junqiang; Griffin, Jason W.; Scherf, K. Suzanne			How Is Race Perceived During Adolescence? A Meta-Analysis of the Own-Race Bias	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Adolescence is a critical developmental period that is marked by drastic changes in face recognition, which are reflected in patterns of bias (i.e., superior recognition for some individuals compared to others). Here, we evaluate how race is perceived during face recognition and whether adolescents exhibit an own-race bias (ORB). We conducted a Bayesian meta-analysis to estimate the summary effect size of the ORB across 16 unique studies (38 effect sizes) with 1,321 adolescent participants between the ages of similar to 10-22 years of age. This meta-analytic approach allowed us to inform the analysis with prior findings from the adult literature and evaluate how well they fit the adolescent literature. We report a positive, small ORB (Hedges's g = 0.24) that was evident under increasing levels of uncertainty in the analysis. The magnitude of the ORB was not systematically impacted by participant age or race, which is inconsistent with predictions from perceptual expertise and social cognitive theories. Critically, our findings are limited in generalizability by the study samples, which largely include White adolescents in White-dominant countries. Future longitudinal studies that include racially diverse samples and measure social context, perceiver motivation, peer reorientation, social network composition, and ethnic-racial identity development are critical for understanding the presence, magnitude, and relative flexibility of the ORB in adolescence.

"With Texting, I Am Always Second Guessing Myself": Teenage Perfectionists' Experiences of (Dis)Connection Online	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Little is known about how perfectionistic adolescents experience social connection in online spaces. The current qualitative study addressed this gap by examining themes related to social (dis)connection in online and in-person settings from semistructured interviews with 43 adolescents (M-age = 15.16, SD = 2.43; 62.8% female; 58.1% white; 54.4% self-identified perfectionists). Results demonstrated that perfectionists expressed feeling less connected online than nonperfectionists, likely driven by heightened levels of interpersonal sensitivity. However, a subgroup of perfectionists sought out meaningful online relationships, often in response to a fear or experience of rejection by in-person peers. The results highlight the role of interpersonal sensitivity in fueling feelings of disconnection among adolescent perfectionists in both online and in-person settings, as well as the importance of self-monitoring in the social experiences of perfectionistic youth.

Across two studies (N = 129; 49 boys, 78 girls, two gender unreported; 79 White, 27 Black, six Latinx, five Asian, and 12 unreported), the present work tests hair texture as one possible perceptual mechanism by which this might occur. In both studies, children gender-categorized Black, White, and Asian men and women using MouseTracker. Children were slower and had more complex patterns in categorizing Black women when they had textured hair (Study 1A), but not when they had straight hair (Study 1B).

Prenatal Maternal Immune Activation Predicts Observed Fearfulness in Infancy	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Fear reactivity is an early emerging temperament trait that predicts longer term behavioral and health outcomes. The current analysis tests the hypothesis, an extension of prior research on maternal immune activation (MIA), that the prenatal maternal immune system is a reliable predictor of observed fear reactivity in infancy. The analysis is based on a prospective longitudinal cohort study that collected data from the first trimester and conducted observational assessments of temperament at approximately 12 months of age (n = 281 infants). MIA was assessed from immune biomarkers measured in maternal blood at each trimester; infant temperament was assessed using the Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery assessment at 12 months; covariates included family and sociodemographic factors. Patterns of inflammatory markers across gestation reliably predicted observed temperament: elevated prenatal MIA was associated with high fear reactivity to novel stimuli. The findings provide novel evidence of prenatal origins of fear reactivity and suggest developmental mechanisms that may underlie early emerging individual differences in child temperament. Public Significance Statement<br /> This research examines the prenatal developmental origins of a key aspect of child behavioral development, fear reactivity in infancy. The findings provide the first robust evidence that maternal immune activation in pregnancy is associated with early-emerging fear reactivity. These results extend prior work on prenatal influence on child behavioral development in ways that suggest developmental mechanisms and potential intervention targets for promoting child health and behavioral and social development.

Even though temperament is suggested to have a biological basis, the physiological indicators of inhibitory control remain unclear amid mixed empirical results. In this study, we leveraged a multicohort longitudinal design to examine resting respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) as a physiological correlate of inhibitory control across the early and middle childhood years. Data were collected annually across four time points from cohorts of 4- (n = 150, M-age = 4.53; SD = 0.30; 49.7% female) and 8- (n = 150; M-age = 8.53; SD = 0.29; 49.7% female) year-old children and their caregivers. There were weak, albeit significant, associations between resting RSA and caregiver-reported inhibitory control in middle childhood but not in early childhood. A stronger association was found for older children when latent trait assessments of RSA and inhibitory control were derived from commonalities across the four annual assessments. We conclude that using repeated measures to extract latent trait scores increases power to detect potential physiological indicators of temperament.

One intervention, attachment and bio-behavioral catch-up (ABC), was shown to successfully improve not only young foster children's attachment to their parents, but also their receptive vocabulary skills (Bernard et al., 2017; Raby et al., 2019). Given that language acquisition is intricately linked to parents' sensitive interactions with their children, we ask whether the ABC intervention also improves the quality of parents' talk addressed to children. We test whether the ABC intervention results in more conversational turns between parents and their children. Crucially, we also look within these conversational turns, assessing the number and types of questions that parents ask children. Results suggest that parents who received the ABC intervention do not have more conversational turns or ask higher numbers of questions, compared to parents who received the control intervention. Rather, parents in the ABC group ask a higher proportion of child-led and restatement questions, and a lower proportion of parent-led and pedagogical questions, compared to the control. Additionally, the higher proportion of child-led questions were related to higher parental sensitivity scores. Together, these results suggest that an intervention originally designed to improve children's socioemotional outcomes had positive benefits for the quality of conversations between parents and children.

J	Long, M; Macpherson, SE; Rubio-Fernandez, P				Long, Madeleine; Macpherson, Sarah E.; Rubio-Fernandez, Paula			Prosocial Speech Acts: Links to Pragmatics and Aging	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study investigated how adults over the lifespan flexibly adapt their use of prosocial speech acts when conveying bad news to communicative partners. Experiment 1a (N = 100 Scottish adults aged 18-72 years) assessed whether participants' use of prosocial speech acts varied according to audience design considerations (i.e., whether or not the recipient of the news was directly affected). Experiment 1b (N = 100 Scottish adults aged 19-70 years) assessed whether participants adjusted for whether the bad news was more or less severe (an index of general knowledge). Younger adults displayed more flexible adaptation to the recipient manipulation, while no age differences were found for severity. These findings are consistent with prior work showing age-related decline in audience design but not in the use of general knowledge during language production. Experiment 2 further probed younger adults (N = 40, Scottish, aged 18-37 years) and older adults' (N = 40, Scottish, aged 70-89 years) prosocial linguistic behavior by investigating whether health (vs. nonhealth-related) matters would affect responses. While older adults used prosocial speech acts to a greater extent than younger adults, they did not distinguish between conditions. Our results suggest that prosocial linguistic behavior is likely influenced by a combination of differences in audience design and communicative styles at different ages. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of situating prosocial speech acts within the pragmatics and aging literature, allowing us to uncover the factors modulating prosocial linguistic behavior at different developmental stages.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				MAR	2024	60	3					491	504		10.1037/dev0001725	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001725								38421799					WOS:001181661200012

Despite extensive literature investigating the effect in adults, little work has been done in young children. In three preregistered studies (N = 38, 35, 172; convenience samples from the Northeastern United States), first, we showed that 3-year-old toddlers are highly sensitive to the effect of PI in visual working memory and second, that these effects can originate from the reactivation of previously encoded information. Third, we tested how the ability to cope with PI changes between 2.5 and 7.5 years of age. Besides providing an estimate for the size of the interference effect at the youngest age to date, our findings have an important methodological implication: paradigms that repeat items across trials potentially underestimate young children's working memory abilities.

Alexandra			Neighborhood Features Moderate Genetic and Environmental Influences on Children's Social Information Processing	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Neighborhood is a key context where children learn to process social information; however, the field has largely overlooked the ways children's individual characteristics might be moderated by neighborhood effects. We examined 1,030 six- to 11-year-olds (48.7% female; 82% White) twin pairs oversampled for neighborhood disadvantage from the Twin Study of Behavioral and Emotional Development in Children. We evaluated neighbor reports (N = 1,880) of neighborhood structural and social characteristics as moderators of genetic and environmental influences on children's social processing. Although there was no evidence of moderation for children's hostile attributions, there was robust evidence that the social and structural characteristics of the neighborhood moderated the genetic and environmental origins of children's positive expectations of aggressive behavior. Specifically, we found that genetic influences on aggressive expectations increased in the presence of neighborhood deprivation and decreased in the presence of protective social processes and availability of resources. Such findings suggest that protective neighborhood social processes may buffer against the development of aggressive expectations during middle childhood by suppressing the expression of genetic influences on those outcomes. In doing so, they suggest that neighborhood social processes may be able to promote youth resilience to neighborhood deprivation "under the skin."

Drawing primarily on social identity theory (SIT), this study investigated how U.S. parents' (N = 569) comfort with their children's potential intergroup peer interactions (a) differed by child and peer group gender (boy, girl), race (Black, White), and social class (higher-, middle-, or lower-subjective social status), (b) changed over the transition from childhood to adolescence (8-10, 11-13, and 14-16 years), and (c) varied by context intimacy (hanging out vs. sleeping over). The sample was equally balanced between parents of children reflecting those same group memberships. Consistent with SIT, when asked to choose, parents were typically most comfortable with their child spending time with middle-class peers who shared their child's gender and racial ingroup membership. Moreover, parents often explained their decisions with reference to similarities between these peers and their own child or family. Parents' comfort did not differ systematically by child age, but many parents were less comfortable with cross-gender peer interactions in the more intimate sleepover context than the less intimate hangout context. All groups of parents also exhibited at least some openness to cross-group interactions. These findings advance developmental scientists' understanding of parents' roles as potential facilitators or gatekeepers of their children's intergroup peer interactions.

In this article, we explored the hypothesis that children's memory is influenced by the types of information search strategies they implement, which may emphasize different aspects of the task stimuli. As a consequence, younger children's well-documented search inefficiency may turn out to be advantageous and result in better memory for some aspects of the task. In the current experiment, 5- to 10-year-old children (N = 124) played (active condition) or observed an agent play (passive condition) 20-questions games, and were then tested for their memory of several different aspects of the game both immediately after and a week later. Children showed overall improved recall in the active condition. Search efficiency was positively related to recall of the game's solution, but did not significantly impact performance on the other memory tests.

J	Hok, H; Vasquez, K; Barakzai, A; Shaw, A				Hok, Hannah; Vasquez, Katie; Barakzai, Anam; Shaw, Alex			The Nonmeek Inherit the Earth: Children Generalize Dominance, but Not Submissiveness	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Children and even infants have clear intuitions about power early in development; they can infer who is dominant and subordinate from observing a single interaction. However, it is unclear what children infer about each individual's status from these interactions-do they think dominants and subordinates will maintain their status when interacting with novel partners? In three experiments, we investigate this question. Children (4- to 10-year-olds, N = 365) heard stories about a dominant and subordinate agent and predicted the dominant or subordinate agent's behavior with a novel agent. In all studies, we found that 7- to 10-year-olds generalized dominance, thinking the dominant would again be dominant or "in charge," both for social power (e.g., granting permission) in Study 1 and physical dominance (e.g., a fistfight) in Studies 2 and 3. Furthermore, although they believed dominant agents would win dominance contests (fistfights), they did not believe they would win contests unrelated to dominance (math contests). Younger children did not generalize social power (Study 1) but did generalize physical dominance (Studies 2 and 3). However, even for physical dominance, their generalizations were less selective (i.e., they believed the dominant would win fistfights and math contests). Notably, neither age group generalized an agent's submissiveness in any of the studies-they did not believe a subordinate agent would again be subordinate when paired with a novel partner. We discuss how these results extend past work on children's developing intuitions about dominance and prompt deeper questions about the inferences children draw from dominance interactions.

How He Saw: Jerome Kagan's Contexts of Discovery	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Jerome Kagan was a psychologist and pioneer of developmental psychology, but he was intrigued by the natural sciences and read widely across history, biography, poetry, philosophy, cross-cultural anthropology, and the humanities. Drawing on unpublished archival and other primary source material, this essay describes two of Kagan's seminal studies in child development to demonstrate how their "contexts" facilitated scientific discovery and Kagan's own development as a researcher. A subset of Kagan's archival papers-including grant materials, correspondence, personal notes, and clipped articles-are also discussed to showcase the personal and scholastic material that Kagan read, wrote, and annotated, and which further advanced his scientific thinking. Collectively, these materials reveal the multiple contexts, both applied and private, in which Kagan "saw," thereby guiding his interdisciplinary approach to the scientific study of child development.

How children behave or respond toward diverse social contexts can influence the relation between BI and social adjustment. This study investigated the effect of children's affiliative and antagonistic behavior in cooperative and competitive contexts on the relation between early BI and social adjustment using a longitudinal design. Children's BI (at age 2) was assessed via laboratory observations. Affiliative and antagonistic behaviors (at age 4) were coded during a dyadic truck game in the cooperative and competitive contexts. Children's emotional symptoms and peer problems (at age 4) were assessed using parental reports. These results suggest that high affiliative behavior in the cooperative context was linked to a reduced level of peer problems in inhibited children. Interestingly, highly antagonistic behavior in the competitive context was linked to a reduced level of emotional symptoms in inhibited children. These findings extend our understanding of the role social behavior plays in the social adjustment of behaviorally inhibited children by highlighting the contribution of socially appropriate behaviors in social contexts.

Longitudinal Patterns of Adversity From Childhood to Adolescence: Examining Associations With Mental Health Through Emerging Adulthood Using a Random-Intercept Latent Transition Analysis	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Childhood adversity can have detrimental impacts on life course mental and physical health. Timing, nature, severity, and chronicity of adversity are thought to explain much of the variability in health and developmental outcomes among exposed individuals. The current study seeks to characterize heterogeneity in adverse experiences over time at the individual, family, and neighborhood domains in a cohort of predominantly Black children (85% Black and 15% White, 46.2% girls, 67.2% free/reduced lunch in first grade), and to examine associations with mental health from sixth grade to age 26. Participants were part of a randomized universal preventive interventions trial in first grade with prospective follow-up through early adulthood. Separate models characterized heterogeneity in adversity in elementary, middle, and high schools. Changes in adversity over time and relationships with mental health (anxiety, depression, suicidal behaviors) were investigated using a random-intercept latent transition analysis (RI-LTA). We identified three-class solutions in early childhood, middle school, and high school. Generally, both a higher and a lower poly-adversity class were observed at each time point, with varying nature of adversity characterized by the third class. RI-LTA indicated prevalent within-individual changes in adverse exposure over time and differential associations with mental health and suicidal behaviors. Results suggest that treating adverse exposures as a static construct may limit the ability to characterize salient variation over time. Identifying complexity in adverse experiences and their relation to health and well-being is key for developing and implementing effective prevention and early intervention efforts to mitigate negative effects through the life course.

Maternal autonomy support and intrusive control and child agency and defeat were rated in 15-s intervals by native and bicultural coders. Country was examined as a moderator of the moment-to-moment within-person associations between maternal and child behaviors. The results showed that for both U.S. and Chinese dyads, increases in maternal intrusive control predicted subsequent decreases in child agency, and increases in child defeat predicted subsequent increases in maternal autonomy support. Furthermore, increases in maternal autonomy support predicted subsequent increases in child defeat, but for the Chinese dyads only. Public Significance Statement This study examined how maternal and child behaviors change in response to each other during a challenging puzzle task among U.S. and Chinese dyads. For both U.S. and Chinese preschoolers, children's eagerness and confidence to complete the task decreased immediately after mothers exerted more intrusive control. Additionally, Chinese preschoolers, but not U.S. preschoolers, expressed more defeat and negative emotion immediately after mothers provided more support of the child's autonomy. The findings showed both cultural similarities and differences in the real-time dynamics of mother-child interaction.					wang, mengjiao/IUQ-2337-2023	Chen, Xi/0000-0002-8503-5469													0012-1649	1939-0599				JUN	2024	60	6					1016	1027		10.1037/dev0001723	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001723		FEB 2024						38421784					WOS:001177631900001

Time to Transfer: Long-Term Effects of a Sustained and Spiraled Content Literacy Intervention in the Elementary Grades	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We investigated the effectiveness of a sustained and spiraled content literacy intervention that emphasizes building domain and topic knowledge schemas and vocabulary for elementary-grade students. The model of reading engagement intervention underscores thematic lessons that provide an intellectual structure for helping students connect new learning to a general schema in Grade 1 (animal survival), Grade 2 (scientific investigation of past events like dinosaur mass extinctions), and Grade 3 (scientific investigation of living systems). A total of 30 elementary schools (N = 2,870 students) were randomized to a treatment or control condition. In the treatment condition (i.e., full spiral curriculum), students participated in content literacy lessons from Grades 1 to 3 during the school year and wide reading of thematically related informational texts in the summer following Grades 1 and 2. In the control condition (i.e., partial spiral curriculum), students participated in lessons in only Grade 3. The Grade 3 lessons for both conditions were implemented online during the COVID-19 pandemic school year. Results reveal that treatment students outperformed control students on science vocabulary knowledge across all three grades. Furthermore, intent-to-treat analyses revealed positive transfer effects on Grade 3 science reading (ES = .14), domain-general reading comprehension (ES = .11), and mathematics achievement (ES = .12). Treatment impacts were sustained at 14-month follow-up on Grade 4 reading comprehension (ES = .12) and mathematics achievement (ES = .16). Findings indicate that a content literacy intervention that spirals topics and vocabulary across grades can improve students' long-term academic achievement outcomes.

Participants were 195 English-speaking children, 7 years old, who were enrolled in French immersion programs. Children were assessed for their degree of "home bilingualism," reflecting language use patterns at home, and "school bilingualism," reflecting progress in learning French. None of the children spoke French at home. Participants completed verbal fluency, n-back, and global-local tasks, with conditions within tasks varying in degree of attentional processing required. Type of bilingual experience affected verbal and nonverbal tasks differently. Home bilingualism was positively associated with performance on attentionally demanding conditions of the n-back and global-local tasks, the two nonverbal tasks, whereas school bilingualism was positively associated with performance on English verbal fluency, the linguistic task. In both cases, results were modulated by the degree of bilingual experience. These results underline the importance of specifying the type and degree of bilingual experience and the details of the outcome tasks to understand the impact of bilingualism on children's development.

Program Collaborators	Maternal Education Prospectively Predicts Child Neurocognitive Function: An Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												A large body of research has established a relation between maternal education and children's neurocognitive functions, such as executive function and language. However, most studies have focused on early childhood and relatively few studies have examined associations with changes in maternal education over time. Consequently, it remains unclear if early maternal education is longitudinally related to neurocognitive functions in children, adolescents, and young adults. In addition, the associations between changes in maternal education across development and more broadly defined neurocognitive outcomes remain relatively untested. The current study leveraged a large multicohort sample to examine the longitudinal relations between perinatal maternal education and changes in maternal education during development with children's, adolescents', and young adults' neurocognitive functions (N = 2,688; M-age = 10.32 years; SDage = 4.26; range = 3-20 years). Moreover, we examined the differential effects of perinatal maternal education and changes in maternal education across development on executive function and language performance. Perinatal maternal education was positively associated with children's later overall neurocognitive function. This longitudinal relation was stronger for language than executive function. In addition, increases in maternal education were related to improved language performance but were not associated with executive functioning performance. Our findings support perinatal maternal education as an important predictor of neurocognitive outcomes later in development. Moreover, our results suggest that examining how maternal education changes across development can provide important insights that can help inform policies and interventions designed to foster neurocognitive development.

This variation needs to be systematically quantified to build robust and generalizable theories of language acquisition. We compared communicative interactions between parents and their 2-year-old children (N = 99 families) during mealtime across five cultural settings (Brazil, Ecuador, Argentina, Germany, and Japan) and coded the amount of talk and gestures as well as their conversational embedding (interlocutors, function, and themes). We found a comparable pattern of communicative interactions across cultural settings, which were modified in ways that are consistent with local norms and values. These results suggest that children encounter similarly structured communicative environments across diverse cultural contexts and will inform theories of language learning.

Examining Changes in Adolescents' High School Math and Science Motivational Beliefs and Their Relations to Parental STEM Support and STEM Major Choice at the Intersectionality of Gender and College Generation Status	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Drawing on the situated expectancy-value, dimensional comparison theories, and the intersectionality approach, this article examined the changes in adolescents' math and science motivational beliefs, the parental and college correlates of those beliefs, and the differences at the intersection of gender and college generation status (i.e., female and male first- and continuing-generation college students). Findings based on the nationally representative high-school longitudinal study data (N = 12,070; M-age = 14 years; 54% female students; 28% first-generation college students; and 14% Latinx, 9% Black, 10% Asian, and 57% White) suggest that although adolescents' math and science ability self-concepts declined during high school, their science interest remained stable, and their math and science utility values increased. Adolescents' motivational beliefs in ninth grade and the changes from ninth to 11th grade positively predicted whether they declared a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) college major. Parents' ninth-grade STEM support was more consistently associated with adolescents' concurrent beliefs compared to the changes in their beliefs. Finally, we found that female first-generation college students, who were more likely to be Latinx and Black students, tended to have lower math and science motivational beliefs, received less parental STEM support, and were less likely to choose a STEM major than their peers. The findings of this study indicate adolescents' math and science motivational development in high school matters for their college majors and that certain understudied groups, including female first-generation college students, may experience acute marginalization in STEM and warrant further attention.

Exposure to Community Violence as a Mechanism Linking Neighborhood Disadvantage to Amygdala Reactivity and the Protective Role of Parental Nurturance	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Emerging literature links neighborhood disadvantage to altered neural function in regions supporting socioemotional and threat processing.

In a sample of 7- to 19-year-old twins recruited from disadvantaged neighborhoods (354 families, 708 twins; 54.5% boys; 78.5% White, 13.0% Black, 8.5% other racial/ethnic group membership), we found that exposure to community violence was related to increased amygdala reactivity during socioemotional processing and may be one mechanism linking neighborhood disadvantage to amygdala functioning. Importantly, parenting behavior appeared to modulate these effects, such that high parental nurturance buffered the effect of exposure to community violence on amygdala reactivity. These findings elucidate the potential impact of exposure to community violence on brain function and highlight the role parents can play in protecting youth from the neural effects of exposure to adversity.

Maternal Prenatal Social Disadvantage and Neonatal Functional Connectivity: Associations With Psychopathology Symptoms at Age 12 Months	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Recent research has reported effects of socioeconomic status on neurobehavioral development as early as infancy, including positive associations between income and brain structure, functional connectivity, and behavior later in childhood (Ramphal, Whalen, et al., 2020; Triplett et al., 2022). This study extends this literature by investigating the relation of maternal prenatal social disadvantage (PSD) to neonatal amygdala and hippocampus functional connectivity and whether socioeconomic-related alterations in functional connectivity subsequently predict behavior at age 12 months in a large, socioeconomically diverse sample (N = 261 mother-infant dyads). PSD was assessed across gestation; neonatal magnetic resonance imaging was completed within the first weeks of life; and infant internalizing and externalizing symptoms were evaluated using the Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment at age 12 months. The results showed that PSD was significantly related to neonatal right amygdala and left hippocampus functional connectivity with prefrontal and motor-related regions. Social disadvantage-related right amygdala and left hippocampus functional connectivity with these regions was subsequently related to infant externalizing and internalizing symptoms at age 12 months. Building off an emerging literature exploring prenatal impacts on neonatal functional connectivity, this study further emphasizes the important role of the maternal environment during gestation on infant brain function and its relationship with externalizing and internalizing behavior in the first years of life. The results suggest that the prenatal socioeconomic environment may be a promising target for interventions aimed at improving infant neurobehavioral outcomes.

We designed a guided racism discussion task for U.S. White parents and their 8-12-year-old White children. We explored whether children's and parents' (a) pro-White implicit biases changed pre to postconversation, (b) racial socialization messages (color conscious, external attributions for prejudiced behavior and colorblind racial ideology [CBRI]) predicted changes in each other's implicit biases, and (c) associations varied by the type of racism (subtle vs. blatant) discussed. Children's and parents' biases significantly declined, pre to postdiscussion. Parents' color conscious messages predicted greater declines and messages reflecting CBRI and external attributions predicted smaller declines in children's bias. These patterns were observed during discussions of subtle, but not blatant bias. Effects of children's messages on parents' bias were mixed. Our findings suggest that color conscious parent-child discussions may effectively reduce implicit pro-White bias in White children.

Testing the Predictive Validity of School Performance for Outcomes in Emerging Adulthood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												In putatively meritocratic societies, doing well in school is a pivotal precondition for accessing further and higher education, which, in turn, has a pervasive, long-term influence on adulthood development. Yet, doing well in school may also predict "real-life success" outside formal education settings and independent of the educational qualifications that a person attains. Such predictions are likely to become salient during emerging adulthood, a life period characterized by career explorations and social-emotional adjustment. Here, we tested the predictive validity of end-of-compulsory school grades at age 16 years in a U.K.-representative population cohort sample of up to N = 6,488, who were born between 1994 and 1996, for a broad range of occupational, financial, and social-emotional outcomes at age 23. End-of-compulsory school performance accounted for 1%-20% of the variance across occupational, financial, and social-emotional outcomes in emerging adulthood. Educational attainment attenuated these associations only slightly, with school grades at age 16 accounting for variance in emerging adulthood outcomes independent of later educational attainment. We found that school grades were equally predictive for boys' and girls' outcomes. In children from lower family socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds, school grades were more predictive of their educational attainment, financial attitudes, and anxiety compared to higher SES children, with varying effect sizes (i.e., 0.3%-4.2%). Our findings suggest that school-leaving grades facilitate the successful transition from adolescence to adulthood, independent of educational attainment, and that they might enable children from low-SES families to compensate for some of their background disadvantages.

The participants included 3,417 students (1,714 boys) in fourth, sixth, and eighth grades (M-ages = 10, 12, and 14 years, respectively) in China. Data on affinity for solitude were collected from students' self-reports and data on adjustment were collected from multiple sources. The results showed that whereas affinity for solitude was negatively associated with social competence and academic achievement and positively associated with behavioral problems in Grade 4, the associations were weaker or nonsignificant in Grade 6. Moreover, affinity for solitude was positively associated with academic achievement and negatively associated with behavioral problems in Grade 8. Affinity for solitude was negatively associated with psychological adjustment in general, but the associations were weaker in higher grades. The results indicate that the functional meaning of affinity for solitude may differ across developmental periods. Parents, teachers, and professionals should be aware of the different implications of affinity for solitude in childhood and adolescence and use different strategies to support children and adolescents who display affinity for solitude.					chen, xinyu/HNR-2708-2023; Liu, Junsheng/JDC-3212-2023; Cui, Liying/KIA-2642-2024; Zhou, Jiaxi/KBA-4942-2024														0012-1649	1939-0599				MAY	2024	60	5					954	965		10.1037/dev0001699	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001699		FEB 2024						38358667					WOS:001162472200001

Promoting Scientific Understanding and Conceptual Change in Young Children Using Explanations and Guidance	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Evaluating evidence and restructuring beliefs based on anomalous evidence are fundamental aspects of scientific reasoning. These skills can be challenging for both children and adults, especially in domains where they possess inaccurate prior beliefs that can interfere with the acquisition of correct scientific information (e.g., heavier objects fall faster than light ones). Across two experiments, we examined the additive benefit of combining explanations with guided activities to promote conceptual change. In Experiment 1 (N = 238), 4- and 5-year-olds were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: guidance with explanations, guidance only, or baseline. The guided conditions varied only in the presence or absence of conceptual information (i.e., explanation about gravity). Pre- and posttest measures showed that children's predictions improved from both guided conditions compared to the baseline condition but did not significantly differ from each other. Experiment 2 (N = 80, 5-year-olds) included a delay test and assessed children's learning through the justification of their predictions. Although children's performance at the immediate posttest improved in both conditions, in the guidance only, children's performance returned to the pretest levels of understanding after the delay. Children in the guidance with explanations condition had greater understanding at posttest, retained this understanding long term, and transferred it to objects with the same weight. These findings highlight the role of explanations in aiding children's long-term learning from anomalous evidence in guided activities.

Prenatal Tobacco, Tobacco-Cannabis Coexposure, and Child Emotion Regulation: The Role of Child Autonomic Functioning and Sensitive Parenting	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Prenatal tobacco exposure (PTE) and tobacco-cannabis coexposure (PTCE) co-occur with negative maternal emotional functioning (termed prenatal risks) and together increase risk for child regulatory problems at early school age (ESA). Little is known about developmental processes in early childhood that may mediate this association. We examined two hypothesized mediational processes linking prenatal risks to ESA emotion regulation (ER) and lability-negativity; parasympathetic functioning at toddler age and chronic risk reflected by continued postnatal maternal negative emotional functioning (i.e., depression, anger/hostility, and emotion dysregulation) and substance exposure. Congruent with differential susceptibility theory, we examined interactions between sensitive parenting and toddler parasympathetic functioning predicting ESA ER. Finally, we explored the role of child sex as a moderator. Mothers (N = 247; 53% male infants; 51% Black, 31% White, 19% Hispanic, and 8% other or mixed race) were recruited in the first trimester of pregnancy into one of three groups: PTE (n = 81), PTCE (n = 97), and no substance exposure (n = 69) matched on age and education. Substance exposure was assessed using multiple methods, maternal negative emotional functioning via self-reports, parenting with observations, and child ER using teacher, maternal, and lab assessor reports. Results supported a chronic risk pathway with less support for a parasympathetic pathway. Toddlers who demonstrated respiratory sinus arrhythmia withdrawal to frustration were susceptible to the positive context of sensitive parenting in predicting higher ER. Results emphasize the importance of chronicity of postnatal risks including substance exposure and evaluating the differential impact of positive environments for children with substance exposure.					; Schuetze, Pamela/AGL-7968-2022	Eiden, Rina/0000-0002-5303-3661; Schuetze, Pamela/0000-0001-9348-5788													0012-1649	1939-0599				SEP	2024	60	9			SI		1544	1561		10.1037/dev0001682	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001682		FEB 2024						38358665					WOS:001162471100001

Contributions of Prenatal Risk Factors and Neonatal Epigenetics to Cognitive Outcome in Children Born Very Preterm	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Children born less than 30 weeks gestational age (GA) are at high risk for neurodevelopmental delay compared to term peers. Prenatal risk factors and neonatal epigenetics could help identify preterm children at highest risk for poor cognitive outcomes. We aimed to understand the associations among cumulative prenatal risk, neonatal DNA methylation, and child cognitive ability at age 3 years, including whether DNA methylation mediates the association between prenatal risk and cognitive ability. We studied 379 neonates (54% male) born less than 30 weeks GA who had DNA methylation measured at neonatal intensive care unit discharge along with 3-year follow-up data. Cumulative prenatal risk was calculated from 24 risk factors obtained from maternal report and medical record and epigenome-wide neonatal DNA methylation was assayed from buccal swabs. At 3-year follow-up, child cognitive ability was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (third edition). Cumulative prenatal risk and DNA methylation at two cytosine-phosphate-guanines (CpGs) were uniquely associated with child cognitive ability. Using high-dimensional mediation analysis, we also identified differential methylation of 309 CpGs that mediated the association between cumulative prenatal risk and child cognitive ability. Many of the associated CpGs were located in genes (TNS3, TRAPPC4, MAD1L1, APBB2, DIP2C, TRAPPC9, DRD2) that have previously been associated with prenatal exposures and/or neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Our findings suggest a role for both prenatal risk factors and DNA methylation in explaining outcomes for children born preterm and suggest we should further study DNA methylation as a potential mechanism underlying the association between prenatal risk and child neurodevelopment.

Moreover, some studies have demonstrated an above-chance level chance of concordance between the quality of child-mother and child-father attachment relationships, and child temperament has been offered as a plausible explanation for such concordance. To assess whether temperament plays a role in the development of different attachment network configurations, in this preregistered individual participant data meta-analysis we tested the degree to which the temperament dimension of negative emotionality predicts the number of secure, insecure-avoidant, insecure-resistant, and disorganized attachment relationships a child has with mother and father. Data included in the linear mixed effects analyses were collected from seven studies sampling 872 children (49% female; 83% White). Negative emotionality significantly predicted the number of secure (d = -0.12) and insecure-resistant (d = 0.11), but not insecure-avoidant (d = 0.04) or disorganized (d = 0.08) attachment relationships. Nonpreregistered exploratory analyses indicated higher negative emotionality in children with insecure-resistant attachment relationships with both parents compared to those with one or none (d = 0.19), suggesting that temperament plays a small yet significant role in child-mother/child-father insecure-resistant attachment relationships concordance. Taken together, results from this study prompt a more in-depth examination of the mechanism underlying the small yet significantly higher chance that children with increased negative emotionality have for developing multiple insecure-resistant attachment relationships.

Cognitive and Motivational Numeracy Parenting Practices: Implications for Children's Numeracy Engagement During Early Elementary School	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Parents are considered a major resource in children's numeracy development. The relative role of cognitive and motivational parenting practices, however, is unclear given that the two types of practices have largely been studied in isolation. The current study simultaneously estimated the contributions of several cognitive and motivational parenting practices hypothesized to be important, but which may have overlapping effects. To capture parents' cognitive practices, the level and structure (i.e., prompts vs. statements) of 529 American parents' (80% mothers; 65% White, 20% Black; 33% less than a bachelor's degree) numeracy talk was coded during a challenging numeracy activity. Parents' motivational practices were assessed by coding their autonomy support and control in the activity. Children's (M-age = 7.5 years; 49% girls) engagement of numeracy strategies was also coded. Multilevel minute-to-minute modeling predicting children's engagement from both cognitive and motivational parenting practices indicated that parents' cognitive practices, particularly advanced prompts, predicted children's subsequent engagement of numeracy strategies, which were often advanced. Parents' motivational practices, as reflected in their autonomy support (vs. control), also foreshadowed children's engagement. These effects of the two types of practices were independent of one another. Taken together, the findings are consistent with the idea that cognitive and motivational parenting practices provide distinct resources that can benefit children's math learning.

Examining Timing Effects in the Intergenerational Transmission of Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms: A Genetically Informed Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The present study examined genetic, prenatal, and postnatal environmental pathways in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety and depressive symptoms from parents to early adolescents (when these symptoms start to increase), while considering timing effects of exposure to parent anxiety and depressive symptoms postnatally. The sample was from the Early Growth and Development Study, including 561 adopted children (57% male, 55% White, 13% Black/African American, 11% Hispanic/Latine, 20% multiracial, 1% other; 407 provided data in early adolescence) and their birth (BP) and adoptive parents (AP). Using a trait-state-occasion model with eight assessments from child ages 9 months to 11 years, we partitioned trait-like AP anxiety and depressive symptoms from time-specific fluctuations of AP anxiety and depressive symptoms. Offspring anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed at 11 years (while controlling for similar symptoms at 4.5 years). Results suggested that time-specific fluctuations of AP1 (mostly mothers) anxiety/depressive symptoms in infancy (9 months) were indirectly associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years via offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 4.5 years; time-specific fluctuations of AP1 anxiety/depressive symptoms at child age 11 years were concurrently associated with offspring anxiety/depressive symptoms at 11 years. AP2 (mostly fathers) anxiety/depressive symptoms were not associated with offspring symptoms. Genetic and prenatal influences measured by BP internalizing problems were not associated with offspring symptoms. Results suggested infancy and early adolescence as developmental periods when children are susceptible to influences of parent anxiety and depressive symptoms. Preventive interventions should consider time-specific fluctuations in parent anxiety and depressive symptoms during these developmental periods.

Furthermore, we assessed the protective role of children's early print experiences with books against the adverse effect of maternal depression on language development. Data for mothers and children (51.7% boys, 95% White, N = 11,662) were from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Prenatal maternal depression held an adverse association with child language (beta = -.16, p = .002). Moreover, the risk was greater for girls than boys (beta = .19, p = .02). In addition, prenatal depression was significantly and negatively associated with child verbal intelligence quotient (beta = -.11, p = .02) and performance intelligence quotient (beta = -.12, p = .01). In contrast, postnatal depression or anxiety were not unique predictors of child outcomes. Importantly, children's early experiences with books, as measured by the reported frequency of parent-child shared reading, moderated the negative association between maternal depression and child language development (beta = .30, p < .001). Although modest in size, these findings inform models of child risk and resilience related to maternal psychopathology. The results also have implications for clinical programs as well as for prevention and intervention studies focusing on at-home early literacy.

Comparing the Multivariate Relationships of Conceptual Adversity Models and Structural Brain Development in Adolescent Girls: A Registered Report	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Adverse experiences throughout development confer risk for a multitude of negative long-term outcomes, but the processes via which these experiences are neurobiologically embedded are still unclear. Adolescence provides an opportunity to understand how these experiences impact the brain's rapidly changing structure. Two models are central to current adversity conceptualizations: a cumulative risk model, where all types of experiences are combined to represent accumulating stress, and a dimensional model, where certain features of experience (e.g., threat or deprivation) exert unique neurophysiological influence. In this registered report, we extended upon previous research by using a form of representational similarity analysis to examine whether the dimensional and cumulative risk models of adversity predict cortical thinning in frontoparietal and frontotemporal networks and volumetric changes in subcortical regions throughout adolescence. Drawing from a longitudinal sample of 179 adolescent girls (ages 10-13 years at the first wave) from Lane County, Oregon, United States, and up to four waves of follow-up data, we found that operationalizing adversity by similarity in threat and deprivation provided better prediction of brain development than similarity in overall adversity. However, these dimensions do not exhibit unique associations with developmental changes in the hypothesized brain changes. These results underscore the significance of carefully defining adversity and considering its impact on the entire brain.

This 3-year longitudinal study examined the developmental patterns of self- and group orientations and their relations with adjustment among Chinese adolescents. The participants included 1,257 students (648 boys, initial M-age = 13.37 years, SD = 0.63 years). Data on self- and group orientations and social and behavioral adjustment were obtained from multiple sources, including self-reports, peer nominations, and teacher ratings. The results showed that self-orientation increased, and group orientation decreased during early adolescence. Moreover, an increase (slope) in self-orientation was positively associated with subsequent assertive behavior, whereas a slower decrease in group orientation was positively associated with subsequent prosocial behavior and peer preference. The initial level (intercept) of self-orientation was positively associated with later externalizing problems, and the initial level of group orientation was negatively associated with later internalizing problems. The intercepts of self- and group orientations were higher for boys than girls. No significant gender differences were found in the slopes of self- and group orientations or in the associations of intercepts and slopes with adjustment outcomes. The results indicated different developmental patterns of self- and group orientations and their different implications for adjustment in Chinese adolescents.

Real-Time Teaching and Learning: Caregivers Teaching Infants to Descend Stairs	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Learning to descend stairs requires motor and cognitive capacities on the part of infants and opportunities for practice and assurance of safety offered by caregivers. The American Academy of Pediatrics prescribes the age strategy to teach toddlers to safely descend stairs but without much consideration for individual differences in infants' skills or caregivers' techniques. The purpose of this study was to observe the natural ways in which caregivers teach infants to descend stairs at home and the extent to which infants abide. Of particular interest was to examine the dynamic nature of caregivers' teaching and infants' learning over the session with attention to individual differences. Dyads (N = 59) were videorecorded on Zoom for 10 min interacting on stairs at home in the United States, Brazil, Canada, Italy, and Spain. Infants (n = 30 girls, 29 boys; 13-month-olds +/- 1 week) were novice walkers (M = 2.04 months walking experience). Caregivers used a variety of teaching strategies and focused on "backing" and "scooting." Infants were more likely to heed caregivers' guidance when caregivers provided hands-on support and verbal encouragement suggesting infants were engaged and responsive to caregivers' overtures. Infants' walking experience predicted change in descent strategy over the session. Although infants did not show evidence of learning over the session, consistent caregiver instruction suggested caregivers were persistent, if not effective, teachers. Teaching and learning motor skills in a potentially risky task creates a unique opportunity for interaction, allowing infants and caregivers to learn from one another.

Historically, the study of rehearsal development has diverged from the study of self-talk more generally. The current experiment examines whether two characteristics of self-talk (impact of task difficulty and self-talk's narrative vs. planning purpose) are also observed in rehearsal. Eighty children, ages 4-7, were tasked with remembering the three-item and six-item lists over a 15-s delay. Children's spontaneous use of fixed rehearsal (i.e., immediate repetition of a just-presented item) and cumulative rehearsal (i.e., cycling through multiple items at a time) was documented from video recordings. Four-year-olds narrated item presentations using fixed rehearsal. Six- and seven-year-olds proactively planned for recall by engaging cumulative rehearsal. Five-year-olds used both forms of rehearsal, but their frequency of cumulative rehearsal was dependent on list length. Therefore, rehearsal is susceptible to task manipulations that affect other forms of self-talk.

The current review outlines evidence that prenatal depression is associated with offspring cardiometabolic risk and health behaviors. We review evidence of these associations in humans and in nonhuman animals at multiple developmental periods, from the prenatal period (maternal preeclampsia, gestational diabetes), neonatal period (preterm birth, small size at birth), infancy (rapid weight gain), childhood and adolescence (high blood pressure, impaired glucose-insulin homeostasis, unfavorable lipid profiles, abdominal obesity), and into adulthood (diabetes, cardiovascular disease). In addition to these cardiometabolic outcomes, we focus on health behaviors associated with cardiometabolic risk, such as child eating behaviors, diet, physical activity, and sleep health. Our review focuses on child behaviors (e.g., emotional eating, preference for highly palatable foods, short sleep duration) and parenting behaviors (e.g., pressuring child to eat, modeling of health behaviors). These changes in health behaviors may be detected before changes to cardiometabolic outcomes, which may allow for early identification of and prevention for children at risk for poor adult cardiometabolic outcomes. We also discuss the methods of the ongoing Care Project, which is a randomized clinical trial to test whether reducing prenatal maternal depression improves offspring's cardiometabolic health and health behaviors in preschool. The goal of this review and the Care Project are to inform future research, interventions, and policies that support prenatal mental health and offspring cardiometabolic health.

Resilience to Stress During Pregnancy: Biopsychosocial Mechanisms and Implications for Offspring Emotional and Behavioral Outcomes in Toddlerhood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Exposure to high levels of stress during pregnancy is a known risk factor for a wide range of offspring outcomes, but little is known about the biopsychosocial factors underlying resilience and recovery from stress during pregnancy. The current study investigated associations between emotional and instrumental support during pregnancy and resilience to stress during pregnancy, including perceived resilience (belief in ability to "bounce back" from adversity) and physiological resilience (ability to physiologically recover quickly after an acute stressor). We further tested whether support and resilience during pregnancy predicted offspring internalizing and externalizing behaviors. Participants included 130 pregnant women (ages 26-28 years; 58% Black, 27% White, 15% Multiracial; 28% receiving public assistance) from a population-based longitudinal study. During pregnancy, participants reported on emotional and instrumental support, current life stressors, and perceived resilience to stress. In addition, heart rate variability was recorded continuously before, during, and after a controlled stress test to measure physiological recovery from stressors. When offspring were 2-3 years of age, mothers reported on children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Results from moderated mediation analyses indicated that emotional, but not instrumental, support was associated with perceived resilience during pregnancy, which predicted lower internalizing and externalizing problems in offspring. Emotional support also predicted greater physiological recovery during pregnancy, but only for individuals reporting multiple life stressors. Findings suggest that emotional support may influence psychological and physiological responses to stress during pregnancy, with implications for offspring emotional and behavioral health. Clinical implications of these results and directions for future research are discussed.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				SEP	2024	60	9			SI		1733	1745		10.1037/dev0001695	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001695		FEB 2024						38358671					WOS:001162452700001

DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Infants' sensitivity to transitional probabilities (TPs) supports language development by facilitating mapping high-TP (HTP) words to meaning, at least up to 18 months of age. Here we tested whether this HTP advantage holds as lexical development progresses, and infants become better at forming word-referent mappings. Two groups of 24-month-olds (N = 64 and all White, tested in the United States) first listened to Italian sentences containing HTP and low-TP (LTP) words. We then used HTP and LTP words, and sequences that violated these statistics, in a mapping task. Infants learned HTP and LTP words equally well. They also learned LTP violations as well as LTP words, but learned HTP words better than HTP violations. Thus, by 2 years of age sensitivity to TPs does not lead to an HTP advantage but rather to poor mapping of violations of HTP word forms.					karaman, ferhat/HSF-1166-2023	Lany, Jill/0000-0001-8077-6244													0012-1649	1939-0599				MAR	2024	60	3					567	581		10.1037/dev0001641	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001641		JAN 2024						38271022					WOS:001149621900001

Exploring Whether and How Black and White Parents Talk With Their Children About Race: M(ai)cro Race Conversations About Black Lives Matter	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Previous research on parent-led race conversations reports robust racial differences in the content of race conversations between Black and white parents. It was unknown, however, whether these racial differences shifted in the months immediately following the summer of 2020 when there was heightened public attention directed toward white parents, specifically, to talk with children about racism. In the present study, we investigated whether and how Black (n = 344) and white (n = 381) parents talked about Black Lives Matter (BLM) with their 8- to 11-year-old children. Overall, 80% of parents (n = 725) reported talking about BLM, but Black parents were significantly more likely to discuss BLM than white parents (p = .008). Further qualitative analysis of the content of parents' reports showed that Black parents were significantly more likely than white parents to provide responses about BLM that acknowledge racial inequality in society or explicitly affirm/support Black lives. White parents, in contrast, were significantly more likely to discuss BLM by focusing on equality but without acknowledging racial injustice or to provide responses that lacked clarity and/or substance. Using the m(ai)cro model of human development (Rogers, Niwa, et al., 2021), we discuss how parents' reported race conversations are shaped by the sociopolitical context and their role in disrupting (or perpetuating) systemic racism through socialization.					rogers, onnie/AAR-2683-2021; Meltzoff, Andrew/GPC-8807-2022	Meltzoff, Andrew/0000-0001-8683-0547; Eisenman, Sarah R/0009-0003-3022-7185													0012-1649	1939-0599				MAR	2024	60	3					407	421		10.1037/dev0001693	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001693		JAN 2024						38252102					WOS:001145850500001

The sample size was 299 (50.9% female; 1% Asian, 4% multiple races; 14% Black; 78% White), and participants were recruited in the United States (a rural college town in Virginia and a midsized city in North Carolina). Higher child EXT at 6 years predicted higher HP at 7-8 years, which predicted higher EXT at 9 years. Also, this path was moderated by 6-year child effortful control, 6-year resting RSA, and 9-year executive function. In contrast, there was no moderating effect of any measure of maternal regulation. Findings suggest it is important to consider child self-regulation when examining bidirectionality in parent and child effects for HP and child EXT.

J	Söldner, L; Mammen, M; Paulus, M				Soeldner, Lena; Mammen, Maria; Paulus, Markus			The Emergence of a Coherent Self-Concept: A Longitudinal Study on the Development of the Moral Self	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The moral self-concept (MSC) is an early indicator of how children view themselves as moral agents. It has been proposed that an important feature of an established self-concept (SC) is sufficient coherency in how one views oneself. Furthermore, the MSC is expected to develop into a multidimensional, hierarchical construct which is stable over time. Investigating these theoretical hypotheses, this study aims to take three aspects into account to get a deeper insight into when and how the MSC first emerges: emergence of coherency, stability, and a differentiated structure. Preschoolers were presented with a puppet-interview at two measurement points (T1: M = 4.21 years, T2: M = 5.43 years, N = 108-133; 51%-57% female, largely Caucasian). The interview comprises three moral (helping, sharing, comforting), a physical, and a verbal self-concept scale. To investigate whether children had an established SC and therefore answered coherently, we analyzed children's response patterns resulting in a coherency-score: The greater answers vary within scales, the lower children score. Coherency of the MSC rose significantly across preschool period: At age 5, children answered largely coherently. Coherency of children's MSC related to its stability, meaning that the MSC was mostly stable for children with high coherency at T1. Factor analysis confirmed a multidimensional structure of the MSC at age 5, but not at age 4. The results demonstrate that a coherent and differentiated MSC is acquired within the preschool period. This offers a new approach to investigate the emergence of the SC in early development by integrating the important aspect of coherency into the area of SC research.

Behavioral Inhibition in a Translational Nonhuman Primate Model: A Pilot Study of Kagan's Behavioral Inhibition Paradigm Modified for Use in Infant Rhesus Macaques (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>)	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Behavioral inhibition (BI), a temperamental trait first described by Jerome Kagan, is characterized by wariness to unfamiliar persons and novel situations. BI is a moderately stable trait, with biological and genetic underpinnings. Kagan's methodology for assessing BI is widely used in humans. Although this paradigm could be readily translated for use in nonhuman primates, thereby increasing generalizability from nonhuman primates to humans and fortifying evidence that BI is evolutionarily conserved, researchers have not done so. To address this, this study utilized a modified version of Kagan's paradigm to assess behaviors and biological markers of BI in nonhuman primates. Over the first 5 weeks of life, nursery-reared rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta; N = 12) were rated using the standardized Infant Behavior Assessment Scale for nonhuman primates on measures related to BI (consolability, irritability, struggle, and predominant state). Three months later, behavioral assessments were made in relation to a novel playroom, an unfamiliar peer, and a variety of attention-grabbing, unfamiliar stimuli, followed by the introduction of a human stranger. Behaviors from Kagan's studies of BI in toddlers (freezing, exploration, and latency to approach) and physiological measures related to BI (heart rate) were assessed. Random effects models showed that subjects rated high in temperamental BI spent less time exploring the environment and socializing with peers and more time freezing (an indication of anxiety in rhesus monkeys). These findings suggest that Kagan's paradigm is readily adapted for use in nonhuman primates and support the utility of rhesus monkeys as translational models for assessing the causes and consequences of human BI.

Trajectories of Math Expectancies for Success and Values in Latinx and Asian Students	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The heterogeneity in the developmental trajectories of math motivational beliefs (i.e., expectancies for success and subjective task value beliefs) was examined among Asian and Latinx male and female students from Southern California across Grades 8 through 10 (n = 2,710; 50% female; 85% Latinx; 15% Asian; M-age = 13.77). By conducting growth mixture modeling, we identified two classes of stable trajectories for expectancies for success; five classes of stable, decreasing, or increasing trajectories for interest and utility value; and three classes of stable, decreasing, or increasing trajectories for attainment value. The group comparisons demonstrated that variability exists in adolescents' motivational belief development at the intersection of their race/ethnicity and gender for some trajectories. For example, Latina adolescents were more likely to maintain moderate expectancies for success than high expectancies for success compared to Latino and Asian male adolescents, but Asian female adolescents did not differ in their level of expectancies for success from the two male groups. Also, we found Latina adolescents displayed smaller decreases in interest compared to Asian female adolescents and in utility value compared to Latino adolescents. The findings from the present study challenge traditional stereotypes in math and highlight positive motivational belief development in students who are marginalized in math (e.g., Latina adolescents).

In two experiments, we investigated whether 3- to 5-year-olds (total N = 240 from diverse backgrounds) might be more likely to include fantastical events in stories about familiar fantasy characters. In Experiment 1, children saw stories about fantasy or real-world characters (e.g., a mermaid or an ordinary woman) and judged whether they would achieve goals using fantastic or realistic methods. Children were more likely to choose fantastic methods for the fantasy characters, and this tendency was more common in older children. In Experiment 2, children were asked yes/no questions about whether characters could use fantastic, realistic, and unusual methods to achieve goals. Children more often affirmed fantastic methods for fantasy than real-world characters. These findings contrast with previous work suggesting children avoid including fantastic events in fiction and suggest that children use precedent and familiarity to decide what can happen in a story.

Academic Achievement, Same- and Cross-Ethnic Positive Peer Regard Among Asian American and Latinx Adolescents	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This article presents a short-term longitudinal study examining bidirectional associations between academic achievement and positive peer regard among Asian American and Latinx adolescents. Specifically, our investigation distinguished between positive peer regard within and across different ethnic groups in a diverse school setting. Three hundred and thirty-five middle school students (52.8% girls; 65% Asian American, 35% Latinx; assessment at the first time point M-age = 12.27 years, SD = 0.71) were followed across two consecutive school years. Participants completed a peer-nomination inventory assessing multiple dimensions of positive peer regard (i.e., reciprocal friendship, social acceptance, and respect), and grades were obtained from school records. Academic achievement was predictive of prospective positive peer regard received from same-ethnic peers only for Asian American adolescents. In contrast, academic achievement predicted prospective positive peer regard received from cross-ethnic peers only for Latinx adolescents. These results suggest that academic achievement was linked to social gains with peers from different ethnic backgrounds for Asian American and Latinx students. The findings underscore the importance of disentangling the sources of positive peer regard in multiethnic school environments.

First, we examined profiles of reactivity in 4-month-old infants using the traditional theory-driven analytic approach laid out by Jerome Kagan and colleagues, and derived groups characterized by extreme patterns of negative reactivity and positive reactivity. We then used a theory-neutral, data-driven approach to create latent profiles of reactivity from the same infants. Despite differences in sample characteristics and recruitment strategy, we noted similar reactivity groups relative to prior cohorts. The current data-driven approach found four profiles: high positive, high negative, high motor, and low reactive. Follow-up analyses found differential predictions of internalizing, externalizing, dysregulation, and competence trajectories across 12, 18, and 24 months of life based on 4-month reactivity profiles. Findings are discussed in light of the initial formulation of early reactivity by Kagan and the four decades of research that has followed to refine, bolster, and expand on this approach to child-centered individual differences.

Is Reproductive Development Adaptively Calibrated to Early Experience? Evidence From a National Sample of Females	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Many developmental theories have not been sufficiently evaluated using designs that control for unobserved familial confounds. Our long-term goal is to determine the causal structure underlying associations between early environmental conditions and later psychosocial and health outcomes. Our overall objective in this study was to further evaluate predictions derived from applications of life history theory to female reproductive development, key among them that reproductive milestones translate early environmental risk into fertility, health, and behavioral outcomes. To this end, we used female data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and structural equation modeling to conduct increasingly severe tests, beginning with covariate control and then progressing to sibling control and behavioral genetic designs. After adjusting for confounds varying between sets of siblings, we did not find evidence that age at menarche reflected components of early environment or that any focal outcomes reflected early fragmented family structure (birth to age nine). Although we detected no links between measured environment and individual differences in age at sexual debut, we did find that it reflected both shared and nonshared influences in our behavior genetic models. Interestingly, delayed sexual debut (into young adulthood) reflected identification of parents as the greatest influences and forecasted an array of fertility-related outcomes. Taken together, these findings challenge theories suggesting menarche timing is adaptively calibrated to early environment. They also highlight the need for more research using sibling control and related designs to examine the roles of environments in development.

Associations Between Adolescent Friends' Responses During Problem Talk and Depressive Symptoms	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The present study examined how friends' responses to each other during problem talk predicted depressive symptoms over time. Participants included 271 adolescent friend dyads (69 female and 69 male early adolescent dyads; 72 female and 61 male middle adolescent dyads; 66.4% White and 26.6% Black). The adolescents were observed discussing a problem with the friend and reported on depressive symptoms at the time of observation and 9 months later. Friends' responses were coded into one of nine response type categories (i.e., four positive/engaged response types, one neutral response type, and four negative/disengaged response types). Actor-partner interdependence models revealed significant actor and partner effects for both positive and negative responses. Notably, receiving and/or producing positive/engaged responses, including saying something supportive, sharing related experiences, and asking questions, were associated with lower depressive symptoms over time. Receiving and/or producing negative/disengaged responses, including sharing one's own experience in a distracting way, changing the subject, saying something unsupportive or minimizing the problem, and saying nothing at all heightened risk for depressive symptoms. Additionally, significant Actor x Partner interactions revealed that greater differences between the friends in the degree to which they produced supportive responses were associated with increased depressive symptoms and that both friends saying nothing at all was associated with increased depressive symptoms. When gender and grade differences were found, the associations typically were particularly strong for middle-adolescent girls. These results highlight the importance of attending to friends' specific behaviors in social support contexts.

Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory and Externalizing Problems Across Early Adolescence: Testing Within-Person Reciprocal Associations	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Temperament and externalizing problems are closely linked, but research on how they codevelop across adolescence remains sparse and equivocal. Reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) provides a useful framework for understanding temperament and externalizing problems associations. During adolescence, oppositional problems are posited to be linked to an overactive behavioral approach system (BAS) while conduct problems are linked to an underactive behavioral inhibition system (BIS). However, this research mostly uses adult samples and cross-sectional designs and tests only between-person associations. Moreover, most studies typically test only one direction of effects (i.e., temperament predicts externalizing problems) and do not consider alternative models of associations, such as reciprocal associations. To address these limitations, we use three annual waves of a longitudinal, community-based sample of 387 early adolescents (mean Wave 1 age = 11.61 years, 55% female, 83% non-Hispanic White) to test reciprocal associations between BIS and BAS and oppositional and conduct problems. Latent curve models with structured residuals are used to test hypotheses and disaggregate between- and within-person associations. Evidence supports within-person reciprocal associations between BAS and oppositional problems and between BIS and combined conduct and oppositional problems. Results potentially inform developmental theories of temperament and externalizing problems linkages and interventions with adolescents who are engaging in oppositional problems and more severe conduct problems.

Longitudinal Relations Between Independent Walking, Body Position, and Object Experiences in Home Life	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												How do age and the acquisition of independent walking relate to changes in infants' everyday experiences? We used a novel ecological momentary assessment (EMA) method to gather caregiver reports of infants' restraint, body position, and object holding via text messages sparsely sampled across multiple days of home life at 10, 11, 12, and 13 months of age. Using data from over 4,000 EMA samples from N = 62 infants recruited from across the United States and sampled longitudinally, we measured changes in the base rates of different activities in daily life. With age, infants spent more time unrestrained. With the onset of walking, infants spent less time sitting and prone and more time upright. Although rates of object holding did not change with age or walking ability, we found that infants who can walk hold objects more often in an upright position compared with nonwalkers. We discuss how accurately measuring changes in lived experiences serves to constrain theories about developmental mechanisms.

Predicting Pointing From Early Socioemotional Communication With Mothers, Fathers, and Strangers Through the Lens of Temperamental Reactivity	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Socioemotional and referential communication are primary expressions of interpersonal engagement in infancy and beyond. Early socioemotional communication in dyadic interactions may form a foundation for triadic referential communication and gesture production, yet the role of temperament in moderating their association has not been examined. We investigated whether early socioemotional communication behaviors, and infant temperamental reactivity, were associated with later pointing production. Participants were 51 infants (45% girls) and both their parents (86.5% Dutch). Early infant socioemotional communication (production of smile, vocalizations, and gaze) was observed during separate home-based face-to-face interactions with mothers, fathers, and strangers at 4 and 8 months. At both ages, mothers and fathers reported on infant temperamental surgency and negative affectivity, and overall means were calculated. Referential communication (declarative pointing) was measured during structured lab-based observations at 12 and 15 months. Socioemotional and referential communication behaviors were microanalytically coded second by second. Poisson multilevel regression analyses indicated interaction effects between temperament and smile, vocalizations, and gazes to the adult's face with each partner in predicting pointing. High levels of infant temperamental surgency tended to enhance positive associations between early socioemotional communication behaviors with mothers and fathers and pointing. By contrast, high levels of negative affectivity tended to dampen associations between early communication behaviors with strangers and pointing. Results highlight the importance of infant socioemotional communication with diverse partners and the moderating role of temperamental reactivity in predicting referential communication.

The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to target these changes through the characterization of the main dimensions in self-defining memories (SDMs; thematic content, specificity, integrative meaning, tension, contamination/redemption, and emotion) and their interactions. Our final sample was composed of 652 healthy French adults aged from 18 to 97 years, divided into four age groups: young adults (n = 163, M = 23.7 years), middle-aged adults (n = 135, M = 44.0 years), young-old adults (n = 178, M = 64.5 years), and old-old adults (n = 176, M = 79.6 years). Participants were asked to recollect three SDMs. A similar pattern of thematic content was observed throughout adulthood, except for relationship narratives were more frequent in the two younger groups. The findings highlighted that specific and integrated SDMs decreased with age and that tension and contaminative sequences were the most frequent in young adults. Redemptive memories did not significantly differ whatever the age of participants. No clear positivity effect was observed with aging. Finally, an analysis of the correlations among the main SDMs' dimensions showed that specificity correlated positively with tension in young adults and integrative meaning with redemption in young and middle-aged participants. We found no significant correlation between specificity and integration in any age group. For the first time, this study sheds new light on lifelong identity adjustments.

The Benefits of Math Activities Depend on the Skills Children Bring to the Table	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Playing board games and other math activities can provide young children with opportunities to develop their math skills. However, it is critical to understand for whom these activities may be most beneficial. In two studies, we examine the extent to which foundational cognitive skills moderate the effects of playing math games on math skills. In Study 1, we look cross-sectionally at the association between parents' frequency of math activities with their 3- to 4-year-old children (N = 124) and children's math achievement, examining the extent to which children's skills moderate this relation. We find that frequent math activities are only associated with better math performance for children with better number knowledge. In Study 2, we test this experimentally by randomly assigning parents and children (N = 76) to play with a number-related board game, an active control board game, or a business-as-usual control group. Controlling for number knowledge, inhibitory control, and vocabulary at pretest, no differences in math skills at posttest were observed between the training groups. However, a significant interaction emerged between training group assignment and number knowledge, such that children with higher pretest number knowledge had higher posttest math scores when assigned to the number board game condition compared to the two control conditions, but no differences among conditions were seen for children with lower number knowledge. Collectively, these findings suggest that math activities may be most beneficial for math skills when children have stronger number knowledge and underscore the need for tailoring activities to children's current skill level.

Children's Reasoning About Socioeconomic Status Predicts Inclusion and Resource Bias	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Children's socioeconomic status (SES) is linked to disparate access to resources and affects social behaviors such as inclusion and resource allocations. Yet it is unclear whether children's essentialized view of SES (i.e., believing SES is immutable) or subjective social status (SSS) influences behavioral biases toward high- versus low-SES peers. We measured 4- to 9-year-old children's SES essentialism and SSS to test whether these predict inclusion and resource allocations to high- versus low-SES peers (N = 127; from a midsize city in the Southeastern United States; 49.6% female; parent-reported 54.2% White, 2.8% Black, 8.3% Latine, 5.6% Asian, 1.4% another race, 27.8% multiracial, 43.3% not provided). We also compared children's SES beliefs to their parent's. Children's SES essentialism and SSS decreased across the ages tested, and children reported higher SSS than their parents. Parents' SES essentialism predicted younger (but not older) children's SES essentialism. Moreover, SES essentialism mediated the negative relationship between age and preference for including high-SES peers, while SSS mediated the negative relationship between age and preference for allocating more resources to high-SES peers. This suggests that beliefs about the nature of SES may influence sociorelational behavior like including or excluding others, while perceived social status (SSS) may influence resource allocations. Furthermore, older children and those with lower SES essentialism included low- versus high-SES peers more often while older and lower SSS children distributed more resources toward low- versus high-SES peers. Thus, children's SES essentialism and SSS may also influence their behaviors to either perpetuate or rectify inequality.

Previously Institutionalized Toddlers' Social and Emotional Competence and Kindergarten Adjustment: Indirect Effects Through Executive Function	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Longitudinal multimethod data across three time points were examined to explore the associations between previously institutionalized toddlers' (N = 71; 59% female) socioemotional skills (Time Point 1: 18 months to 3-years-old), executive functioning (i.e., attention, working memory, inhibitory control) in the preschool years (Time Point 2: 2-4-years-old), and adjustment in kindergarten (5-6-years-old). Children were from multiple regions (35% Eastern European, 31% Southeast Asian, 25% African, and 9% Latin American), and 90% of adoptive parents were White from the Midwestern United States. Socioemotional competency at Time Point 1 was associated with fewer attention problems and greater inhibitory control at Time Point 2, which were subsequently associated with more observed social competence, greater observed classroom competence, and less teacher-reported teacher-child conflict in kindergarten. Indirect effects from socioemotional competencies in toddlerhood to kindergarten adjustment via executive functioning during the preschool period emerged.

At 6-month intervals, caregivers reported on toddlers' Spanish and English words produced as well as their language exposure at home. Video recordings at child age 18 months yielded estimates of toddlers' speech output (word tokens per minute). In addition, at child age 18 months, caregivers reported on toddlers' linguistic skills (comprehension), demographic background (gender, household income), and nonverbal behaviors (gesture production). Results showed that toddlers were exposed to both English and Spanish and received more Spanish than English from primary caregivers; there were no significant primary caregiver input differences across time. Growth modeling revealed linear growth rates for Spanish and conceptual (Spanish, English combined) vocabulary and a curvilinear trajectory for English vocabulary. Furthermore, toddlers' Spanish and conceptual vocabularies were positively associated with their higher frequencies of token use, greater production of gesture, and greater comprehension skills, even after controlling for input. Moreover, Spanish and conceptual growth rates were positively associated with higher token use. In terms of English, toddlers' vocabulary at child age 18 months was positively associated with their comprehension skills. Toddlers' use of more gestures and tokens as well as gender (boys) influenced their English acceleration rates over time. Findings indicate that unique trajectories exist for each of a bilingual's languages and these trajectories are differentially influenced by child-level factors, including their speech output, not only exposure to language.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				JAN	2024	60	1					144	158		10.1037/dev0001651	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001651		NOV 2023						38032662					WOS:001110779200001

The current article examined the real-time behavioral mechanisms underlying these associations using Granger causality time series analyses in a sample of mothers (N = 194; 86.60% White) at elevated risk for depression and their 3-month-old infants (46.40% female) living in a major metropolitan area in the United States. Overall, mothers contingently responded to infant distress, and mothers' responses to infant distress increased the likelihood of infant soothing in real time. However, there was no evidence for maternal contingent responding or facilitation of infant soothing in subsamples of mothers who were currently experiencing elevated depression symptoms or in mothers of highly negative infants. These findings suggest real-time behavioral mechanisms by which risks for maladaptive self-regulation may develop.						de Barbaro, Kaya/0000-0001-6316-0085													0012-1649	1939-0599				FEB	2024	60	2					294	305		10.1037/dev0001607	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001607		NOV 2023						38032661					WOS:001110780000001

Testing Exploratory Narrative Processing as a Mechanism of Change in Identity Status Processes Over 4 Years in College-Going Emerging Adults	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We examined the critical task of emerging adulthood-identity development-via analyses of trajectories of identity exploration and commitment over the college years, as well as whether narrative processing of important events during this period served as a mechanism of identity exploration and commitment. We took advantage of a unique and comprehensive longitudinal design, which included 12 waves of data, both quantitative and qualitative assessments, collected over 4 years, on two distinct college campuses in the Northwestern and Northeastern regions of the United States (Wave 1, n = 639; growth models using all waves, n = 251). Analyses for this study were preregistered after data collection was complete. We first examined trajectories of exploration and commitment via the dual-cycle identity model. Second, we examined whether exploratory processing in the narration of future self-defining memories at specific waves predicted changes in exploration and commitment in subsequent waves. Findings indicated that exploration and commitment showed trajectories typically viewed as normative (e.g., increasing adaptive forms of exploration and commitment), although trajectories for those at higher socioeconomic statuses differed by showing more exploration and less commitment. We failed to find evidence that exploratory processing predicted changes in exploration and commitment. Implications include distinctions in measurement and theoretical approaches to the study of identity development, the need for greater understanding of what is developing before theorizing how it develops, and the limitations of what is considered normative without attention to structural constraints, such as social class. Public Significance Statement Healthy forms of identity development in college play a critical role in academic success and psychological adjustment. The forms of this development, as well as potential explanations for changes in how one understands the self through college, have been lacking. Findings from our 4-year study show that college students generally explore their options more intensely across this time period and move toward committing to particular identities. However, these trends differed for those who come from higher social class backgrounds, suggesting that the opportunities for self-exploration may be limited by financial resources. Finally, the way college students narrated important events during this time did not predict how much they explored and committed to their identities, leaving open questions about why students move through processes of exploration and commitment during college.

However, the available empirical evidence is inconsistent, leading to substantial uncertainty regarding the cross-lagged relations between SA and SR. This meta-analysis systematically integrates data from 107 longitudinal studies, comprising 110 independent samples and involving a total of 115,133 participants from childhood to adulthood. Four types of SR were assessed: family-related, school-related, romantic, and general relationships. One-stage meta-analytic structural equation modeling was applied to fit four cross-lagged panel models and to test potential moderators. No significant publication bias was detected. Effect size analyses revealed that prior SA significantly and negatively predicted quality of all types of SR. Family-related and general relationships each predicted prospective SA symptoms, but school-related and romantic relationships did not. No moderators were identified in analyses of family-related and romantic relationships. However, the publication year, sample age, gender, reporter, and time lag played a moderating role in analyses of school-related and general relationships. These findings suggest that SA is a crucial factor undermining SR and that dysfunctional family and general relationships also contribute to the exacerbation of SA symptoms. The strengths, limitations, and future directions of this study are discussed. Public Significance Statement A hotly debated issue in academia is whether past social anxiety (SA) hinders future social relationships(SR) or if prior poor SR precipitate subsequent SA symptoms. To shed light on this matter, a comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted, encompassing data from 107 longitudinal studies and involving over 110,000 participants. The findings suggest that SA poses a significant risk to all types of SR, but only family-related and general relationships potentially impacted later levels of SA.

J	Shtulman, A; Goulding, B; Friedman, O				Shtulman, Andrew; Goulding, Brandon; Friedman, Ori			Improbable but Possible: Training Children to Accept the Possibility of Unusual Events	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Young children tend to deny the possibility of events that violate their expectations, including events that are merely improbable, like making onion-flavored ice cream or owning a crocodile as a pet. Could this tendency be countered by teaching children more valid strategies for judging possibility? We explored this question by training children aged 4-12 (n = 128) to consider either the similarity between the target event and unusual events that have actually occurred or causal mechanisms that might bring the target event about. Both trainings increased children's acceptance of improbable events but only for the types of events addressed during training. Older children were more likely to accept improbable events, as were children who scored higher on a measure of cognitive reflection, but neither age nor cognitive reflection moderated the effects of training. These findings indicate that children can use both similarity and causality to assess possibility, but the use of this information is highly circumscribed, further demonstrating how robustly children conflate improbability with impossibility. Public Significance Statement Children tend to claim that unusual events are impossible, and this study explored the source of that tendency by training them to consider real events similar to the target events or mechanisms that cause the target events to occur. We find that both types of information increase children's acceptance of unusual events but only for events similar to those covered during training, which suggests that children appreciate the kinds of considerations relevant to possibility but do not seek out those considerations on their own.

J	Colomer, M; Hwang, HG; Burke, N; Woodward, A				Colomer, Marc; Hwang, Hyesung Grace; Burke, Nicole; Woodward, Amanda			Development of Infants' Preferential Looking Toward Native Language Speakers Across Distinct Social Contexts	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Presenting pictures of faces side by side is a common paradigm to assess infants' attentional biases according to social categories, such as gender, race, and language. However, seeing static faces does not represent infants' typical experience of the social world, which involves people in motion and performing actions. Here, we assessed infants' looking preferences for native over foreign language speakers in two social contexts: the presentation of static faces and the presentation of people performing instrumental actions. In addition, we tested infants' preferential looking at 5 and 9 months of age to assess whether their pattern of preferential looking changes across development. The results of 5-month-old infants replicated and extended previous findings by showing that, at this age, infants typically look longer at people who previously spoke their native language. As found for other social categories such as race and gender, this familiarity-based looking preference was not evident at 9 months of age when infants were presented with static faces. However, when presented with more informative dynamic events, 9-month-old infants showed a temporally aligned preference for the native over the foreign language speaker. Specifically, infants' looking preference was time-locked to the completion of the action goal: when speakers grasped and lifted a toy. These results suggest potentially a familiarity-based preference toward native language speakers around 5 months of age, which may later develop into a more strategic selective response in service of information-seeking.

J	Hassan, R; Schmidt, LA				Hassan, Raha; Schmidt, Louis A.			Shyness and Inhibitory Control in Preschool Dyads: An Actor-Partner Model of Social Behavior	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The risk potentiation model of cognitive control posits that inhibitory control heightens children's risk for problematic outcomes in the context of shyness because it limits shy children's ability to engage flexibly with their environment. Although there is empirical support for the risk potentiation model, most studies have been restricted to parent report of children's outcomes and do not consider the influence of shyness and inhibitory control on other children's social behavior. In the present study, we used an actor-partner interdependence model to examine whether shyness and inhibitory control at Time 1 (N = 105, 52 girls, M-age = 3.50 years; 87% White; M-income = between $75,000 and $100,000 in Canadian dollars) predicted children's own and their partner's observed social behavior with an unfamiliar peer at Time 2 (M-age = 4.76 years). When the child's own inhibitory control was high, the child's own shyness was negatively associated with their own approach behaviors but negatively associated with their partner's avoidance behaviors. However, when the child's own inhibitory control was low, the child's own shyness was unrelated to their own approach behaviors but positively associated with their partner's avoidance behaviors. Although inhibitory control was negatively associated with approach-related behavior for some shy children, this did not translate to more avoidance from the social partner. These results highlight the importance of examining the child's own behavior in addition to their partner's behavior when considering children's socioemotional development.

Neonatal Neural Responses to Novelty Related to Behavioral Inhibition at 1 Year	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Behavioral inhibition (BI), an early-life temperament characterized by vigilant responses to novelty, is a risk factor for anxiety disorders. In this study, we investigated whether differences in neonatal brain responses to infrequent auditory stimuli relate to children's BI at 1 year of age. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we collected blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) data from N = 45 full-term, sleeping neonates during an adapted auditory oddball paradigm and measured BI from n = 27 of these children 1 year later using an observational assessment. Whole-brain analyses corrected for multiple comparisons identified 46 neonatal brain regions producing novelty-evoked BOLD responses associated with children's BI scores at 1 year of age. More than half of these regions (n = 24, 52%) were in prefrontal cortex, falling primarily within regions of the default mode or frontoparietal networks or in ventromedial/orbitofrontal regions without network assignments. Hierarchical clustering of the regions based on their patterns of association with BI resulted in two groups with distinct anatomical, network, and response-timing profiles. The first group, located primarily in subcortical and temporal regions, tended to produce larger early oddball responses among infants with lower subsequent BI. The second group, located primarily in prefrontal cortex, produced larger early oddball responses among infants with higher subsequent BI. These results provide preliminary insights into brain regions engaged by novelty in infants that may relate to later BI. The findings may inform understanding of anxiety disorders and guide future research.

Talk It Out or Tuck It Away: The Contribution of Maternal Socialization of Coping to Depression in Youth With Early Pubertal Maturation	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Theory and research highlight the mismatch between puberty-associated challenges and personal coping resources among youth with early actual or perceived pubertal timing. This study (N = 167; M-age = 12.41 years; 51.5% female; 77.8% White American) examined whether coping resources provided by mothers (maternal socialization of coping) exert protective or exacerbating effects on risk for depression among early-maturing youth. Results revealed that earlier perceived timing predicted higher subsequent depressive symptoms in girls with low (B = .40, SE = .15) but not high (B = -.08, SE = .17) levels of engagement coping suggestions, whereas earlier perceived timing predicted higher subsequent depressive symptoms in boys with high (B = .40, SE = .17) but not low (B = -.12, SE = .15) levels of engagement coping suggestions. These findings build on prior theory and research by highlighting that maternal coping suggestions may mitigate or enhance depression risk in youth who perceive themselves as early maturers; the differential effects in girls and boys suggest that the impact of these suggestions may depend on whether they are in line with gender-specific norms for coping.

Participants included 230 students in Florida (United States; 54.3% girls; ages = 8-13; 39.6% European American, 27.0% Hispanic American, 21.7% African American, and 2.6% Asian American) and 496 students in Lithuania (49.0% girls; ages = 8-14; 358 boys; nearly all ethnic Lithuanian) attending public schools in Florida (United States) and Lithuania. Reciprocated best friends were identified from friend nominations midway through the school year, at which time each partner described perceptions of social support and negativity in the relationship. Of the 363 reciprocated friend dyads, 26.2% (n = 95) were no longer friends 1-3 months later. Dyadic analyses were conducted with initial perceived friend negativity and initial perceived friend social support as predictors of subsequent friendship stability. When considered separately, perceived social support predicted self- and partner reports of friendship stability and perceived negativity predicted self- (but not partner) reports of friendship stability. In each case, lower initial social support and higher initial negativity predicted a greater incidence of friendship dissolution. When considered together, initial perceptions of social support predicted self- and partner reports of friendship dissolution, but perceptions of negativity predicted neither. The findings are consistent with those from married couples, which indicate that the absence of positive interactions is a stronger predictor of relationship instability than the presence of negative interactions.

Inhibited children are more likely to display social withdrawal and experience an increased risk for internalizing problems. Trait inference, the way children interpret behaviors and infer the characteristics of others, may be one potential mechanism. The current study examined the individual differences of BI in trait inference using a cross-sectional design (Study 1, Age 4, N = 80, 38 boys, Chinese) and explored the role of trait inference (Age 4) in relation to early BI (Age 2) and later internalizing behaviors (Age 4) using a longitudinal design (Study 2, N = 163, 93 boys). Trait inference was measured by children's personality judgments after watching four pieces of behavioral information of animated actors in two conditions: a high positive information condition and a high negative information condition. We found that high BI children exhibited a more negative trait inference than low BI children did in two studies, except for the trait inference in the high negative information condition of Study 2. Besides, in Study 2, trait inference in the high positive information condition partially mediated the BI-internalizing behavior link, and such mediation effect was moderated by the level of trait inference. These findings highlight the contribution of social information processing in the social adjustment of children with extreme temperament and have implications for prevention and intervention. Public Significance Statement The present study suggested that children who are temperamentally inhibited show negative trait inferences when judging others based on behavioral information on various situations, and such cognitive process is a crucial mechanism leading to their internalizing behaviors. These findings highlighted the utility of social information processing in understanding the social adjustment of children with extreme temperament.

Debunking the Santa Myth: The Process and Aftermath of Becoming Skeptical About Santa	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Two studies examined the process and aftermath of coming to disbelieve in the myth of Santa Claus. In Study 1, 48 children ages 6-15 answered questions about how they discovered Santa was not real and how the discovery made them feel, and 44 of their parents shared their perspectives and how they promoted Santa. In Study 2, 383 adults reflected on their experiences shifting to disbelief in Santa Claus. In both studies, the average age of disbelief was around 8, but with significant variability. Most participants reported testimony from others contributed to their disbelief, and some reported skepticism as a result of either experience (e.g., observation) or logical reasoning. About a third of children and half of adults reported some negative emotions upon discovering the truth. Higher levels of parental Santa promotion were associated with experiencing some negative emotions upon discovering the truth in both studies. Additionally, adults who reported feeling only negative emotions tended to be older when they discovered the truth, more likely to have reported learning the truth abruptly, and more likely to have reported learning the truth through testimony. That said, experiences of negative emotions were generally short-lived, and the vast majority of both children and adults reported they would celebrate Santa with their own children or were already doing so. Implications of these findings for how to approach children's transition to skepticism regarding Santa are discussed, including timing, the role of parents, and popular notions of discovery for children's trust toward their parents.

Attachment research has been criticized because most studies have been conducted with Western populations. Critics argue this has (a) overemphasized the importance of sensitive responsive caregiving and (b) limited our understanding of multiple nonmaternal caregiving (allomothering). Here, we analyze the extent of sensitive responsiveness and structural properties of allomothering networks among Mbendjele hunter-gatherers who reside in the Republic of Congo. Humans lived as hunter-gatherers for the majority of our evolutionary history, thus studying contemporary hunter-gatherers can offer insight into the caregiving children may be psychologically adapted to. Based on 12-hr focal follows of 18 children (0-4 years old; 10 male), we constructed caregiving networks across the domains of responding to crying, physical contact, interactive care, and proximity. Crying was virtually always responded to rapidly via comforting and never via scolding. Children received physical contact and care for the majority of the day. Allomothering accounted for 40%-50% of caregiving in each domain. While allomaternal networks were large, they were highly concentrated-the majority of a child's allocare was provided by just a few caregivers. Due to high caregiver:child ratios, "sharing" of caregivers was limited-a child typically had several allomothers who directed a majority of their allomaternal effort to him/her. These findings add to our understanding of the level and sources of sensitive responsive caregiving that children may be evolutionarily primed to expect.

Perceived Control Across the Adult Lifespan: Longitudinal Changes in Global Control and Daily Stressor Control	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Perceived control is an important psychosocial resource for health and well-being across the lifespan. Global control (i.e., overall perceived control) decreases over time in studies following people every few years to upwards of 10 years. Changes across wider intervals of the lifespan, however, have yet to be examined. Further, how perceived control changes for specific aspects of daily life, such as stressors, remains comparatively less clear. Using data from the Midlife in the United States National Study of Daily Experiences (NSDE, N = 1,940, M = 56.25 years, SD = 12.20, 57% female), we examined longitudinal changes in global control across 20 years and daily stressor control across 10 years. Global control was assessed in the first wave of the NSDE (similar to 1996). In follow-up waves, conducted in similar to 2008 and similar to 2017, participants again not only reported their global control but also reported their perceived control over stressors they experience across 8 consecutive days. Longitudinal analyses revealed differential change trajectories for global control across 20 years and stressor control across 10 years (ps < .001). Global control declined for younger and older adults but stayed relatively stable for individuals in midlife. The rate of decline in daily stressor control was steeper than the decline in global control and did not vary by age at baseline. In addition, declines were amplified among individuals with higher global control at baseline. Results suggest that daily stressor control is a specific aspect of control beliefs that follows a different rate of change than global control. Public Significance Statement Global control and control over stressful experiences in daily life change over time but in distinct ways. Analyses from a large national sample with up to 20 years of longitudinal follow-up suggests that global control declines in younger and older adults but stays relatively stable among individuals in midlife. Control over specific aspects of daily life, in contrast, declines at a similar rate across younger, middle-aged, and older adults.

Exploring Maternal and Child Perceptions of Children's Anxiety Longitudinally	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The goals of this study were to investigate (a) the dyadic relations of mothers' and children's perceptions of children's anxiety symptoms across development, (b) whether maternal perceptions of children's anxiety serve as a mediator of the association between maternal anxiety and child anxiety, and (c) whether sensitive/structured parenting moderates these processes. Participants were 180 mother-child dyads (96 female) recruited from Quebec, Canada, and assessed in preschool, middle childhood, and early adolescence. Mothers and children completed questionnaires on children's anxiety, and mothers additionally completed a questionnaire on their own anxiety. Maternal sensitivity/structuring was assessed from an observed interaction task. Results from an actor-partner interdependence model suggest (a) maternal perceptions of children's anxiety in middle childhood predict children's self-perceptions in adolescence, but not vice versa; (b) maternal perceptions in middle childhood mediate the link between maternal anxiety in early childhood and child self-perceptions of anxiety in adolescence; and (c) the indirect effect of maternal perceptions is moderated by maternal sensitivity/structuring such that mothers who perceived more anxiety in their children and who were observed to show lower levels of sensitivity/structuring in middle childhood tended to have children who perceived more anxiety in adolescence. Findings suggest that maternal awareness of children's anxiety may be one mechanism, in the presence of relationships characterized by lower levels of sensitivity, through which anxiety risk is transferred from parent to child over time.					serbin, lisa/F-3979-2011														0012-1649	1939-0599				JAN	2024	60	1					187	198		10.1037/dev0001646	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001646		NOV 2023						37917488					WOS:001108517600001
J	Hildebrand, L; Cordes, S				Hildebrand, Lindsey; Cordes, Sara			Children Underperform Following "Math" but Not "Spatial" Task Framing	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Increasing evidence suggests that success in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields is not only dependent upon one's actual STEM-relevant abilities but also upon one's STEM-relevant attitudes-in particular, math and spatial attitudes. Here, we examine whether simply mentioning the math or spatial relevance of a task affects children's performance and the moderating role of children's math and spatial attitudes. Further, we examine gender differences in performance given pervasive gender gaps in STEM and early-emerging gender differences in math and spatial attitudes. Participants (221 first- to fourth-grade children from the United States; 113 girls, 108 boys; 52% White, 16% Black, 14% Asian, 9% Hispanic or Latinx, 18% multiple races/ethnicities) were introduced to a novel task framed as tapping into math or spatial abilities (or no framing [control condition]). Children then completed math and spatial anxiety and self-concept measures. Results indicate that children who heard the math task framing were less accurate relative to children in the control condition, and the effect was larger for those with higher math anxiety or lower math self-concept, but it was not different for boys and girls. Children who heard the spatial task framing, however, performed comparably to children in the control condition. Though both math and spatial attitudes revealed identical patterns of gender differences (with higher anxiety and lower self-concept in girls than boys), there were no gender differences in performance. This study highlights the salient role of math attitudes early in development and provides key insights for future work aimed at increasing STEM outcomes.

J	Zelazo, PR				Zelazo, Philip R.			Schema Formation and Stimulus-Schema Discrepancy: A Basic Unit and Its Properties	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Research with 2-day-old neonates shows that they create mental representations-schemata-for their experiences and that this cognitive ability is hardwired and functional at birth. This research and studies with older infants indicate that both the formation and the expansion of schemata occur through moderate discrepancies, a concept that Jerome Kagan promoted conceptually and through his research. Discrepancy, as distinct from novelty, is insufficiently acknowledged in the literature on schema theory. The schema is both cognitive and affective and develops in unison in a curvilinear pattern with a gradual onset and exponential expansion. Optimal attentiveness and positive affect occur at the peak of formation and to moderate discrepancies. Redundancy beyond the optimal level produces decreasing interest and positive affect and increasing negative affect resulting in boredom and avoidance. These characteristics of schema development are difficult to study with older children and adults. Rumelhart (1980) regarded the schema as the "building block of cognition" and Kagan (2002) called its expansion through moderate discrepancies an "engine of change" implying widespread application for cognition and behavior throughout life. Kagan urged the search for structure (form) as opposed to function in cognition, and the curvilinear pattern of schema development and its characteristics, it is argued, is the structure he sought. Implications and select applications of schema development and expansion are presented.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				2023 NOV 2	2023										10.1037/dev0001643	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001643		NOV 2023						37917486					WOS:001108516200001

The Developmental Context of Culture: Reflections on the Contributions and Legacy of Jerome Kagan	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Although the path of Kagan's career led him inexorably toward biology, in the few years between his first benchmark publication on infancy and his later focus on temperament, he turned to other cultures in order to evaluate emerging insights about early development, namely, that major developmental transitions in behavior are maturational products. These forays contributed profoundly to our current understanding of culture and human development and inspired several of his students to focus their own careers on human development in culture, or, turned around, what we might call the developmental context of culture. Drawing largely on Kagan's own writings, this essay attempts to understand what the cross-cultural work meant to him and its lasting influence on his students.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				2023 NOV 2	2023										10.1037/dev0001645	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001645		NOV 2023						37917491					WOS:001108528800001

When the talker spoke in the children's native language, monolinguals attended equally to the eyes and mouth throughout the trial, whereas close-language bilinguals first attended more to the mouth and then distributed attention equally between the eyes and mouth. In contrast, when the talker spoke in a nonnative language (English), both monolinguals and bilinguals initially attended more to the mouth and then gradually shifted to a pattern of equal attention to the eyes and mouth. These results indicate that specific early linguistic experience has differential effects on young children's deployment of selective attention to areas of a talker's face during the initial part of an audiovisual utterance.

Data for this study came from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development and included a sample of 1,364 participants (52% male) born in 1991 and followed through age 26. Results indicated that early cumulative risk was related to depression and risky behavior at age 15 as well as depression, income, future orientation, and educational attainment at age 26. Furthermore, both EF and behavioral regulation mediated relations among cumulative risk and academic achievement at age 15 and between cumulative risk and income and educational attainment at age 26. Finally, three significant interactions emerged for age 15 outcomes, indicating that EF and behavioral regulation may change relations between cumulative risk and depression, reading, and future orientation. Implications for future research are discussed.

Children (N = 134, M-age = 8.70 years) were assigned randomly to the three training groups: (a) metacognitive training of basic EF processes (meta-EF), (b) training of basic EF processes (basic-EF), and (c) active controls (active control). They underwent 16 training sessions over the course of 2 months. No effects of EF and/or metacognitive training were found for academic outcomes. However, both meta-EF and basic-EF groups demonstrated greater gains than the active control group on proactive control engagement and WM, suggesting that EF training promotes a shift to more mature ways of engaging EF. Our findings suggest minimal near- and far-transfer effects of metacognitive training but highlight that proactive engagement of EF can be promoted through EF training in children.

Both abilities develop throughout childhood and are known to contribute to social behavior and academic performance in young adolescents. Notably, mentalizing and EF activate shared frontotemporal brain areas, which in previous studies of adults led researchers to suggest that at least some aspects of empathy depend on intact EF mechanisms. Despite the substantial development that empathy and EF undergo during adolescence, no study to date has systematically examined the associations between components of empathy and EF in this age group. Here, we explore these associations using data from an online battery of tasks, collected as part of a longitudinal twin study (N = 593; M(ag)e 11.09 +/- 0.2; 53.46% female, Israeli adolescents from Jewish decent). Using a confirmatory factor analysis, we quantified the associations between the main components of empathy (mentalizing and interpersonal concern) and of EF (working memory [WM], inhibition and shifting [IaS]). We found that WM was related to both mentalizing and interpersonal concern, whereas IaS were related to mentalizing but not to interpersonal concern. We also discuss the genetic and environmental contributions to individual differences in each factor. Our findings show both similarities and differences from previous findings in adults, suggesting that the ongoing brain maturation processes and environmental age-dependent experiences in adolescence may affect the developing relation between cognitive and emotional development. These results have implications for better understanding and treating clinical populations demonstrating executive or emotional deficits, specifically during adolescence.

Data from 1,639 children (44.36% girls) ages 6-13 years were drawn from the Children School Functions and Brain Development project. Executive function components were assessed by the cancellation test, the Corsi test, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. Psychiatric problems were determined by parent report. All assessments were administered twice, separated by a 1-year interval. Cross-lagged panel models showed that cognitive flexibility and general psychiatric problems (general p) mutually predicted each other. Worse inhibitory control at baseline significantly predicted more externalizing problems 1 year later, regardless of age, while externalizing problems did not significantly predict inhibitory control 1 year later. Working memory at baseline did not significantly predict internalizing problems and vice versa. These findings demonstrate that better inhibitory control may help to prevent or reduce externalizing problems in Chinese school-age children and that higher cognitive flexibility may help to mitigate general psychiatric problems.

To investigate the attention bias for emotional versus neutral faces, an eye-tracking measurement and free viewing of paired pictures of facial expressions (i.e., happy, fearful, sad, or angry faces) and nonface pictures with neutral faces were conducted with 367 children participating in a Finnish cohort study at the age of 2.5 years and with 477 children at the age of 5 years, 216 of which having follow-up measurements. We found an attention-orienting bias for happy and fearful faces versus neutral faces at both age points. An attention-orienting bias for sad faces emerged between 2.5 and 5 years. In addition, there were significant biases in sustained attention toward happy, fearful, sad, and angry faces versus neutral faces, with a bias in sustained attention for fearful faces being the strongest. All biases in sustained attention increased between 2.5 and 5 years of age. Moderate correlations in saccadic latencies were found between 2.5 and 5 years. In conclusion, attention biases for emotional facial expressions seem to be age-specific and specific for the attentional subcomponent. This implies that future studies on affect-biased attention during the preschool years should use small age ranges and cover multiple subcomponents of attention.

Depends on Where They Live and How Their Social World Is Structured	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												By 4 years of age, White children from across the United States begin to exhibit an awareness of racial inequalities, along with in-group preferences for other White children. The present study explored how the size and racial diversity of White children's social network (e.g., friends, family, and classmates) and neighborhood (zip code) are related to variation in their explanations for racial disparities and anti-Black bias among a sample of 395 White children (ages = 4-11 years old; M-age = 6.6 years) from 263 unique zip codes across the United States. White children in neighborhoods with low diversity were more likely to endorse an extrinsic explanation for racial inequality as their network diversity increased, whereas network diversity did not relate to children's choices for those who lived in neighborhoods with high diversity. These findings held even after controlling for parents' beliefs about diversity, which were themselves positively correlated with children's network and neighborhood diversity. An exploratory analysis revealed that for White children in small networks only, as the number of children of color in their network increased, they were more likely to choose to play with a Black child. Results demonstrate how the diversity of children's social networks and neighborhoods relates to children's developing racial beliefs in contextually dependent ways.

Fostering School Equity: A Racial Socialization Approach to Creating an Equitable School Climate and Reducing Disciplinary Infractions	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Despite numerous efforts to attenuate the Black-White discipline gap in U.S. schools, Black students are still suspended for minor infractions at a disproportionately higher rate than their White peers. Using a racially diverse sample (n = 1,515; M-age = 12.7; 50% boys; 72% Black, 28% White), this 3-year longitudinal study examined whether student perceptions of school racial socialization practices (i.e., cultural socialization, promotion of cultural competence) were linked to a lower likelihood of receiving a suspension for a minor infraction through improved school climate perceptions and whether these links differed between Black and White students. Results showed that school racial socialization was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving a suspension for a minor infraction and improved school climate perceptions for all students. Moreover, students' perceptions of school climate mediated the link between school racial socialization and suspensions among both Black and White students. Considering these results, school racial socialization is a promising means for improving students' school climate perceptions, reducing inequitable disciplinary practices, and fostering school equity.

Moving Beyond "Nouns in the Lab": Using Naturalistic Data to Understand Why Infants' First Words Include <i>Uh-Oh</i> and <i>Hi</i>	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Why do infants learn some words earlier than others? Many theories of early word learning focus on explaining how infants map labels onto concrete objects. However, words that are more abstract than object nouns, such as uh-oh, hi, more, up, and all-gone, are typically among the first to appear in infants' vocabularies. We combined a behavioral experiment with naturalistic observational research to explore how infants learn and represent this understudied category of high-frequency, routine-based non-nouns, which we term "everyday words." In Study 1, we found that a conventional eye-tracking measure of comprehension was insufficient to capture U.S.-based English-learning 10- to 16-month-old infants' emerging understanding of everyday words. In Study 2, we analyzed the visual and social scenes surrounding caregivers' and infants' use of everyday words in a naturalistic video corpus. This ecologically motivated research revealed that everyday words rarely co-occurred with consistent visual referents, making their early learnability difficult to reconcile with dominant word learning theories. Our findings instead point to complex patterns in the types of situations associated with everyday words that could contribute to their early representation in infants' vocabularies. By leveraging both experimental and observational methods, this investigation underscores the value of using naturalistic data to broaden theories of early learning.

The present investigation assessed honesty promotion techniques for encouraging 3-8-year-old Canadian children's (Study 1: n = 301, 54% female; Study 2: n = 229, 50% female from predominantly White middle-class samples) disclosure of a transgression and whether they varied by age. Study 1 examined promising to tell the truth, inducing self-awareness, and the combination of both promising and self-awareness. Study 2 assessed modeling honesty, positive consequences of honesty, and the combination of modeling and consequences. Some individual techniques worked for specific age groups: Self-awareness only increased 3-4-year-olds' and promising only increased 7-8-year-olds' honesty. However, the combination of modeling and consequences increased honesty for all age groups. Findings suggest that different motivational factors may encourage children's honesty across childhood.

Rethinking Household Size and Children's Language Environment	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The number of U.S. children living in households with extended families has greatly increased in the last 4 decades. This demographic shift calls for a reevaluation of the impact of household size on children's development. Household density (HHD), measured as the ratio of people to bedrooms in a home, has been shown to negatively relate to children's language. Here, we propose that while greater HHD may result in poorer language abilities, more adults in relation to the number of children in the home may have a positive impact on children's language. To test this hypothesis, we studied relations between HHD and adult-to-child ratio with children's vocabulary scores, as well as whether maternal education and household chaos accounted for these associations. Participants included families from a range of socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds (N = 275; M-age = 10.85; 51% female; 51% Hispanic; annual income range less than $10,000-over $100,000). In general, higher HHD was related to lower child vocabulary scores. Conversely, higher adult-to-child ratio was related to higher child vocabulary and lower household chaos. These patterns were primarily driven by effects in Hispanic families. Our results suggest that a reevaluation of household size is needed, as more adults in the home can be protective for children's language development in larger families, an effect that may vary by culture.

Response Bias Is Genetically Biased: Another Argument for Kagan's Philippic Against Questionnaires in Developmental Psychology	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												One of the concerns of Jerome Kagan (2007) in his article "A Trio of Concerns" was the frequent use of questionnaires in developmental psychology and related disciplines. His main reasons were the minimal overlap between (self-)reported and observed phenotypes, the ambiguity of items, and systematic socioeconomic status (SES) disparities in responding. We wondered whether genetic differences would also influence response bias in cases of ambiguous or even absurd items triggering an acquiescence bias to agree with even impossible question content. We examined the genetic predisposition for the acquiescence response bias in 257 families with twins. Both parents and twins completed a modified Wildman Symptoms Questionnaire and provided salivary DNA samples. From published genome-wide association studies (GWAS), we derived polygenic score (PGS) algorithms for indicators of SES (educational attainment [EA] and income) and for general intelligence (IQ), which were applied to the GWAS results of our participants' DNA. The twins (N = 514 children, 55% monozygotic pairs) were on average 7.92 years old (SD = 0.66), and 51.6% were female. The primary parents were on average 40.48 years old (SD = 4.66), and 91% were female. In 90% of the families, both parents were born in the Netherlands and 91% were from a middle or higher socioeconomic background. Higher PGSs for EA and income but not for IQ predicted less acquiescence response bias in parents and children. In addition to Kagan's reasons for his concerns about questionnaires, we found a genetic predisposition to response bias triggered by the ambiguous form of questions and answers.					van IJzendoorn, Marinus/P-4907-2019	Runze, Jana/0000-0003-1792-3357													0012-1649	1939-0599				2023 OCT 30	2023										10.1037/dev0001614	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001614		OCT 2023						37902678					WOS:001108529300001
J	Weiss, EM				Weiss, Emily M.			Self-Regulation in Elementary School: Do Teacher-Reported Effortful Control and Directly Assessed Executive Function Codevelop?	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Self-regulation (SR) is a central developmental task of early childhood and is considered essential for children's success during elementary school. It has typically been conceptualized as effortful control (EC) or executive function (EF), drawing respectively on research traditions in temperament and cognitive development. These aspects of SR are theorized to emerge from an intertwined developmental process, but the nature of their relation throughout elementary school has not been established. In particular, it is not known whether ratings given by teachers based on behavioral observations align with those directly assessed via novel performance tasks. This article addresses this gap in the knowledge by examining the codevelopment of EC and EF with regard to intraindividual trajectories of change. Drawing on a national sample (N = 8,742) from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort of 2010-2011, two longitudinal modeling approaches (parallel-process latent growth curves with structured residuals, Curran et al., 2014; multidimensional growth mixture models, Wickrama et al., 2021) were applied to examine children's SR between second and fifth grade. Overall, results do not reveal a systematic codevelopmental relation between EC and EF when accounting for intraindividual processes. Findings are discussed with regard to developmental theory and application.

J	Petersen, IT				Petersen, Isaac T.			Reexamining Developmental Continuity and Discontinuity in the 21st Century: Better Aligning Behaviors, Functions, and Mechanisms	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Developmental science aims to explain development across the lifespan. Jerome Kagan observed that the same behavior can occur for different reasons, and differing behaviors can occur for the same reason. To help account for persistence, desistence, and transformation of behavior across development, Kagan introduced various types of continuity and discontinuity of forms and functions of behavior. This framework provides opportunities for identifying explanatory mechanisms in behavior development. However, misconceptions remain in applying the concepts that Kagan introduced. Much of the literature assumes developmental continuity in constructs without examining whether assumptions are supported, leading to faulty developmental inferences. For instance, the use of the same measure across time to assess development assumes that the behavior occurs for the same reason across time (homotypic continuity). In addition, just because one behavior predicts a different behavior at a later time does not necessarily indicate that age-differing behaviors occur for the same reason (heterotypic continuity). This review aims to advance conceptualizations of continuity and discontinuity from a contemporary perspective with aims to improve mechanistic understanding of behavior development across the lifespan. To better align behaviors, functions, and mechanisms, research should (a) examine (dis)continuity of individual behaviors rather than merely syndromes, (b) identify the function(s) of the given behavior(s), and (c) identify the cognitive and biological processes that underlie the behavior-function pairs. Incorporating examples from research on development of humans and nonhuman animals, I discuss challenges from work that has followed Kagan's ideas and ways to advance understanding of continuity and discontinuity across development.

Supporting Latine Children's Informal Engineering Learning Through Tinkering and Oral Storytelling	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Providing equitable informal science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning opportunities to young children from diverse backgrounds may be a way to increase access and interest in STEM and can help to address the broader goal of increasing representation. Importantly, these learning experiences must be meaningful and engage everyday cultural practices. Guided by a strengths-based approach, the current study examines how oral stories as a cultural resource can be harnessed to support Latine children's engagement in a tinkering activity. The project explores whether and how setting an at-home tinkering activity within a story context engenders rich parent-child conversations that provide engineering learning opportunities for young children. Fifty-two Latine parents and children (M-age = 7.69 years; 23 girls; 90.4% Mexican heritage) were randomly assigned to either hear a story as a frame for a hands-on tinkering activity or to engage in the same tinkering activity without the story. After families finished tinkering, a researcher elicited the children's reflections about their tinkering experience. Approximately 2 weeks after the activity, children were asked to share their tinkering reflections with a second researcher. Parents and children in the story condition talked more about engineering during tinkering, and these children also talked more about engineering during both reflections than did children in the no-story condition. These findings suggest that integrating oral storytelling into tinkering activities is a promising future direction for the creation of more equitable informal engineering learning opportunities for Latine children and families.

Here, we systematically examined children's use of epistemic states to make diagnostic social inferences. Specifically, we investigated children's group membership inferences based on what others do and do not know and what role children's own knowledge states and the type of knowledge play in these inferences. Across two preregistered studies, 7- and 8-year-old children (N = 100) were shown targets who were knowledgeable (Study 1) or ignorant (Study 2) of familiar and unfamiliar knowledge items that were either general or culture-specific and asked to guess whether the targets would be linguistic ingroup or outgroup members. Children inferred that the targets would speak their native language if they shared targets' epistemic states and a foreign language if they did not. Importantly, these patterns were particularly evident when epistemic states involved cultural knowledge. Further, children's inferences became more nuanced with age. These findings suggest that others' knowledge states are socially meaningful in childhood and children use their own and others' epistemic states in flexible ways to guide their diagnostic social judgments.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the predictive value of finger gnosia and FMS to enumeration, cardinal, and arithmetical abilities and how these different dimensions contribute to arithmetic development. Overall, 3- to 5-year-old preschoolers were asked to perform tasks assessing enumeration, cardinality, and early arithmetic, as well as finger gnosia and FMS. FMS, involving either static or dynamic fine finger movement, were examined using 3D motion analyses. Using hierarchical regression, FMS were found to be the best predictor of both cardinality and early arithmetic skills, while finger gnosia did not predict the additional variance of arithmetic performance when FMS and age were considered in the regression model. Moreover, neither finger gnosia nor FMS were significant predictors of enumeration. Mediation analyses indicated that knowledge of the cardinal principle fully mediates the relationship between FMS and arithmetic skills, suggesting that FMS contribute to cardinal principle knowledge development, which would be a gateway to more complex arithmetical processing.

A Unified Approach to Demographic Data Collection for Research With Young Children Across Diverse Cultures	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Culture is a key determinant of children's development both in its own right and as a measure of generalizability of developmental phenomena. Studying the role of culture in development requires information about participants' demographic backgrounds. However, both reporting and treatment of demographic data are limited and inconsistent in child development research. A barrier to reporting demographic data in a consistent fashion is that no standardized tool currently exists to collect these data. Variation in cultural expectations, family structures, and life circumstances across communities make the creation of a unifying instrument challenging. Here, we present a framework to standardize demographic reporting for early child development (birth to 3 years of age), focusing on six core sociodemographic construct categories: biological information, gestational status, health status, community of descent, caregiving environment, and socioeconomic status. For each category, we discuss potential constructs and measurement items and provide guidance for their use and adaptation to diverse contexts. These items are stored in an open repository of context-adapted questionnaires that provide a consistent approach to obtaining and reporting demographic information so that these data can be archived and shared in a more standardized format.

B.; Bird, Amy			Maternal Reminiscing During Middle Childhood: Associations With Maternal Personality and Child Temperament From the <i>Growing Up in New Zealand</i> Cohort Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The way that mothers talk about the past (reminisce) with young children is linked to key memory, language, and socioemotional outcomes. The present research explored the role of a range of child, maternal, socioeconomic, and cultural factors that predict maternal reminiscing style, with a particular focus on maternal personality and child temperament. A total of 1,404 mother-child dyads from the prebirth longitudinal cohort study Growing Up in New Zealand (https://www.growingup.co.nz) participated in a reminiscing task about a negative event when children were 8 years old. This broader cohort is broadly representative of the New Zealand population in terms of maternal ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Conversations were scored using a revised version of the Elaborative Reminiscing Scale. Child temperament during infancy, but not childhood, uniquely predicted maternal reminiscing style. Maternal extraversion also predicted a more elaborative reminiscing style. Other maternal factors, including education, ethnicity, and age, were also identified as unique predictors of maternal reminiscing style. These findings fit well with an ecological systems view of maternal reminiscing as a function of child, maternal, and cultural factors. Public Significance Statement These findings suggest that mothers differ in their style of reminiscing with their children based on a number of individual and sociocultural factors, including the mother's personality and the child's temperament. Further research on the directionality of the relationship between reminiscing and child temperament may inform the development of reminiscing coaching programs for parents.

How Children Miss the Forest for the Trees in Spatial Navigation	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Unlike children's early ability to navigate by continuous boundaries, their ability to extract geometric information from an array of objects emerges gradually over childhood. To investigate children's developing representation of object arrays for navigation and its relation to their mental representation of the global spatial layout, reorientation behavior was tested in 146 children (4-9 years, 78 male children and 68 female children, Italian) with rectangular arrays made up of 20 objects. Posttest questions on children's spatial language and their mental and pictorial representation of the environment were administered. Although children of all ages navigated by the geometry of continuous boundary-like arrays, they only succeeded with separated object arrays at around 7 years of age. This developmental change was predicted by children's individual ability to extract the abstract geometry of the spatial layout in a two-dimensional picture of the room.

The current study examined one of the ways that pets may change the environment through which children learn and whether childhood pet ownership might promote empathy and prosocial behavior through parent-child conversations about emotions and mental states in the presence of a pet dog. Participants included 123 parent (118 mothers, four fathers) and child (65 female, 58 male, M-age = 39.50 months, 75 White, not Hispanic, nine Asian/Pacific Islander, seven Hispanic, five Black/African American, two South Asian/Indian, two American Indian/Alaska Native, two "other," 21 more than one race, 111 residing in the United States) dyads currently living with a pet dog (n = 61) or having never lived with a pet dog (n = 62). As hypothesized, we found that parents used a greater proportion of emotion and mental state language with their children when playing with their pet dog than with a lifelike toy, suggesting that the presence of a household pet may be one context used to promote conversations about emotions and mental states.

How Biology Shapes the Development of Shyness Within Specific Contexts: A Longitudinal, Cross-Lagged Investigation	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Shyness is a temperamental trait that refers to fear and wariness in the face of social novelty and is known to have a biological basis. One proposed physiological correlate of shyness has been the change in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) from baseline to a stressor. However, past research linking shyness and RSA change has been mixed, which may be, in part, due to a failure to carefully consider the context under which RSA change is measured and the directionality of relations. Using a longitudinal design and cross-lagged analysis (N = 103, 52 girls), we examined parent-reported shyness and RSA change during a stranger approach task (social stressor) and a locked box task (nonsocial stressor) at ages 3 (M-age at Time 1 = 3.50 years, SDage = 0.19 years) and 4 (M-age at Time 2 = 4.76 years, SDage = 0.38). Cardiac vagal withdrawal during the stranger approach task, but not during the frustration task, at age 3 positively predicted shyness at age 4. Shyness at age 3 did not predict cardiac vagal change in either context at age 4. We also found that changes in RSA measured during the frustration task were stable across time, but changes in RSA measured during the stranger approach task were not stable across time, suggesting a developmental change in physiological regulatory systems to social threat. These results suggest that, although biology may come first in shaping children's behavior, this relation depends critically on the context and the incentives in the child's environment.

It is often assumed that peer victimization is associated with fewer psychological problems in classrooms where defending victims of bullying is common (i.e., a norm). The few studies testing this claim have been cross-sectional and have produced mixed findings. The current preregistered study examined whether the prospective link between victimization and psychological adjustment (i.e., depressive symptoms and self-esteem) was moderated by classroom defending norms. Moreover, we aimed to explain why defending norms may have either beneficial or adverse effects on victims' adjustment, by focusing on two cognitive processes: victims' causal attributions and social comparisons. Three waves of data were collected among 3,470 Finnish fourth- to ninth-grade students from 227 classrooms (M-age = 13.04, 50.1% girls). Multilevel regression analyses showed that nonvictimized youth benefited from high defending norms, whereas victims' psychological adjustment did not vary as a function of defending norms. Therefore, no mediation analyses were conducted. Nonpreregistered additional analyses indicated that stable victims had greater psychological problems and higher self-blame over time in classrooms with higher defending norms. Thus, even though the majority of students seem to profit from defending norms, this might not be true for those who most urgently need help.

Employment Status and Psychosocial Adjustment Among Adolescents and Parents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Multi-Informant Data From Ecological Momentary Assessments	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												During the COVID-19 pandemic, many families experienced financial and health stressors associated with parental employment. Using multi-informant and daily-diary data from a nationwide U.S. sample of parents and children (626 dyads; 18,780 daily assessments across 30 days: May 18, 2020-June 1, 2020, October 19, 2020-November 2, 2020; parents: M-age = 43, 15% male; children: M-age = 15, 42% male; 36% Black, 26% White, 14% multiracial, 12% Latinx, 11% Asian American, and 1% Native American), this intensive longitudinal study investigated (a) the mediating role of health stress and financial stress in the link between parental employment status and psychosocial adjustment among adolescents and their parents and (b) whether this link differed by families' socioeconomic status or receipt of government subsidies. Results indicated that families who experienced job loss tended to report higher levels of health stress and financial stress, which in turn was associated with heightened negative affect and poorer sleep quality for both parents and adolescents. When parents work from home (WFH), families tended to have lower levels of health stress and financial stress, which in turn weakened the positive links with negative affect and sleep quality. Lower- (vs. higher-) income families experienced weaker protective effects associated with WFH arrangements. Government subsidies were associated with lower stress and better psychosocial outcomes in families experiencing job loss.

Tracking Informal Fraction Knowledge and Its Correlates Across First Grade	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Young children have informal knowledge of fractions before learning about fraction symbols in school. In the current study, we followed 103 children in the Mid-Atlantic United States from the fall to the spring of first grade to characterize the development of individual differences in early informal fraction knowledge, as well as its relation to other mathematical and cognitive skills. Most children in our sample showed some early fraction knowledge at the beginning of first grade, especially with nonsymbolic fractions and halving, and this knowledge improved over the school year without explicit instruction in fractions. However, there were large individual differences in early fraction knowledge at the start of first grade, which explained significant variance in math achievement at the end of first grade, even when controlling for whole number knowledge and a variety of cognitive skills. Start-of-year whole number knowledge, but not spatial scaling or proportional reasoning, also predicted early end-of-year fraction knowledge. These data can inform activities for learning in the early years to foster both early fraction and integer knowledge in parallel, which may better prepare students for later formal instruction in fractions.

J	Viegut, AA; Matthews, PG				Viegut, Alexandria A.; Matthews, Percival G.			Building Fraction Magnitude Knowledge With Number Lines: Partitioning Versus Analogy	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Understanding fraction magnitudes is foundational for later math achievement. To represent a fraction x/y, children are often taught to use partitioning: Break the whole into y parts and shade in x parts. Past research has shown that partitioning on number lines supports children's fraction magnitude knowledge more than partitioning on area models. However, partitioning may not take full advantage of children's prior knowledge or the structure of the number line. We tested an alternative fraction number line lesson that leveraged children's preexisting whole number knowledge using a domain-general learning tool: analogy. In a preregistered online experiment, second and third graders (N = 84, M = 8.83 years) were randomly assigned to an analogy lesson (e.g., if I know how big 3 is on a 0-4 line, I know how big 3/4 is on a 0-1 line), a partitioning lesson on number lines, or a control lesson using square area models. Results showed that the analogy lesson was more effective for promoting fraction magnitude understanding than the control lesson, and it was at least as effective as the partitioning lesson. The analogy group, but not the partitioning group, significantly outperformed the control group with large-denominator fractions at retention (i.e., 1-week delayed posttest) and on transfer tests (i.e., fraction comparison). We also replicated past findings that fraction partitioning lessons are more effective on number lines than on area models, and this advantage was partially sustained after a 1-week delay. Overall, these findings highlight the power of domain-general analogy to support mathematical development.

J	Attout, L; Monnier, C				Attout, Lucie; Monnier, Catherine			Evidence of a Positive Effect of Verbal Cumulative Rehearsal on Serial Order Working Memory, as Early as 4 Years Old	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The use of a verbal rehearsal strategy (repeating the items to be remembered to oneself in serial order) has been identified as a key factor in explaining working memory (WM) development. However, the debate remains open with regard to the age at which children are able to use it, and the actual benefits of using such a strategy. Numerous methodological constraints to identify WM strategies limit the interpretation of current findings reported in the literature. Moreover, the sequential nature of the cumulative rehearsal strategy means that its use may have a particular influence on maintaining serial order information. The present study aimed to examine (a) whether children aged 4, 5, and 6 (n = 74, 39 female, n = 61, 29 female, and n = 72, 29 female, respectively) were able to implement an instructed verbal rehearsal strategy and (b) the benefits of using such a strategy in terms of WM performance. Specifically, we invited children to use cumulative rehearsal, naming (simple rehearsal), or no strategy when performing verbal WM tasks (immediate serial recall and item and order serial recognition). Moreover, the specific influence of instructed strategies on item and serial order maintenance was assessed in the different age groups. While the benefits of using the naming strategy were limited, cumulative rehearsal instruction increased WM performance in all age groups, particularly for serial order information. Our results demonstrate that, as early as 4 years old, children were able to implement, and benefit from a short period of cumulative rehearsal instruction.

Developmental Changes in Drawing Production Under Different Memory Demands in a US and Chinese Sample	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Children's drawings of common object categories become dramatically more recognizable across childhood. What are the major factors that drive developmental changes in children's drawings? To what degree are children's drawings a product of their changing internal category representations versus limited by their visuomotor abilities or their ability to recall the relevant visual information? To explore these questions, we examined the degree to which developmental changes in drawing recognizability vary across different drawing tasks that vary in memory demands (i.e., drawing from verbal vs. picture cues) and with children's shape-tracing abilities across two geographical locations (San Jose, United States, and Beijing, China). We collected digital shape tracings and drawings of common object categories (e.g., cat, airplane) from 4- to 9-year-olds (N = 253). The developmental trajectory of drawing recognizability was remarkably similar when children were asked to draw from pictures versus verbal cues and across these two geographical locations. In addition, our Beijing sample produced more recognizable drawings but showed similar tracing abilities to children from San Jose. Overall, this work suggests that the developmental trajectory of children's drawings is remarkably consistent and not easily explainable by changes in visuomotor control or working memory; instead, changes in children's drawings over development may at least partly reflect changes in the internal representations of object categories.

The first goal of the current study was to identify latent subgroups of children characterized by different developmental trajectories of cognitive flexibility throughout kindergarten and first grade using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 2010-2011 dataset. The second goal was to examine whether identified longitudinal developmental trajectories of cognitive flexibility could be associated with internalizing and externalizing behaviors in the second grade, while accounting for background child (age, gender, and Spanish-speaking) and family (family income and mother's education) covariates. The analytic sample consisted of 15,827 kindergarteners (51.20% male; 48.50% White, 13.5% Black/African American, 24.3% Hispanic/Latino, 7.60% Asian, and 6.1% other), who were approximately 5.62 years old (SD = 4.48 months) at the study's outset. Most children lived in households with medium family income of approximately $50,000-$55,000. Using a growth mixture modeling approach, our analyses identified normative (91.05%; 50.4% male) and delayed (8.95%; 59.4% male) cognitive flexibility groups and demonstrated that delayed developers have higher levels of externalizing and internalizing behaviors in the second grade, even after adjusting for background covariates. Our findings, in conjunction with research on cognitive flexibility training, suggest that caregivers may lower the risk for externalizing and internalizing behaviors in delayed developers by correcting inflexible thinking, encouraging alternative solutions, and providing emotional support when children face challenging problems.

An ex-Gaussian approach was employed on stop signal task data to distinctly examine for the first time how mean and intra individual variability measures of inhibitory control are modulated at different time spans of development and neutral and socio affective contexts. Results show a combination of adolescent-emergent, adolescent-specific, and adult-emergent patterns for distinct ex-Gaussian measures of cool, hot-positive, and hot-negative inhibition performance, suggesting a much more complex account of inhibitory control development than previously believed.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				OCT	2023	59	10					1807	1822		10.1037/dev0001606	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001606								37768616					WOS:001133172400013

Specifically, the idea is that children with higher negative emotionality, surgency, and lower effortful control are more affected by their received parenting, but experimental evidence is scarce. Also, others have argued that child temperament might not be a susceptibility factor but a factor that can change through parents' participation in a parenting intervention. To test both hypotheses, we analyzed pretest, posttest, and 4-month follow-up data from 386 mostly Dutch parents, mainly mothers (92%; M-age = 38.1, SD = 4.8) with children (M-age = 6.31, SD = 1.33; 54.2% boys). The children had above-average disruptive behavior (i.e., >= 75th percentile Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory questionnaire; Eyberg & Pincus, 1999). The families participated in a randomized controlled trial of the Incredible Years (IY) parenting program. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that child temperament did not moderate IY intervention effects on CDB. Furthermore, parallel process analyses showed that the IY intervention led to direct, simultaneous decreases in both negative emotionality and CDB. These findings counter the widely held belief that temperament traits are static, unchangeable modulators of the links between parenting and CDB. Instead, child temperament (negative emotionality) can at least partly be influenced by parents' participation in a parenting program.

J	Mari, MA; Clément, F; Paulus, M				Mari, Magali A.; Clement, Fabrice; Paulus, Markus			Developmental Changes in Category-Based Inductions: The Effects of Labels and Statistical Evidence on Children's Inferences About Novel Social Categories	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The psychological mechanisms that subserve inductions about novel social categories in childhood are hotly debated. While research demonstrated that language, and in particular generic statements, plays a major role in how children learn to attribute properties to social categories, developmental theories propose other mechanisms. One theoretical account holds that the mere act of labeling social categories is sufficient for children to generalize properties to category members, because labels are considered as referring to significant, homogeneous kinds of people. A second theoretical account proposes that children generalize properties to category members from statistical evidence, that is, by directly observing regularities in their environment. The present study assessed those two hypotheses, by testing (via an online experiment) the effects of simple category labels and observation of statistical evidence on European 4- to 6-year-olds (N = 88) and 7- to 9-year-olds' (N = 92) predictions about novel social categories. From around 7 to 9 years, children generalized properties to category members based on simple category labels or on their observation of a majority of unlabeled category members having the same property. Four- to 6-year-old children, however, made similarity inferences only when both labels and statistical evidence were combined. Overall, the present study highlights a developmental shift from an early limited tendency to make similarity inferences to a later propensity to infer similarity from small evidence. These findings deepen our understanding of the conditions under which children start to make similarity inferences. Implications for the acquisition of stereotypes are also discussed.

Preschoolers' Ability to Distinguish Between Possible, Impossible, and Probabilistically Distinct Future Outcomes	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Previous research has suggested that infants are able to distinguish between possible and impossible events and make basic probabilistic inferences. However, much of this research has focused on children's intuitions about past events for which the outcome is already determined but unknown. Here, we investigated children's ability to use probabilistic information to guide their choices and actively shape future events. In two experiments, we examined whether children could successfully direct a marble through a series of tubes, selecting between routes where success was possible, impossible, or guaranteed (i.e., 50% vs. 0%, or 50% vs. 100%; Experiment 1), and routes where success was mutually possible but probabilistically distinct (e.g., 33% vs. 50%; Experiment 2). In total, we tested 136 two- to five-year-old children (76 males), recruited predominantly through a museum in Brisbane, Australia. In Experiment 1, we found that while younger children typically did not perform above chance, the vast majority of 4- and 5-year-olds consistently distinguished between possible and impossible or guaranteed outcomes. In Experiment 2, children of all ages had greater difficulty with distinguishing between two possible outcomes with different likelihoods than between possible and impossible/guaranteed outcomes, although some individual 4- and 5-year-olds demonstrated competence when making both distinctions.

With age, participants increasingly endorsed statements reflecting structural attributions for racial inequality (i.e., educational and occupational exclusion), and increasingly reasoned about privilege and racism. In contrast, participants did not endorse statements reflecting individual attributions at any age (i.e., group differences in intelligence and effort), instead reasoning about equality between racial groups. Overall, participants sought expertise (i.e., content knowledge) and interpersonal trust (i.e., closeness and support) in a scenario where they could choose a discussion partner to learn more about racial inequality, and were most likely to seek out their family members, though some also sought out their friends, teachers, and the internet or social media. This study provides insights into who children see as relevant sources for learning about racial inequality and their reasons for trusting them.

The current study aimed to understand how patterns of changes in mother-adolescent perceived parenting (i.e., mother-adolescent perceived parenting transition profiles) corresponded with trajectories of mothers' and adolescents' internalizing symptoms from early to late adolescence. The current study utilized a three-wave longitudinal data set of 604 adolescents (54% female, M-age = 12.92, SD = 0.92) and 595 mothers (M-age = 38.89, SD = 5.74) from Mexican-origin immigrant families and adopted mother-adolescent perceived parenting transition profiles from a previous study. Multiple group analyses showed that mother-adolescent dyads who agreed on high levels of positive parenting across the course of adolescence (i.e., Stable Both High) experienced the lowest levels of internalizing symptoms, whereas dyads that showed an inconsistent pattern of mixed profile typologies over time (i.e., Fluctuated) experienced high levels of internalizing symptoms. For mother-adolescent dyads that consistently showed a pattern in which mothers reported more positive parenting compared to their adolescent children (i.e., Stable Mother High), mothers experienced low levels of (and even a decrease in) internalizing symptoms, while adolescents experienced considerably high levels of internalizing symptoms over time. The results for the other two parenting transition profiles (i.e., Change to Both High and Change from Both High) are also discussed. The findings highlight the importance of developing separate adaptive interventions to reduce internalizing symptoms for mothers and children by considering their change patterns of perceived parenting during the course of adolescence.

Latent growth curve analyses showed significant growth in ERI exploration, resolution, and affirmation over 3.5 years. ERS, autonomy granting, and their interaction were associated with ERI trajectories. Results also indicated significant differences between early and middle adolescents in the association between ERS, autonomy granting, and ERI exploration trajectories. Findings demonstrate the importance of concurrently examining contextual and developmental predictors of ERI formation. In addition, ERS may be particularly important for ERI development among early adolescents, whereas autonomy processes and development may play a more prominent role during middle adolescence.

Parent and Self-Socialization of Gender Intergroup Attitudes, Perceptions, and Behaviors Among Ethnically and Geographically Diverse Young Children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Previous work has shown the robust nature of gender bias in both children and adults. However, much less attention has been paid toward understanding what factors shape these biases. The current preregistered study used parent surveys and child interviews to test whether parents' conversations with their children about and modeling of gender intergroup relations and/or children's self-guided interests about gender (self-socialization) contribute to the formation of gender attitudes, status perceptions, and gender intergroup behaviors among young 4- to 6-year-old children. Our participant sample also allowed us to explore variation by child gender, ethnicity (Asian-, Black-, Latine-, and White-American), and U.S. geographical region (Northeast, Pacific Northwest, West, Southeast, and Hawaii). Data suggest that children whose parents reported they were especially active in seeking information about gender tended to allocate more resources to same-gender versus other-gender children and expressed less positive evaluations of other-gender children in comparison to children who were less active. By contrast, we found that parents' conversations with their children about gender intergroup relations and about gender-play stereotypes showed few connections with children's gender attitudes. In terms of demographic differences, boys raised in households with more unequal versus equal division of labor perceived that men had higher status than women, but few differences by ethnicity or geographic region emerged. In sum, our study suggests that both self- and parent socialization processes are at play in shaping early gender attitudes, status perceptions, and gender intergroup behavior, although self-socialization seemed to play a larger role.

Purposeful and Purposeless Aging: Structural Issues for Sense of Purpose and Their Implications for Predicting Life Outcomes	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Despite the value of sense of purpose during older adulthood, this construct often declines with age. With some older adults reconsidering the relevance of purpose later in life, the measurement of purpose may suffer from variance issues with age. The current study investigated whether sense of purpose functions similarly across ages and evaluated if the predictive power of purpose on mental, physical, cognitive, and financial outcomes changes when accounting for a less age-affected measurement structure. Utilizing data from two nationwide panel studies (Health and Retirement Study: n = 14,481; Midlife in the United States: n = 4,030), the current study conducted local structural equation modeling and found two factors for the positively and negatively valenced purpose items in the Purpose in Life subscale (Ryff, 1989), deemed the purposeful and purposeless factor. These factors become less associated with each other at higher ages. When reproducing past findings with this two-factor structure, the current study found that the purposeful and purposeless factors predicted these outcomes in the same direction as would be suggested by past research, but the magnitude of these effects differed for some outcomes. The discussion focuses on the implications of what this means for our understanding of sense of purpose across the lifespan.

This study investigated the extent to which mental health predicted educational attainment at ages 17, 20, and 25 and whether gender moderated the links between mental health and educational attainment. It used data from Next Steps, a nationally representative panel survey of individuals born in 1989/1990 in England (N = 15,594, 48% female, 33% ethnic minority). The findings suggest that differences in mental health were more consequential for educational attainment during adolescence than in young adulthood. On average, girls attained higher levels of education than boys, but gender did not moderate the role that mental health played for educational attainment.

Three Decades of Infant Motor Development: Cohort Effects in Motor Skill Onsets	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Infant motor development is affected by the sociocultural context in which it takes place. Because societal and cultural practices are dynamic, this exploratory study examined whether the ages at which infants typically learned to crawl, cruise, and walk changed over the past 3 decades. We compiled archival data from 1,306 infants born between January 31, 1992, and December 10, 2021. Parents originally reported milestone onsets in interviews and by using diaries. For each motor milestone, a linear regression model predicted the onset age using birth date. Segmented regression analyses inspected changes in slopes over time. Covariates included rural/urban housing, gestation age, season of birth, and birth weight. Infants' average crawling, cruising, and walking onset ages changed over time. After controlling for the covariates, infants' crawling onset age steadily increased until 2012, after which crawling onset age decreased. Infants' cruising onset age increased from 1991 to 2001, after which cruising onset age remained stable. After controlling for the covariates, infants' walking onset increased until 2015, after which walking onset age decreased. Thus, when infants were born explained a small but significant amount of variability in infant motor skill onset. While the current study showed that motor development changed over the years, motor development is just a model system for development more generally: Cohort effects may be pervasive across developmental domains. Using motor development as a model system for studying change suggests that generational effects due to a changing society may be pervasive across developmental domains.

Lee			Pregnant Women's Autonomic Responses to an Infant Cry Predict Young Infants' Behavioral Avoidance During the Still-Face Paradigm	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Research suggests that women's autonomic nervous system responses to infant cries capture processes that affect their parenting behaviors. The aim of this study was to build on prior work by testing whether pregnant women's autonomic responses to an unfamiliar infant crying also predict their infants' emerging regulation abilities. Participants included 97 women in their third trimester of pregnancy, located in the United States. Most participants identified as White/non-Hispanic (48%) or Hispanic (30%), their mean age was approximately 30 years, and the modal family income was $40,000-$79,999. Pregnant women's respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and skin conductance levels (SCL)-which are thought to capture emotional engagement and behavioral inhibition, respectively-were measured while the women watched a relaxing video and a video of an unfamiliar infant crying. Approximately 7 months later, women and their infants completed the still-face paradigm (SFP). Infants' avoidance and resistance behaviors during the SFP reunions were rated. Pregnant women's RSA and SCL responses to the infant cry video uniquely predicted infants' avoidance (but not resistance) during the SFP. Infants displayed higher levels of avoidance when their mothers exhibited lower levels of RSA reactivity or when their mothers exhibited higher levels of SCL activity in response to the infant cry video. Maternal sensitivity during mother-infant free-play interactions did not mediate the associations between pregnant women's autonomic responses to the cry video and infants' avoidant behavior during the SFP. Discussion focuses on potential mechanisms underlying associations between pregnant women's autonomic responses to infant distress and infants' socioemotional development.

Associations Among Temperament Characteristics and Telomere Length and Attrition Rate in Early Childhood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												There is growing interest in telomere length as an indicator of current and future health. Although early childhood is a period of rapid telomere attrition, little is known about the factors that influence telomere biology during this time. Adult research suggests that telomere length is influenced by psychological characteristics. This study's goal was to test associations among repeated measures of temperament and telomere length in a community sample of children (N = 602; 52% male, 73% non-Hispanic White, middle-to-high socioeconomic status) from infancy to age 3 years. Relative telomere length was assessed from DNA in saliva samples collected at infancy (M = 8.4 months), 2 years (M = 24.9 months), and 3 years (M = 37.8 months). Temperament was assessed via maternal report questionnaires administered at infancy (Infant Behavior Report Questionnaire-Revised) and ages 2 and 3 years (Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire). Temperament was operationalized in two ways: using the established domains of negative affectivity, surgency/extraversion, and regulation/effortful control and using person-centered scores that identified three groups of children with similar profiles across domains (emotionally and behaviorally regulated; emotionally and behaviorally dysregulated; introverted and overcontrolled). Analyses revealed that greater regulation/effortful control was associated with longer telomere length across time points. Additionally, higher surgency/extraversion, beginning in infancy, was associated with decreased rate of telomere attrition. There were no sex differences in the relations between temperament and telomere measures. These findings suggest that, as early as infancy, temperament may influence telomere biology, with a potential protective effect of positive temperament characteristics on telomere erosion.					nelson, charles/LBH-6397-2024	Nelson, Charles/0000-0002-4723-247X; Bosquet Enlow, Michelle/0000-0003-2598-3894													0012-1649	1939-0599				2023 SEP 28	2023										10.1037/dev0001635	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001635		SEP 2023						37768599					WOS:001108404000001

Children's Inferences of Moral Character Across Different Moral Subdomains	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Adults use an individual's behavior in one moral subdomain to make inferences about how they will act in another moral subdomain, reflecting a tendency to attribute underlying traits to individuals. We recruited 4- to 7-year-old children from a large city in North America to investigate their ability to generalize from one moral subdomain to another and integrate these pieces of information to form trust and friendship decisions, focusing on the subdomains of helping and fairness, given their centrality to moral cognition. In Experiment 1 (N = 131; 49% female; 38% White), children watched a protagonist help or hinder another person with their goal and then engage in either a fair or an unfair resource distribution between two novel recipients; in Experiment 2 (N = 130; 52% female; 55% White), these events were reversed. We recorded the children's surprise at the second event and their willingness to trust subsequent information provided by the protagonist and to befriend her. Children selectively generalized from the initial behavior, reporting greater surprise to fair (vs. unfair) behavior after the protagonist hindered and greater surprise to the protagonist helping (vs. hindering) after she distributed resources unfairly previously. Moreover, the presence of a single moral transgression lowered children's trust and friendship judgments to chance levels. These findings demonstrate that moral transgressions (vs. moral adherence to moral norms) provide a basis for guiding children's subsequent expectations for future behavior across moral subdomains, as well as for forming social decisions regarding whether to befriend and trust individuals, for children as young as age 4 years.

The study also examined whether membership in the developmental profiles could be predicted using a comprehensive set of kindergarten-age factors, including information on cognitive skills; motivational, parental, and home environment factors; and gender. Four profiles of arithmetic fluency skills development were identified using a factor mixture model: persistent arithmetic difficulties (12.23%), precocious onset (50.24%), delayed onset (36.96%), and precocious onset with a Grade 7 drop (.06%). The Cholesky models predicting membership in the three largest profiles suggested that overall, the strongest kindergarten-age predictors were cognitive skills (especially counting, number concepts, spatial relations, rapid automatized naming [RAN], phonological awareness, and letter knowledge), but motivational, parental, and home environment factors were also significant. Membership in the profile with precocious onset was predicted by most of the kindergarten-age measures, suggesting that the strengths in early skills, as well as motivational, parental, and home environment factors, are reflected in the advanced start in arithmetic development at school. The profiles with delayed onset and persistent difficulties were similar in most kindergarten-age measures but differed in task avoidance and four cognitive skills (letter knowledge, counting, number concepts, and RAN), suggesting that these factors predict differential development over the longer term.

Relative Brain Age Is Associated With Socioeconomic Status and Anxiety/Depression Problems in Youth	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Brain age, a measure of biological aging in the brain, has been linked to psychiatric illness, principally in adult populations. Components of socioeconomic status (SES) associate with differences in brain structure and psychiatric risk across the lifespan. This study aimed to investigate the influence of SES on brain aging in childhood and adolescence, a period of rapid neurodevelopment and peak onset for many psychiatric disorders. We reanalyzed data from the Healthy Brain Network to examine the influence of SES components (occupational prestige, public assistance enrollment, parent education, and household income-to-needs ratio [INR]) on relative brain age (RBA). Analyses included 470 youth (5-17 years; 61.3% men), self-identifying as White (55%), African American (15%), Hispanic (9%), or multiracial (17.2%). Household income was 3.95 +/- 2.33 (mean +/- SD) times the federal poverty threshold. RBA quantified differences between chronological age and brain age using covariation patterns of morphological features and total volumes. We also examined associations between RBA and psychiatric symptoms (Child Behavior Checklist [CBCL]). Models covaried for sex, scan location, and parent psychiatric diagnoses. In a linear regression, lower RBA is associated with lower parent occupational prestige (p = .01), lower public assistance enrollment (p = .03), and more parent psychiatric diagnoses (p = .01), but not parent education or INR. Lower parent occupational prestige (p = .02) and lower RBA (p = .04) are associated with higher CBCL anxious/depressed scores. Our findings underscore the importance of including SES components in developmental brain research. Delayed brain aging may represent a potential biological pathway from SES to psychiatric risk.

Children's Implicit Gender-Toy Association Development Varies Across Cultures	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Gender-stereotyped beliefs develop early in childhood and are thought to increase with age based on prior research that was primarily carried out in Western cultures. Little research, however, has examined cross-cultural (in)consistencies in the developmental trajectory of gender-stereotyped beliefs. The present study examined implicit gender-toy stereotypes among 4- to 9-year-olds (N = 1,013; 49.70% girls) in Canada, China, and Thailand. Children from all three cultures evidenced implicit gender-toy stereotypes over this developmental period, but cultural differences in the developmental pattern and strength of these stereotypes were apparent. Gender-toy stereotypes were relatively strong and stable across age groups among Thai children and relatively weak and stable across age groups among Chinese children. Canadian 4- to 5-year-old children displayed weaker stereotypes, whereas 6- to 9-year-olds displayed stronger stereotypes. These findings highlight the contribution of culture to children's gender stereotype development. Although gender-toy stereotypes were found among 4- to 9-year-olds in all three cultures examined here, the strength of these stereotypes varies by culture. Furthermore, the previously described increase in gender stereotyping over this developmental period appears to not apply across cultures, thus challenging the conventional view on development in this domain based on prior, mainly Western, research.					qian, miao/AAB-4654-2019; Wong, Ivy/AAH-1856-2019	Qian, Miao/0000-0002-6838-1407													0012-1649	1939-0599				2023 SEP 25	2023										10.1037/dev0001590	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001590		SEP 2023						37747511					WOS:001169932900001

In this prospective study, the unique contributions of parents, teachers, and peers to changes in EU from 4 to 8 years of age were therefore investigated in a birth cohort sample of 924 Norwegian children (50.1% boys). A warm parent-child relationship at 4 years of age predicted increased EU at 6 years of age but not from 6 to 8 years of age. A close teacher-child relationship forecasted enhanced EU at both 6 and 8 years of age. The results are in accordance with previous research on parents' roles and bring new knowledge by underscoring the importance of teachers in children's development of EU.

This study provides developmental insight into children's moral pride across cultures, and the potential for moral pride to underlie prosocial behavior. Participants included children and adolescents ages 6, 9, and 12 years from Canada (n = 186; 50% girls; ethnically diverse sample), Japan (n = 180; 48% girls), and a subsample from Italy (n = 86; 54% girls), as well as their primary caregivers or teachers. Moral pride was measured using a vignette procedure wherein children reported their emotions, emotion intensities, and reasoning following moral actions (harm omission and prosocial contexts). Global prosocial behavior was assessed via caregiver reports. Results revealed that moral pride increased from 6 to 9 years of age in Japanese and Canadian children (some similar trends were found in the Italian subsample) and that Canadian children reported stronger feelings of moral pride than Japanese children (Italian children's moral pride intensities were akin to those of Canadian children). Moral pride was positively associated with global prosocial behavior in Japanese children (and marginally in Italian children) but not in the Canadian children. These novel findings showcase the role of culture in shaping children's moral pride, and the potential for this moral emotion to reinforce children's commitment to prosocial action in childhood and early adolescence.

Internally and externally motivated moral identity was assessed on varying levels of abstractness for promotion orientation as well as prevention orientation in Canadian participants from three different age groups: early adolescence (13-14 years, n = 248, 119 female), late adolescence to early adulthood (17-20 years, n = 251, 160 female), and mid to old age (50-76 years, n = 129, 76 female). Findings demonstrate that the self-importance of abstract moral identity characteristics increased with age relative to concrete identity characteristics, while the relationship between the two characteristics weakened. The same trend was found for internal moral identity motivation in comparison to external motivation. The study demonstrates that moral identity does not only reflect stable individual differences but is also an important developmental construct. Merging developmental and individual difference perspectives on moral identity opens new and promising avenues for future research.

Flexibility in Children's Preference for Similar Others	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Children have a robust social preference for people similar to them, like those who share their language, accent, and race. In the present research, we show that this preference can diminish when children consider who they want to learn about. Across three experiments, 4- to 6-year-olds (total N = 160; 74 female, 86 male, from the Waterloo region in Canada, a predominantly White and middle-class region) and adults (N = 103) saw pairs of characters. One character was from nearby and had characteristics typical of the participating child's location (e.g., playing soccer), whereas the other character was from far away and had characteristics atypical of children's location (e.g., playing hurling). In Experiment 1, children had no preference when judging who they liked better, but preferred foreign characters when judging who they wanted to learn about. Experiments 2 and 3 followed up by using procedures where participants were not told anything about the characters besides whether they were local or foreign. Children and adults preferred local characters when choosing who they liked, but preferred local characters less when choosing who to learn about. These findings show that children's preferences for similar others are flexible and depend on the judgment they are making.					; Friedman, Ori/K-5429-2012	Sehl, Claudia/0000-0003-4283-1139; Friedman, Ori/0000-0003-2346-9787													0012-1649	1939-0599				DEC	2023	59	12					2333	2341		10.1037/dev0001619	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001619		SEP 2023						37732997					WOS:001108579800001

Association Between Maternal Sensitivity and Child Receptive Language Development: Quasi-Causal Evidence Using a Sibling Comparison Design	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Observational studies have shown that caregiver sensitivity predicts child language skills. These studies, however, have entirely relied on between-family designs (single parent-child dyad per family), which cannot rule out the contribution of shared family confounds (e.g., genetics, books in home). The current study investigates whether observed caregiver sensitivity predicts changes in child receptive language using a sibling comparison design. Participants were 890 Canadian children (51.7% male; 52.4% White) nested within 447 families from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds with children between the ages of 2 and 3.5 years (Wave 1) and 3.5 and 5 years (Wave 2). Independent observers provided ratings of maternal sensitivity with each sibling using several coding protocols (i.e., Coding of Attachment-Related Parenting and the Parent-Child Interaction System). Child receptive language was assessed using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. Maternal sensitivity predicted within-person change in receptive language. That is, the sibling that receives comparatively more sensitivity from the caregiver showed more development in language over time when compared to their sibling. The obverse association, child language to later maternal sensitivity, was not observed, pointing to a unidirectional association of maternal sensitivity on child receptive language. Our sibling comparison design rules out the role of shared family confounders, which provides a strong test of causal processes within an observational design.

Using 2-week, daily data from 137 ethnic/racial minority adolescents (M-age = 14.56; 53% female; 56% Black, 19% Latinx, 7% Asian, 7% Native, 12% other [e.g., multiracial]) in the Midwest United States, this study examined same-day, within-person associations between EF and school engagement (controlling for prior-day engagement), and how these associations varied by adolescents' daily experiences of ethnic/racial discrimination. Two EF components, inhibitory control and working memory, were associated with higher levels of school engagement on the same day, only on days when adolescents reported lower than their typical levels of discrimination. An alternative, indirect effect (i.e., discrimination compromised same-day school engagement via EF) was not observed. Findings highlight novel mechanisms through which discrimination may contribute to educational disparities.

Longitudinal Pathways Linking Racial Discrimination and Chinese American Mothers' Parenting	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY					Biennial Meeting of the Society-for-Research-in-Child-Development	APR 07-09, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK	Soc Res Child Developmnt				Racial discrimination is a salient and chronic stressor for ethnic minority parents that can negatively impact their parenting. The present study used a short-term longitudinal design to examine the link between Chinese American mothers' stressful experiences of racial discrimination and their authoritarian parenting practices, the mediating role of mothers' depressive symptoms, and the moderating role of their behavioral acculturation toward American and Chinese cultures in these associations (i.e., behavioral participation in the American culture and behavioral maintenance of Chinese culture). Participants were 143 first-generation Chinese American mothers (M-age = 38.0 years) with preschool-age children (M-age = 4.6 years; 50% girls). Mothers reported their racial discrimination stress, depressive symptoms, American and Chinese behavioral acculturation, and authoritarian parenting across two time points over a 6-month interval. A moderated mediation model was conducted using structural equation modeling to test the hypothesized associations. Chinese American mothers' depressive symptoms mediated the association between racial discrimination stress and authoritarian parenting. The path between racial discrimination stress and depressive symptoms and the indirect effect of racial discrimination stress on authoritarian parenting were buffered by mothers' behavioral acculturation toward American culture and exacerbated by their behavioral acculturation toward Chinese culture. This study provides the first longitudinal evidence linking Chinese American mothers' experiences of racial discrimination and their negative parenting over time as well as mediating and moderating factors underlying this process. Our findings highlight the need for systemic efforts addressing racial inequalities and fostering positive development in Asian Americans and other marginalized families.

The first aim of our study was, therefore, to distinguish parenting profiles at three time points during infancy and toddlerhood (i.e., 5, 10, and 36 months) based on mothers' supportive presence, structure and limit-setting, and quality of instruction, as well as to examine the stability of profile structure and profile membership across time. The second aim was to examine how profile membership and profile transitions at each time point are associated with relevant parental, contextual, and child-specific factors. Data from 244 Dutch mother-child dyads were collected at three waves: when children were approximately 5 months (n = 203), 10 months (n = 181), and 3 years of age (n = 178). We found three types of parenting profiles at each wave: a competent profile, a sufficient profile, and a maladaptive profile. Only the competent parenting profile was found to have a stable structure across all three waves. In general, profile membership was least stable for the maladaptive profile. Results also showed that maternal agreeableness and a higher educational level increased the likelihood to exhibit a more competent parenting profile. Our findings advance our understanding of how parenting profiles might change due to children's swiftly changing needs and inform efforts to tailor parenting interventions to individual parents. Public Significance Statement This study advances our understanding of which subgroups of parents exist during infancy and toddlerhood based on their parenting behaviors and how these subgroups change across time. Our findings inform efforts to tailor parenting interventions to parents of infants and toddlers.

Inhibitory Control Predicts Growth in Irregular Word Reading: Evidence From a Large-Scale Longitudinal Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Irregular words cannot be read correctly by decoding letters into sounds using the most common letter-sound mapping relations. They are difficult to read and learn. Cognitive models of word reading and development as well as empirical data suggest that inhibitory control might be important for irregular word reading and its development. The current study tested this in a U.K. population-based cohort (N = 529, 52.74% male, 90.17% White) in which children were assessed longitudinally at ages 5-6, 7-8, and 10-11 years. Results showed that inhibitory control did not predict concurrent irregular word reading after controlling for the covariates of decoding and vocabulary. However, inhibitory control made a small but significant contribution to growth in irregular word reading across time points, over and above vocabulary (decoding did not predict growth). Therefore, children might need to inhibit the predisposition to overgeneralize the most common relations between letters and sounds when learning to read irregular words.

"Oh No! What Happened?" An Investigation of Parent-Child Conversations About Self-Conscious Emotions	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Parents play an important role in socializing children's emotion understanding. Previous research shows that parents emphasize different aspects of emotion contexts depending on the discrete emotion. However, there is limited research on how parents and children discuss self-conscious emotions, such as embarrassment, guilt, and shame, and what socialization practices parents employ to elicit children's talk about these emotions. In this study, children (N = 166, 78 females, 88 males) ages 2-3 years (M = 2.46, SD = 0.26) and their parents (65.5% White, 10.2% Black, 17.5% Hispanic, 2.4% Asian American, and 5.4% other) from a large city in the Western United States discussed a wordless storybook depicting different female and male characters experiencing self-conscious emotions (embarrassment, guilt, shame, awe, and pride). Parents' and children's emotion talk and parents' questions were coded from their conversations about each emotion scenario and subsequently analyzed by discrete emotion, child gender, and the depicted character's gender. Parents and children differentially focused on different aspects of each self-conscious emotion as a function of discrete emotion and picture gender, and elements of children's talk about self-conscious emotions were related to children's expressive language and age. Additionally, parents' emotion talk and questions about emotions were directly related to children's emotion talk, even after controlling for children's age, expressive language, and parental education. Taken together, these findings suggest that parent-child emotion conversations may be one context that facilitates the development of children's understanding of self-conscious emotions.

Friendship Trajectories and Health Across the Lifespan	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Friends are a vital source of social relations throughout the lifespan and across developmental stages. Our knowledge of how friendships develop over time, especially from childhood through adulthood, is limited. Furthermore, it is now recognized that this specific type of relationship influences health across the life course in unique ways. Using the Convoy Model of Social Relations as a guiding framework, this study charts the multiple and unique trajectories of friendship across adulthood and tests whether these trajectories influence health differentially by age. The sample for the study consisted of 553 adults from the longitudinal Social Relations Study. Respondents ranged in age from 13 to 77 at Wave 1 (1992), and included only those who reported a best friend in each wave, that is, Wave 2 (2005) and Wave 3 (2015). Approximately 65% of the respondents were women, and 24.5% were people of color. Latent growth curve analysis identified three trajectories of the presence of friends in one's network over time, two trajectories of positive friend quality, and three for negative quality. The most consistent findings are associated with positive friend relations over time. Gender was associated with friendship quality where women reported more positive friend relations over time, and increasing positive friend relations predicted better health 23 years later. These findings demonstrate that consistent and increasing positive friendships yield health benefits over time, whereas the presence of friends and negative quality does not have an effect. Overall, findings advance understanding of the long-term effects of social relations across the lifespan and life course.

Yet, environmental contexts, such as the home and early care and education (ECE) setting, and multiple aspects of each setting, are not typically examined concurrently. In this study, we examined associations between cognitive stimulation and emotional support in the home and ECE setting during the preschool years (36-54 months) with adolescent (age 15; n = 708; 52% female) and adult (age 26; n = 584; 54% female) outcomes using data from the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, a study conducted at 10 sites across the United States. Cognitive stimulation in the home was significantly related to increased academic achievement at age 15 and educational attainment at age 26. Home emotional support was related to decreased behavior problems and increased social skills at age 15. No significant associations were found between either emotional support or cognitive stimulation in ECE and children's later development. These findings provide further support that the child's home environment during early childhood plays a substantial role in development.

Automatic Encoding Across Social Categories in American Children and Adults	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Many caregivers wonder when to talk to children about social inequality and racism, often expressing the belief that children do not pay attention to race or inequity. Here, across 5-9-year-old American children (n = 159, M-age = 7.44; 51.6% female, 47.2% male, 1.2% nonconforming or not provided; 59.1% White, 23.3% racial-ethnic minority, 17.6% not provided) and adults (n = 182, 84.1% female, 13.7% male, 2.2% nonconforming or not provided, 54.9% White, 44.5% racial-ethnic minority, 0.60% not provided), the data show that even 5-year-olds automatically encoded (i.e., spontaneously noticed and remembered) information about race, occupational status, and gender. Although children and adults encoded gender and occupational status at similar levels, adults encoded race at significantly higher levels than children. Additionally, occupational status encoding in children was sensitive to relevant environmental input (i.e., children in less affluent communities were more likely to encode occupational status) suggesting that children become "tuned in" and motivated to notice relevant, salient aspects of their environment. Given the early emergence of gender, race, and occupational status encoding, caregivers should assume that children do notice racial, occupational, or gender inequities in their environments and feel confident in the decision to begin discussing the systemic roots of inequity with children from a young age.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				DEC	2023	59	12					2296	2303		10.1037/dev0001578	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001578		AUG 2023						37616121					WOS:001108546400001

Cybele			Impacts of the Chicago School Readiness Project on Measures of Achievement, Cognitive Functioning, and Behavioral Regulation in Late Adolescence	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The current paper reports long-term impacts of the Chicago School Readiness Project (CSRP) on measures of achievement, cognitive functioning, and behavioral regulation taken toward the end of students' high school careers. The CSRP was a self-regulation-focused early childhood intervention implemented in Head Start centers serving high-poverty neighborhoods in Chicago. The intervention was evaluated through a cluster randomized control trial, providing us with rare longitudinal evidence from an experimental study. However, the study was limited by issues with low power and baseline differences between experimental groups. Here, we report on follow-up data taken approximately 11-14 years after program completion, including measures of participants' (N = 430) academic achievement, executive functioning, emotional regulation, and behavioral problems, and we provide a range of analytic estimates to address the study's methodological concerns. Across our estimates, we found little evidence that the program had lasting impacts on indicators of late-adolescent functioning. Main effects were estimated with some imprecision, but nearly all models produced null effects across the broad array of outcomes considered. We also observed few indications that effects were moderated by posttreatment high school quality or later assignment to a light-touch mindset intervention. Implications for developmental theory and early childhood policy are discussed.

Teaching or Learning From Baby: Inducing Explicit Parenting Goals Influences Caregiver Intrusiveness	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Caregivers' goals influence their interactions with their children. In this preregistered study, we examined whether directing parents to teach their baby versus learn from their baby influenced the extent to which they engaged in intrusive (e.g., controlling, adult-centered rather than child-centered), sensitive, warm, or cognitively stimulating caregiving behaviors. Mothers and their 6-month-old infants (N = 66; 32 female infants) from the San Francisco Bay Area participated in a 10-min "free-play" interaction, coded in 2-min epochs for degree of parental intrusiveness. Prior to the final epoch, mothers were randomly assigned to receive instructions to focus on (a) teaching something to their infant or (b) learning something from their infant. A control group of mothers received no instructions. Analyses of within-person changes in intrusive behavior from before to after receiving these instructions indicated that mothers assigned to teach their infant increased in intrusiveness whereas mothers assigned to learn from their infant and mothers in the control group did not significantly change in intrusiveness. The study provides experimental evidence that caregivers' explicit goals to teach infants result, on average, in more controlling and adult-centered caregiving behavior.

Links Between Parent-Child Prosocial Talk and Spatial Language	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We investigated the extent to which parents' prosocial talk and negations relate to the quantity and diversity of parents' spatial language production. We also examined similar associations among children. Participants included 51 children of ages 4-7 years and their parents recruited from South Florida. Most of the dyads included mothers and were Hispanic and bilingual. Dyads constructed a Lego house for 10 min. Sessions were transcribed and coded for instances of parent prosocial talk (praises, reflective statements, and behavior descriptions), child general positive statements (all positive contributions to the interaction), and parent and child negations (criticisms, corrections, and disapprovals) using the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System. Transcripts were also coded for quantity and diversity of spatial language including shape terms (e.g., square), dimensional adjectives (e.g., little), orientations (e.g., turn), locations (e.g., middle), and spatial features/properties (e.g., edge). Parents' prosocial language, but not negations, were significantly associated with the quantity and diversity of parents' spatial language. Children's general positive statements were significantly associated with children's spatial language quantity. Exploratory data analyses also revealed significant associations between parent- child talk about shapes, dimensions, and spatial features and properties. Findings suggest that variability in parent-child prosocial and spatial talk during collaborative spatial play relates to aspects of their own-and each other's-spatial language production. Public Significance Statement The present study suggests that aspects of the parent-child social context are related to parents' and children's production of spatial talk (e.g., talk about shapes, dimensions, and locations), language that is relevant for entry and success in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. This offers new perspectives and possible outcomes for parenting interventions that aim to improve the parent-child relationship.

J	Boutin, S; Bégin, V; Déry, M				Boutin, Stephanie; Begin, Vincent; Dery, Michele			Impacts of Psychopathic Traits Dimensions on the Development of Indirect Aggression From Childhood to Adolescence	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Children who show elevated levels of indirect aggression (IA) from childhood to adolescence are at increased risks of experiencing detrimental outcomes. Some studies suggest that psychopathic traits could act as a predisposing vulnerability in the development of IA, but the contributions of all three dimensions of psychopathic traits in explaining developmental trajectories of IA from childhood to adolescence remain unclear. This study aimed to determine if the three dimensions of psychopathic traits during childhood (i.e., callous-unemotional, narcissism-grandiosity, and impulsivity-irresponsibility at 6-9 years old) increase the risk of following a high IA trajectory across preadolescence, and whether sex moderated these associations. Participants were 744 children (47% girls; 93% born in Quebec, Canada, and over 50% from low socioeconomic backgrounds) assessed annually over 5 years. Approximately half of them (n=370; 40.3% girls) were referred to school-based services for conduct problems (CP) at study intake. Latent class growth analyses revealed four developmental trajectories of IA, which were regressed on psychopathic traits dimensions using a three-step approach. After adjusting for demographic confounders, CP, and other dimensions of psychopathic traits, only narcissism-grandiosity traits significantly predicted memberships to a high and stable trajectory of IA use. The associations between the other dimensions of psychopathic traits and IA trajectories were not significant when considering confounders. No moderating effects by child sex were observed. These results suggest that narcissism-grandiosity traits could be of use for clinicians aiming to detect children most at risk of showing high and persistent levels of IA. Public Significance Statement Elevated levels of narcissism-grandiosity traits in children can predict a high and chronic use of indirect aggression over preadolescence. As such, an early assessment of these traits could help clinicians identify those most at risk of engaging in such behaviors and thus possibly experiencing detrimental outcomes throughout adolescence.

Participants were 945 ethnic majority students (M-ageW1 = 9.86 years, SD = 1.21; 471 girls) from 51 grade 3-6 classrooms in the Netherlands. Children reported (increasingly) more positive outgroup attitudes when their internal motivation was structurally high (between-person effects) and temporarily high (within-person effect), and less positive attitudes when their external motivation was structurally and temporarily high. The between-person effects were independent of the ethnic composition and the antiprejudice climate of the classroom. These findings may help in developing interventions aimed at reducing prejudice in late childhood.Public Significance StatementThe present study showed that children's temporal and structural motivations to respond without prejudice are relevant for their attitudes toward ethnic others. Children are and become more positive toward other-ethnic peers if they find this personally relevant and attractive, but not if they want to act nonprejudiced to avoid social disapproval. These findings are important for attempts to reduce children's prejudice.

Ethnic Pride and Cultural Values Promote Positive Youth Development in a Conceptual Replication of the Five Cs Model	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The current study examined the Five Cs model of positive youth development (PYD; Lerner et al., 2005) in U.S. Mexican-origin youth (N = 674, 50% female) and tested the extent to which ethnic pride, familismo, and respeto, as an index of cultural orientation, predicted PYD across midadolescence. PYD was modeled using a bifactor structure, which defined global PYD and the Five Cs (Caring, Character, Competence, Confidence, and Connection) using theoretically similar measures matched to the conceptual definitions of the Cs. Tests of longitudinal invariance of the bifactor model at ages 14 and 16 established scalar invariance, providing support for the structure and stability of the Five Cs and global PYD using the theoretically similar measures across time. Adolescents' cultural orientation (latent factor incorporating familismo, respeto, and ethnic pride) at age 14 was positively associated with the Five Cs within and across time. Greater cultural orientation at age 14 predicted increased global PYD across ages 14 and 16. The contribution of cultural orientation to the PYD across midadolescence did not differ by adolescent gender or nativity. These findings demonstrate the robust nature and stability of the Five Cs model of PYD and provide novel evidence that ethnic pride, familismo, and respeto promote greater PYD in Mexican-origin youth during midadolescence. Public Significance Statement This study advances the idea that conducting strength-based research through the lens of cultural context may deepen scientific understanding of positive development in adolescence, particularly for samples of minoritized youth. Moreover, it provides evidence that increasing ethnic pride and connection to cultural values may significantly improve psychological well-being for Mexican-origin adolescents.

In a within-sample design, participants aged 5-6 years in the eastern region of the United States (N = 135, M-age = 5.98, SDage = .54; 78 female, 56 male; eight Asian, 43 Black, 62 White, 13 biracial, and nine "other") listened to clips of calm, scary, and sad music. In separate sessions, participants identified the emotional content of the music or reported on the feelings elicited by the music clip, with above-chance accuracy. Emotion recognition was associated with age and higher levels of child emotional verbal expressivity. Children with higher parent-reported empathy reported greater resonance with the emotion conveyed by music, specifically for sad music. Recognition and resonance were correlated (i.e., alignment), although the relationship varied as a function of the emotion expressed, with the greatest alignment for sad music. Results provide insights into emotion recognition and resonance in the absence of direct social signals and provide evidence that children's ability to recognize and resonate with emotion differs depending on characteristics of the music and the child.

Yet, these environmental stressors are unlikely to occur in isolation. We investigated how war exposure and energetic stress impact pubertal development using data from the longitudinal Biological Pathways of Risk and Resilience in Syrian Refugee Children study. Our sample included 1,600 male and female Syrian refugee children and their caregivers who lived in temporary settlements in Lebanon. We hypothesized that (a) energetic stress suppresses pubertal development; (b) war exposure accelerates pubertal timing in boys and increases risk of menarche in girls, but only when energetic stress is low; and (c) when energetic stress is elevated, effects of war exposure on pubertal development will be attenuated. Among boys, we did not find support for Hypothesis 1, but Hypotheses 2 and 3 were supported. Exposure to morbidity/mortality threats accelerated pubertal timing; this effect was attenuated under conditions of elevated energetic stress. Among girls, we found support for Hypothesis 1, but not for Hypotheses 2 and 3. Elevated energetic stress decreased the risk of menarche in girls. Neither war exposure, nor any interactions with energetic stress, predicted risk of menarche. Sensitivity analyses revealed a significant interaction between bombing exposure and the amount of time since leaving Syria. Bombing decreased the risk of menarche, but only for girls who had left Syria four or more years prior to data collection. We discuss implications for translational efforts advocating for puberty screening in medical and mental health settings to identify trauma-exposed youth.

Bidirectional Longitudinal Relations Between Executive Function and Social Function Across Adolescence	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Executive function (EF) and social function are both critical skills that continue to develop through adolescence and are strongly predictive of many important life outcomes. Longstanding empirical and theoretical work has suggested that EF shapes social function. However, there is little empirical work on this topic in adolescence, despite both EF and social function continuing to mature into early adulthood (e.g., Bauer et al., 2017). Further, adolescence might be a phase of life where social interactions can shape EF. We tested the longitudinal relation between EF and social function across adolescence utilizing a sample of 99 individuals (8-19 years) from the greater Austin area tested annually for 3 consecutive years. Although EF showed significant improvement in that span, the social function was largely consistent over age. Cross-lagged panel models revealed a bidirectional relation, such that Year 1 EF predicted social function in Year 2, and social function at Years 1 and 2 predicted EF in Year 3. When examining different components of social function, social motivation in earlier adolescence seemed to most consistently predict future EF outcomes, relative to other social functions. Our findings advance the field's theoretical understanding of how these two critical skills might develop alongside one another over adolescent development with particular emphasis on the role of social motivation on EF maturation.

Despite being a fundamental property of arithmetic, its empirical relation with arithmetic/algebraic problem solving has seldom been investigated. The current longitudinal study aimed to address this issue. Two-hundred-and-two Chinese fifth graders (57% boys) were assessed on their RO understanding. Their arithmetic/algebraic problem solving were assessed multiple times over 2 years. Results from latent growth curve modeling showed that RO understanding predicted the growth in arithmetic/algebraic problem solving when other known predictors of arithmetic/algebraic problem solving were controlled. The findings highlight the role of RO understanding in children's mathematical development. Interventions should be developed to enhance children's RO understanding.

We used longitudinal data of 1,000 children (M-age = 7.59 years) assessed on phonological awareness, rapid naming, and morphological awareness in Grade 1 and Chinese word reading, English word reading, and arithmetic calculations in Grades 1-5. Results revealed a decelerating growth pattern for word reading in Chinese and English and a linear growth pattern for arithmetic calculations. Rapid naming and morphological awareness predicted the initial status of all academic skills. The findings suggest that although these academic skills share initial cognitive processes, they follow remarkably different developmental trajectories.					; Inoue, Tomohiro/Q-6905-2017	McBride, Catherine/0000-0002-6212-3511; Ho, Connie Suk-Han/0000-0001-5533-8621; Inoue, Tomohiro/0000-0001-8163-087X													0012-1649	1939-0599				SEP	2023	59	9					1652	1667		10.1037/dev0001575	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001575		JUL 2023						37410444					WOS:001023456400001

It Takes Two: Process Praise Linking Trying and Success Is Associated With Greater Infant Persistence	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Process praise (i.e., praise for effort) facilitates childhood persistence. However, less is known about the mechanism by which process praise influences persistence in infancy. Here, we propose that well-timed process praise reinforces the link between effort and success, thus promoting persistence in young children. In Experiment 1, U.S. infants aged 17-18 months old (N = 29; 13 females; M-age = 18 months, 3 days; 76% White) and in Experiment 2, Canadian toddlers aged 17-31 months old (N = 60; 34 females; M-age = 22 months, 17 days; 40% White) participated with caregivers. Across experiments, caregiver process and general praise overlapping temporally with both trying and success related to greater persistence during a dyadic task, while praise offered only during trying or success was not. However, the effects of temporally aligned process praise were more robust than the effects of general praise. Furthermore, process praise which did not correspond to children's actions (i.e., high-volume or randomly dispersed process praise) negatively related to persistence. Thus, these findings demonstrate that young children are responsive to temporal alignment in praise and further suggest that temporal alignment especially in process praise may help form the basis for later mindset models.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				SEP	2023	59	9					1668	1675		10.1037/dev0001584	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001584		JUL 2023						37410443					WOS:001023476000001

The present study examined whether caregivers' responsiveness would influence young children's expectations of caregivers' support-giving behavior and willingness under different situational stress levels. We manipulated the caregivers' responsiveness and situational stress levels. Children were tested to determine their expectations of caregivers' support-giving behavior and willingness. Sixty-four (33 boys, M-age = 5.34) and 68 (34 boys, M-age = 5.25) Chinese Han children from a city in Southeast China participated in Studies 1 and 2, respectively. In Study 1, we created a separation condition (i.e., a moderate level of stress) and found that children's expectations of caregivers' support-giving behavior and willingness were significantly lower in the unresponsive condition than in the responsive condition. The expectations in the unresponsive condition decreased significantly compared with the initial expectations. In Study 2, we created a danger condition (i.e., a high level of stress) and found that caregivers' responsiveness had no significant effect on children's expectations of caregivers' support-giving behavior and willingness. These results imply that both caregivers' responsiveness and situational stress levels affect children's expectations of caregivers' support-giving. They further suggest that children aged 4-6 can simultaneously assess caregivers' responsiveness and situational stress levels while forming support-giving expectations.

Sequence analysis of monthly occupational status over 4 years (ages 16-20) in a low socioeconomic status Canadian sample overrepresenting academically-vulnerable youth (N = 386; 50% male; 23% visible minority) generated five school-to-work pathways: two work-bound ones with jobs perceived as aligned with career goals (Career Job, 10%) or not (Fill-In Job, 26%), alongside three others (Disconnected [15%], Prolonged Secondary Education [25%], Postsecondary Education [24%]). Mental health was strongest in the Career Job pathway. Male sex and adolescent employment were precursors to this advantageous pathway, underscoring the crucial role of work experience.

J	Ren, JL; Wang, M; Arciuli, J				Ren, Jinglei; Wang, Min; Arciuli, Joanne			A Meta-Analysis on the Correlations Between Statistical Learning, Language, and Reading Outcomes	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The purpose of this meta-analytic review is to investigate the relation between statistical learning (SL) and language-related outcomes, and between SL and reading-related outcomes. A comprehensive search of peer-reviewed published research resulted in 42 articles with 53 independent samples and 201 reported effect sizes (Pearson's r). Results of our robust variance estimation correlated effects model revealed a significant, moderate relation between SL and language-related outcomes, r = .236, p < .001, and a significant, moderate relation between SL and reading-related outcomes, r = .239, p < .001. Moreover, age, the writing system of the language, and SL paradigm moderate the strength of the association between SL and reading. Age is the only significant moderator on the strength of the association between SL and language. The findings from this meta-analysis shed light on the contribution of multiple factors that impact how SL relates to language and reading outcomes, with important implications for developing effective instructional practices that emphasize statistical regularities of oral and written materials in the classroom. Theoretical implications of these findings for language and reading development are discussed.

K.; Lucca, Kelsey			Children and Adults Exhibit a Common Vertical Attention Bias for Object Tops and Scene Bottoms	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Adults have a vertical attention bias (VAB) that directs their focus toward object tops and scene bottoms. This is consistent with focusing attention on the informative aspects and affordances of the environment, and generally favoring a downward gaze. The smaller size of children, combined with their relatively limited interactions with objects and scenes, could lead them to have diminished bias that only gradually develops. Alternatively, an early coupling of attention to action space could lead to VAB similar to adults. The current study investigates the developmental timeline of VAB, comparing 4-7-year-olds to adults. Participants (N = 50 children, 53 adults; 58% White, 22% Asian, 6% Black, 2% Native American, and 12% other) observed naturalistic photographic triptychs (48 objects, 52 scenes, all online). They made similarity judgments comparing a test figure to two flanking figures containing either the same top or same bottom. We found that (a) children and adults exhibit a common VAB for object tops and scene bottoms and (b) the adult bias is stronger than children's. Exploratory analyses revealed the same age trend within children, with VAB increasing with age, and asymptoting at the adult level at age 8. This demonstrates that despite age and body size differences that could make the environment for young children relatively disparate from adults, their perceptual system is already largely attuned to their individual interactive action space, with only minor continuing residual development. The findings support that, like adults, young children focus their attention on their action space and body level affordances, where they interact more with tops of objects and bottoms of scenes.

J	Chuey, A; Lockhart, K; Trouche, E; Keil, F				Chuey, Aaron; Lockhart, Kristi; Trouche, Emmanuel; Keil, Frank			Young Children Can Infer Information Preferences From Goals and Recommend Appropriate Sources to Others	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												As adults, we intuitively understand how others' goals influence their information-seeking preferences. For example, you might recommend a dense book full of mechanistic details to someone trying to learn about a topic in-depth, but a more lighthearted book flled with surprising stories to someone seeking entertainment. Moreover, you might do this with confdence despite knowing few details about either book. Even though we offer or receive such recommendations frequently as adults, we know little about how the ability to evaluate and recommend information sources to others develops. Two studies examined how children (6-9 years, Eastern U.S. residents, n = 311) and adults (U.S. residents, n = 180) select mechanistic and entertaining information sources for others depending on their goals. Participants recommended books containing mechanistic information to agents who wanted to learn and entertaining information to agents who wanted to have fun. In contrast to adults who strongly favored entertaining books, children recommended both kinds of books equally to a generally curious agent. These results suggest children can infer others' information-seeking preferences based on their goals and recommend appropriate information sources to satisfy those goals despite possessing little topical knowledge themselves.Public Significance Statement The current fndings demonstrate young children can reason about and recommend information sources to others despite often possessing little relevant knowledge themselves. These fndings also highlight a potential decline in interest in causal mechanisms into adulthood, which is of potential importance to educators wishing to increase interest and curiosity toward science, technology, engineering, and mathematics topics.

Children who experience exclusion based on social class are at risk of experiencing a lack of opportunities, contributing to societal disparities. Recently, developmental science has examined the origins of attitudes that contribute to social exclusion, reflecting moral judgments about fairness as well as societal and group-based concerns about norms and intergroup dynamics. This study investigated children's reasoning about intergroup exclusion by focusing on social class as a potential exclusion criterion for children and adolescents in peer contexts in Turkiye, an understudied context for research. Participants living in a metropolitan area of Turkiye (N = 270) between the ages of 8-10 (M-age = 9.80; SD = .77; 53.5% girls) and 14-16 (M-age = 15.51; SD = .93, 61.7% girls) from lower and higher socioeconomic backgrounds were asked for their exclusion evaluations, emotion attributions, related justifications, and individual solutions. While participants overall viewed social class-based social exclusion as wrong, adolescents typically viewed it as more wrong than did children. Adolescents focused on unfair treatment and discrimination, whereas children focused on interpersonal aspects of social exclusion more frequently. Older participants from lower socioeconomic status (SES) viewed the excluders' intentions as discriminatory more often than did older participants from higher SES who desired to protect the status quo. These findings shed new light on how children and adolescents evaluate societal-based biases contributing to peer social exclusion.

J	Nikstat, A; Beam, CR; Riemann, R				Nikstat, Amelie; Beam, Christopher R.; Riemann, Rainer			Gene-Environment Interplay in Internalizing Problem Behavior	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Behavior genetic methods are useful for examining mechanisms underlying the interaction between genetic and family environmental factors of internalizing problem behavior (INT). Previous twin studies, however, have shown little consistency in interaction patterns, depending on type and operationalization of measured environments. The aim of the current study was to explore different gene-by-environment interaction patterns among different family-level environmental risk factors and resources known to correlate with INT. Using an empirical-based approach, we combined various indicators of the family environment to derive four dimensions: positive parenting, negative parenting, lack of parental resources, and socioeconomic status. We then used a genetically informed design of twins raised in the same family to test whether interaction patterns followed a diathesis stress or vantage sensitivity model formulation. The sample consisted of 2,089 twin pairs and their families from two twin birth cohorts (ages 11 and 17) participating in Wave 1 of the German TwinLife study of social inequalities. In line with a vantage sensitivity pattern of interaction and with the bioecological model of development (Bronfenbrenner & Ceci, 1994), evidence for a general mechanism of gene-environment interaction with increasing nonshared environmental variance for more adverse and less propitious family conditions was found. In preadolescence, parenting behavior had a greater moderating influence on INT compared to general family conditions like socioeconomic status. Interventions for INT that directly involve parents, thus, may be more important in preadolescent populations whereas individual interventions for adolescents may be more successful if they are adapted to different levels of socioeconomic status.

By now, there are some first applications of the model to investigate reciprocal relations in self-concept development. However, a methodological-substantive integration of the model in the context of the three major comparison processes in self-concept development is still missing, and it has not been used to evaluate dimensional and temporal comparison effects. We provide such an integration in self-concept theory and applied the RI-CLPM to investigate social, dimensional, and temporal comparison effects simultaneously. Investigating a sample of 701 German students from the middle of Grade 9 to the middle of Grade 10, we confirmed previous results by finding trait-like stability in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) self-concept as well as in STEM and language achievement. We also found evidence for all three comparison effects, but evidence for dimensional comparison effects was only found at the between-person level of the RI-CLPM.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				SEP	2023	59	9					1595	1607		10.1037/dev0001568	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001568		JUN 2023						37347894					WOS:001016550900001

In the current study, we examine whether there is an indirect effect of victimization on adult depression and aggression, via sad and angry rumination about past victimization. Participants included 1,319 Finnish individuals (59.5% identified as women; 97.4 native Finns) who were followed from adolescence into adulthood (M-age = 25.78, SD = 1.35). Victimization was indirectly associated with adult depression and aggression, through sad and angry ruminations, respectively. The findings suggest that intervention efforts targeting rumination could help victimized individuals avoid lasting ill effects from their experiences.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				AUG	2023	59	8					1464	1469		10.1037/dev0001544	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001544		JUN 2023						37347895					WOS:001016474100001

This study extends the literature on the long-term associations between high-quality caregiver sensitivity and responsiveness and cognitive stimulation (i.e., caregiving quality) in ECE settings and success in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in high school. Using the 1991 National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (n = 1,096; 48.6% female; 76.4% White, 11.3% African American, 5.8% Latine, 6.5% other), results demonstrated that caregiving quality in ECE was associated with reduced disparities between low- and higher-income children's STEM achievement and school performance at age 15. Disparities in STEM school performance (i.e., enrollment in advanced STEM courses and STEM grade point average) and STEM achievement (i.e., Woodcock-Johnson cognitive battery) were reduced when children from lower-income families experienced more exposure to higher caregiving quality in ECE. Further, results suggested an indirect pathway for these associations from caregiving quality in ECE to age 15 STEM success through increased STEM achievement in Grades 3 through 5 (ages 8-11 years). Findings suggest that community-based ECE is linked to meaningful improvements in STEM achievement in Grades 3 through 5 which in turn relates to STEM achievement and school performance in high school, and caregiving quality in ECE is particularly important for children from lower-income backgrounds. This work has implications for policy and practice positioning caregivers' cognitive stimulation and sensitivity in ECE settings across the first 5 years of life as a promising lever for bolstering the STEM pipeline for children from lower-income backgrounds.

Attention and Behavior Problems in Childhood Predict Adult Financial Status, Health, and Criminal Activity: A Conceptual Replication and Extension of Moffitt et al. (2011) Using Cohorts From the United States and the United Kingdom	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study is a conceptual replication of a widely cited study by Moffitt et al. (2011) which found that attention and behavior problems in childhood (a composite of impulsive hyperactive, inattentive, and impulsive-aggressive behaviors labeled "self-control") predicted adult financial status, health, and criminal activity. Using data from longitudinal cohort studies in the United States (n = 1,168) and the United Kingdom (n = 16,506), we largely reproduced their pattern of findings that attention and behavior problems measured across the course of childhood predicted a range of adult outcomes including educational attainment (beta(U.S). = -0.22, beta(U.K). = -0.13) and spending time in jail (ORU.S. = 1.74, ORU.K. = 1.48). We found that associations with outcomes in education, work, and finances diminished in the presence of additional covariates for children's home environment and achievement but associations for other outcomes were more robust. We also found that attention and behavior problems across distinct periods of childhood were associated with adult outcomes. Specific attention and behavior problems showed some differences in predicting outcomes in the U.S. cohort, with attention problems predicting lower educational attainment and hyperactivity/impulsivity predicting ever spending time in jail. Together with the findings fromMoffitt et al., our studymakes clear that childhood attention and behavior problems are associated with a range of outcomes in adulthood for cohorts born in the 1950s, 1970s, and 1990s across three countries. Public Significance Statement This study reveals that findings from Moffitt et al. (2011) that children exhibiting attention and behavior problems had greater financial struggles, poorer health, and a greater likelihood of criminality once they reached adulthood, generalized to cohorts born in different decades in the United States and the United Kingdom. Given the consistency of findings across cohorts, attention, and behavior problems in childhood appear to make it difficult to meet the demands of one's environment throughout development.

J	Pauen, S; Peykarjou, S				Pauen, Sabina; Peykarjou, Stefanie			Infants' Fast Neural Categorization of Artificial Objects: The Impact of Stimulus and Task Characteristics	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study explores how 7-month-old infants categorize graphical images varying in basic perceptual features by using a fast periodic visual stimulation (FPVS) task. Most participants were Caucasian and their parents had a higher education, but the family's socioeconomic background was mixed. Experiment 1 (N = 23) tested brain responses to configurational versus scrambled image sequences and found an oddball effect for both conditions, with configurational information leading to stronger neural responses. Experiment 2 explored the role of category learning for later FPVS performance: Group A (control; n = 22) participated in the FPVS categorization task only. Group B (fam; n = 21) was first familiarized with standard exemplars. Group C (fam + contrast; n = 29) was presented an additional exemplar of the contrasting category before the FPVS task. Electroencephalogram analyses revealed a decrease in Nc amplitude (measuring attention) throughout the familiarization phase. Long looking at the out-of-category exemplar in Group C indicated infants' visual interest. Brain responses in the subsequently presented FPVS were strong but did not differ between groups. This highlights the ability of the infant brain to organize perceptual input very rapidly without requiring familiarization but also points to the need for further studies exploring brain processes associated with infants' category learning and categorization at the brain level.Public Significance StatementWithin milliseconds, the brain of 7-month-old infants categorized artificial objects based on low-level perceptual features, but responses were stronger when additional configurational information was provided. A familiarization with the standard category led to neural adaptation and to visual interest in a subsequently presented out-of-category exemplar, but this experience did not affect categorization in a FPVS task, thus pointing to the need of more studies exploring the mechanisms underlying infant categorization.

Latent Class Analysis of Maternal Depression From Pregnancy Through Early Childhood: Differences in Children's Executive Functions	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Prenatal and postpartum depression are highly prevalent worldwide, and emerging evidence suggests they contribute to impairments in children's executive functions. Studies of maternal depression, however, have focused on the postpartum and postnatal periods with relatively less consideration of prenatal influences on child development. This study of the large population-based Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children U.K. cohort estimates latent classes of maternal depression across the prenatal, postpartum, and postnatal periods to capture heterogeneity in the developmental timing and length of maternal depression, as well as to test whether latent classes differ in children's executive function impairments in middle childhood. Repeated measures latent class analysis yielded five groups demonstrating unique patterns of change in maternal depression from pregnancy through early childhood (n = 13,624). Latent classes differed in executive functions at age 8 among a subsample of children (n = 6,870). Children exposed to chronic maternal depression beginning in utero showed the most impairments in inhibitory control while accounting for child sex, verbal IQ, parents' highest education level, and average family income in childhood. The critical roles of the timing and length of children's exposure to maternal depression are discussed in relation to executive function development, prevention, and intervention.

Increased Integration of Functional Connectivity After Cognitive Intervention in Preschoolers From Low Socioeconomic Status	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Cognitive interventions that involve executive functions (EF)-demanding activities are effective in changing task-related brain activity in children from homes with low socioeconomic status (SES). However, less is known about the efficiency of EF-based interventions in modifying segregation and integration properties of the functional neural organization during a resting state. Further, the consideration of the initial cognitive performance in the design of interventions and its role in the outcome of cognitive training has been poorly studied. The present study aimed to examine the impact of two individualized cognitive interventions with EF-demanding activities on brain connectivity in preschoolers (n = 79) from low-SES homes in Argentina using complex network analysis. At baseline, participants were classified as high- or low-performers based on their performance in an inhibitory control task, and then they were assigned into intervention and control groups within each performance level. Before and after the intervention, the neural activity of each child was recorded at rest using a mobile electroencephalogram device. We found significant intervention-related changes in global efficiency, global strength, and the strength of long-range connections in the ? frequency band in the intervention low-performing group. These findings support the idea that patterns of processing crucial information in the brain may be modified in children from low-SES homes through an EF-based intervention. Finally, these findings show different intervention-related effects on neural activity between children with low and high initial cognitive performance and add new evidence about the interaction between individual characteristics and intervention approaches.Public Significance StatementThe present study suggests that EF-based interventions may help to promote patterns for processing crucial information in the brain among children from low-SES homes. Additionally, it highlights the importance of considering individual differences in the development of interventions, which may be an essential step toward designs aimed to meet the needs of specific individuals or at improving specific neural and cognitive processes.

Children's and Parents' Talk About Difficulty During Dyadic Interactions	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Children's beliefs about the contribution of effort and ability to success and failure shape their decisions to persist or give up on challenging tasks, with consequences for their academic success. But how do children learn about the concept of "challenge"? Prior work has shown that parents' verbal responses to success and failure shape children's motivational beliefs. In this study, we explore another type of talk-parent and child talk about difficulty-which could contribute to children's motivational beliefs. We performed secondary analyses of two observational studies of parent-child interactions in the United States (Boston and Philadelphia) from age 3 to fourth grade (Study 1, 51% girls, 65.5% White, at least 43.2% below Federal poverty line) and at first grade (Study 2, 54% girls, 72% White, family income-to-needs ratio M [SD] = 4.41 [2.95]) to identify talk about difficulty, characterize the content of those statements, and assess whether task context, child and parent gender, child age, and other parent motivational talk were associated with the quantity of child and parent difficulty talk. We found that many families did discuss difficulty, with variation among families. Parents and children tended to use general statements to talk about difficulty (e.g., "That was hard!"), and task context affected child and parent difficulty talk. In the NICHD-SECCYD dataset, mothers' highlighting how task features contributed to task difficulty was positively correlated with their process praise, suggesting that this talk could be motivationally relevant.

A Longitudinal Assessment of Adolescents' Sexual Communication With Parents, Best Friends, and Dating Partners	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Sexual health communication in adolescence is important for sexual well-being. With limited empirical work utilizing longitudinal methodologies, this study aimed to investigate how the frequency of sexual communication with parents, peers, and dating partners changes across adolescence and varies based on sex, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Participants included 886 U.S. adolescents (54.4% females; 45.9% White, 22.6% Hispanic/Latinx, 21.6% Black/African American) surveyed yearly from middle school through 12th grade. Growth curve models were used to estimate trajectories of the frequency in communication. Results showed curvilinear trajectories for adolescents' sexual communication with their parents, best friends, and dating partners over time. Although all three trajectories showed curvilinear patterns, sexual communication with parents and best friends increased earlier in adolescence and leveled off, while sexual communication with dating partners was lower in early adolescence and showed a steep increase across adolescence. Communication trajectories significantly diverged depending on adolescents' sex and race/ethnicity but not their sexual orientation. This study provides the first evidence of developmental changes over time in adolescent sexual communication with parents, best friends, and dating partners. Developmental implications for adolescents' sexual decision making are discussed.

Effects of English Versus Spanish Language Exposure on Basic Multisensory Attention Skills Across 3 to 36 Months of Age	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Recent research has demonstrated that individual differences in infant attention to faces and voices of women speaking predict language outcomes in childhood. These findings have been generated using two new audiovisual attention assessments appropriate for infants and young children, the Multisensory Attention Assessment Protocol (MAAP) and the Intersensory Processing Efficiency Protocol (IPEP). The MAAP and IPEP assess three basic attention skills (sustaining attention, shifting/disengaging, intersensory matching), as well as distractibility, deployed in the context of naturalistic audiovisual social (women speaking English) and nonsocial events (objects impacting a surface). Might children with differential exposure to Spanish versus English show different patterns of attention to social events on these protocols as a function of language familiarity? We addressed this question in several ways using children (n = 81 dual-language learners; n = 23 monolingual-language learners) from South Florida, tested longitudinally across 3-36 months. Surprisingly, results indicated no significant English language advantage on any attention measure for children from monolingual English versus dual English-Spanish language environments. Second, for dual-language learners, exposure to English changed across age, decreasing slightly from 3-12 months and then increasing considerably by 36 months. Furthermore, for dual-language learners, structural equation modeling analyses revealed no English language advantage on the MAAP or IPEP as a function of degree of English language exposure.

The Early Steps Multisite study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT00538252) is a randomized controlled trial of the FCU and consists of a large, racially and ethnically diverse sample of children who grew up in low-income households in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Eugene, Oregon; and Charlottesville, Virginia (n = 731; 49% female; 27.6% African American, 46.7% European American, 13.3% Hispanic/Latinx). To represent a comorbid presentation of internalizing and externalizing problems, we fit a bifactor model that included a general psychopathology (p) factor at eight ages in early childhood (ages 2-4), middle childhood (ages 7.5-10.5), and adolescence (age 14). Latent growth curve modeling was conducted to examine trajectories of the p factor across ages within the developmental periods of early and middle childhood. The effects of FCU on the reductions in growth in the childhood p factor had cascading effects on adolescent p factor (i.e., within-domain effect) and polydrug use (i.e., across-domain effect). Findings underscore the utility of the early FCU in preventing a host of maladaptive adolescent outcomes across diverse settings and populations.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				AUG	2023	59	8					1484	1495		10.1037/dev0001543	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001543		MAY 2023						37199932					WOS:000992282900001

Existing evidence suggests that children start to grasp that causes must precede their effects (the temporal priority principle) by age 3; however, whether younger children also understand this has, to our knowledge, not previously been tested. Given the importance of temporal priority in making sense of the world, we explored when knowledge of this principle develops. In the present study, conducted in a lab or museum in a Canadian city, 1- and 2-year-old children observed an adult perform action A on a puzzle box (e.g., spinning a dial), following which an effect E occurred (a sticker was dispensed), following which the adult performed action B (e.g., pushing a button; A-E-B sequence). In line with the temporal priority principle, toddlers were significantly more likely to manipulate A than B (Experiment 1, N = 41, 22 female), even when A was spatially disconnected from the sticker dispenser and further from it than action B (Experiment 2, N = 42, 25 female). In Experiment 3 (N = 50, 25 female), toddlers observed an A-B-E sequence such that both actions A and B were performed prior to effect E. Here, they primarily intervened on B, which ruled out that success in Experiments 1-2 was based on a primacy effect. A lack of any age effects across experiments suggests that within the second year of life, children already grasp that causes must precede their effects, providing key insights into causal reasoning in early childhood.

Participants were assigned, with age stratification, to the immediate intervention (n = 23) or waiting-list group (n = 21). The assessments were conducted by blind evaluators before the intervention, immediately after, and 6 months later. Resulting specifically from the intervention, parents sustainably improved their reminiscing style (e.g., greater provision of feedback and use of metamemory comments). The effects of the intervention on children's outcomes were, however, less clear. Based on the social-constructivist approach, such effects could be expected to occur later.

Critically, the processes and contexts that support the development of value-based remembering are largely unknown. The present study examined the effects of feedback and metacognitive differences on value-based remembering in predominantly White adults from a Western university (N = 89) and children aged 9-14 years old recruited nationwide (N = 87). Participants completed an associative recognition task during which they memorized items worth varying point values under one of three feedback conditions (point feedback, memory-accuracy feedback, or no feedback). Developmental differences emerged such that children were most likely to selectively remember high-value items when receiving memory-accuracy feedback while adults were most selective when receiving point-based feedback. Furthermore, adults had more accurate metacognitive insight into how value impacted performance. These findings suggest developmental differences in the effects of feedback in value-based remembering and the role of metacognition.

In the present research, child participants completed a novel measure designed to test their reactions to another child's racially discriminatory behavior. The measure presented scenarios in which a protagonist who matched the participant's race (Asian, Latinx, or White) repeatedly excluded Black children from different social activities. Participants evaluated the protagonist's behavior and had an opportunity to confront the protagonist. Both a pilot study and a full preregistered study revealed that the novel measure had high reliability within participants and substantial variability across participants (pilot study: N = 54 U.S. White 5-7-year-olds, 27 girls, 27 boys, median household income range of $125,001-$150,000; full study: N = 126 U.S. 4-10-year-olds, 33.33% Asian, 33.33% Latinx, 33.33% White, 56 girls, 70 boys, median household income: $120,001-$125,000). In the full study, older children and children whose parents reported more racial socialization rated the protagonist's behavior more negatively; older children were also more likely to confront the protagonist. Neither participants' own race nor their prior exposure to racial diversity impacted their evaluations or confrontations of discrimination. The results have implications for understanding children's potential to serve as agents of social change by regulating other children's racial biases and behaviors.

J	Schmuckler, MA; Paolozza, A				Schmuckler, Mark A.; Paolozza, Angelina			Auditory Influences on Walking: Children's Walking to the Beat	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Research on the multisensory control of locomotion has demonstrated that adults exhibit auditory-motor entrainment across an array of contexts. In such work adults will consciously modulate the cadence of their walking when instructed to match their footfalls to an auditory metronome equal to, slower than, or faster than, their natural walking cadence. The current study extends such investigations to young toddlers between 14 and 24 months (n = 59, drawn from Toronto, Ontario), as well as adults (n = 20, drawn from Toronto, Ontario), demonstrating that even new walkers will modify their gait when presented with auditory input at or faster than their natural walking cadence. Additionally, the current study demonstrates that such modulations will occur in the absence of explicit instructions to modify gait for both toddlers and adults, suggesting an automatic level of auditory-motor entraining across ages.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				JUL	2023	59	7					1236	1248		10.1037/dev0001552	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001552		MAY 2023						37199924					WOS:000990906300001

Effects of Manipulating Play Materials on Parental Math Talk	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Given the established role of parental talk in the growth of math knowledge in preschoolers, there has been an increasing focus on identifying ways to promote parental math talk at this stage of child development. The current study investigated how parental math talk is affected by features of play materials and contexts. The features were manipulated along two dimensions: homogeneity (whether the toys were unique or included identical sets) and boundedness (whether the number of toys was restricted). Parent-child dyads (n = 75, child's age: 4-6) from China were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions: unique objects-unbounded range, homogeneous sets-unbounded range, and homogeneous sets-bounded range. In all conditions, dyads played games in two contexts that varied in the extent to which they were typically associated with math-party preparation and grocery shopping. As expected, more parental math talk was observed in the grocery shopping than in the party preparation context. Importantly, the manipulation of features within context also affected the amount and nature of parental math talk: homogeneity increased absolute magnitude talk, and boundedness increased relative magnitude talk. The results provide support for the cognitive alignment framework, underscoring the importance of aligning the features of materials with targeted concepts and demonstrating the possibility of impacting parental math talk through small manipulations of play materials.Public Significance Statement The study suggests that small changes in the features of play materials, such as including sets of identical toys, may increase the quantity and quality of parental math talk in play interactions with preschoolers. It also shows that parental math talk is affected by the context of pretend play. These findings point to opportunities for increasing parental math talk without intensive training or explicit instructions.

This study investigated how within-person fluctuations in daily domains of stress (i.e., family, peer, and academic) and between-person differences in average stress levels were associated with four Chinese adolescent adjustment indicators (i.e., positive and negative emotions, sleep quality, and subjective vitality). Participants included 315 Chinese adolescents (48.3% girls; M-age = 13.05 years, SD = 0.77 years) who completed a 10-day diary on each domain of stress and indicators of adjustment. Multilevel models revealed that peer stress had the most detrimental association with Chinese adolescents' adjustment at both within-person (i.e., higher same-day and next-day negative emotions) and between-person (i.e., higher negative emotions, worse sleep quality, and lower subjective vitality) levels. Academic stress was only significant at the between-person level, corresponding to worse sleep quality and increased levels of negative emotions. Family stress exhibited mixed associations and was positively associated with positive and negative emotions and subjective vitality. These findings underscore the need to examine the impact of multiple domains of stress on Chinese adolescent adjustment. Further, identification and intervention for adolescents with elevated peer stress may be particularly helpful for increasing healthy adjustment.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				JUL	2023	59	7					1346	1358		10.1037/dev0001538	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001538		MAY 2023						37199929					WOS:000990742900001
J	Yang, F; Yang, X; Dunham, Y				Yang, Fan; Yang, Xin; Dunham, Yarrow			Beyond Our Tribe: Developing a Normative Sense of Group-Transcendent Fairness	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Human beings naturally prefer and support ingroup members more than outgroup members, but to what extent do we morally value equal treatment to ingroups and outgroups? Across four preregistered studies, we examined the development of "group-transcendent fairness," that is, the moral endorsement of allocating resources equally to ingroup members and outgroup members. We found that when allocating common resources to ingroup and outgroup members, American adults (N = 549) thought it was morally right to allocate equally instead of giving more to their family, political, or minimal ingroup members, across high and low stakes (Study 1). This normative sense of group-transcendent fairness develops gradually: 4- to 6-year-olds tended to endorse ingroup favoritism, whereas by age 8 or 9 children endorsed intergroup fairness (Studies 2-3, N = 214). Adults from China (N = 200)-a culture that values ingroup loyalty-also endorsed intergroup fairness as morally right, suggesting this moral value is not specific to western societies where egalitarianism is emphasized (Study 4). In contrast to the normative endorsement of intergroup fairness, participants in all studies did not predict most people to be fair across contexts, suggesting group-transcendent fairness was perceived more as a prescriptive than a descriptive norm (Studies 1-4). Together, our studies reveal the robust presence of group-transcendent fairness, which is valued across group contexts and cultures, develops later than ingroup support, and is prescriptive but not descriptive by nature. The findings help illuminate the nature and development of one group-transcendent moral value that helps promote intergroup relations and societal progress.

Kindergarten Predictors of Formal Understanding of Mathematical Equivalence in Second Grade	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												A longitudinal study was conducted to identify unique sources of individual differences in later understanding of the equal sign as a relational symbol of equivalence (i.e., formal understanding of mathematical equivalence). The sample included 141 children from a mid-sized city in the Midwestern United States (M-age = 6 years, 2 months in kindergarten; 88 boys, 53 girls; 71% white, 8% Hispanic or Latine, 7% Black, 3% Asian, 11% multiracial or other race/ethnicity; 42% qualified for free/reduced lunch). Children were assessed on three categories of skills in kindergarten including number knowledge, relational thinking, and executive functioning. These skills were hypothesized to provide a foundation for a formal understanding of mathematical equivalence (assessed in second grade) by preventing a specific, narrow misunderstanding of the equal sign that hinders learning. Results showed that kindergarten relational thinking, particularly tasks assessing nonsymbolic equivalence understanding, uniquely and positively predicted formal understanding of mathematical equivalence and negatively predicted the specific misunderstanding of the equal sign in second grade, controlling for IQ, gender, and free/reduced lunch status. Exploratory analyses unpacking the categories of skills into individual tasks also indicated specific areas of kindergarten instructional focus that may help children construct understanding of mathematical equivalence in future years.Public Significance Statement Understanding the equal sign as a relational symbol of equivalence is a foundational pre-algebra concept. We found that children who had higher relational thinking skills in kindergarten had a better understanding of the equal sign by second grade than their peers with lower relational thinking skills in kindergarten. Our findings identify early relational thinking as a potential topic of interest for future research on kindergarten instruction aimed at improving later pre-algebraic learning.

J	Zhuang, W; Niebaum, J; Munakata, Y				Zhuang, Winnie; Niebaum, Jesse; Munakata, Yuko			Changes in Adaptation to Time Horizons Across Development	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												When making decisions, the amount of time remaining matters. When time horizons are long, exploring unknown options can inform later decisions, but when time horizons are short, exploiting known options should be prioritized. While adults and adolescents adapt their exploration in this way, it is unclear when such adaptation emerges and how individuals behave when time horizons are ambiguous, as in many real-life situations. We examined these questions by having 5- to 6-year-olds (N = 43), 11- to 12-year-olds (N = 40), and adult college students (N = 49) in the United States complete a Simplified Horizons Task under short, long, and ambiguous time horizons. Adaptation to time horizons increased with age: older children and adults explored more when horizons were long than when short, and while some younger children adapted to time horizons, younger children overall did not show strong evidence of adapting. Under ambiguous horizons, older children and adults preferred to exploit over explore, while younger children did not show this preference. Thus, adaptation to time horizons is evident by ages 11-12 and may begin to emerge around 5-6 years, and children decrease their tendencies to explore under short and ambiguous time horizons with development. This developmental shift may lead to less learning but more adaptive decision making.

Effect of Carrying Objects on Walking Characteristics and Language Abilities in 13-and 24-Month-Olds	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Learning to walk leads to an increase in language abilities; however, the underlying mechanisms accounting for this relation remain unclear. Investigating the quality of early gait control may offer some insights. The purpose of this study was to (a) quantify how 13-month-olds (n = 39; 39% male) and 24-month-olds (n = 39; 59% male) adapt gait based on task (carrying vs. not carrying objects), object characteristics (size and weight), and environmental constraints (free play vs. structured) and to (b) assess how changes in gait relate to language abilities. To assess gait differences, Midwestern participants engaged in a free-play session and structured task with toys varying in size and weight while wearing motion capture markers. Parents completed an age-appropriate version of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory to measure language abilities. During free play, 13-month-olds were selective when choosing what to carry basing their decisions on object weight over size and adapting their upper-body control based on weight. Neither age group modified lower-body gait due to object characteristics but did reorganize their upper-body control. These upper-body adaptations were dependent upon age, environmental context, and task. Importantly, more mature upper-body control and more time spent in motion during free play were significant predictors of 13-month-olds' language abilities. Gait improvements may offer new opportunities for language learning; increased stability may allow young children to better focus on the objects, potentially enhancing word learning opportunities. Early movements and functional behavior during free play may be important predictors underlying the association between the onset of walking and language development.

DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Prior research shows that when parents monitor, check, and assist in completing homework without an invitation, their children's motivation and academic achievement often decline. We propose that intrusive support from parents might also send the message that children are incompetent, especially if they believe their intelligence is fixed. We tested whether children's mindsets moderate the negative link between parents' intrusive homework support and achievement among first- and second-grade students followed for one academic year (Study 1, N = 563) and middle and high school students for two academic years (Study 2, N = 1,613). The samples were obtained from large urban areas in the United States. In both studies, intrusive homework support more strongly predicted a decrease in achievement over time for children with a fixed mindset. These findings suggest that the belief that intellectual ability cannot be changed may exacerbate the detrimental effects of uninvited help on academic work.

First, inhibitory control should be an independent predictor of fraction understanding, even after controlling for working memory. Second, if the source of interference is whole number knowledge, then it should hinder fraction understanding. These predictions were tested in a racially and socioeconomically diverse sample of U.S. children (N = 765; 337 female) in Grades 3 (ages 8-9), 5 (ages 10-11), and 7 (ages 12-13) who completed a battery of computerized tests. The fraction comparison task included problems with both shared components (e.g., 3/5 > 2/5) and distinct components (e.g., 2/3 > 5/9), and problems that were congruent (e.g., 5/6 > 3/4) and incongruent (e.g., 3/4 > 5/7) with whole number knowledge. Inhibitory control predicted fraction comparison performance over and above working memory across component and congruency types. Whole number knowledge did not hinder performance and instead positively predicted performance for fractions with shared components. These results highlight a role for inhibitory control in rational number understanding and suggest that its contribution may be distinct from inhibiting whole number magnitude knowledge.

We recruited 134 solo mothers and 161 married mothers during pregnancy, most representing the middle to upper socioeconomic class in Israel. Assessments were conducted during pregnancy and at 4 and 8 months postpartum. Maternal and infant sleep were assessed with actigraphy and sleep diaries for 7 nights. Questionnaires were used to assess maternal insomnia symptoms, sleepiness, sleeping arrangements, and background variables. The comparison of sleep between solo-mother and two-parent families, at each assessment point, showed no differences in sleep duration, and only a few differences in sleep quality measures; these were partially explained by maternal age and breastfeeding. Nevertheless, solo mothers were more likely to share a bed with their infants. In both groups, trajectory analyses showed a decrease in maternal actigraphic and diary sleep quality measures from pregnancy to 4 months, followed by an increase from 4 to 8 months. However, maternal insomnia symptoms first declined, and then increased, and maternal sleep duration first lengthened and then shortened. Infant actigraphic and diary sleep quality increased in both groups from 4 to 8 months, whereas sleep duration decreased only in the "solo" group. In general, the findings suggest that objective and subjective sleep quality and sleep duration of solo-mother families, a growing yet unexplored family structure, do not seem to be significantly affected by the absence of a second parent.

Familism Values and Psychological Adjustment of Latinx Adolescents in an Emerging Immigrant Community: A Five Wave Longitudinal Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examined the relations between normative developmental changes of familism values and later internalizing and externalizing behaviors in Latinx adolescents from an emerging immigrant community. The sample included 547 Latinx adolescents (55.4% female; baseline M-age = 12.80; SD = 1.03) residing in the Southeastern United States. Results from latent growth models indicated that higher initial levels of familism values (intercept) and slower declines (slope) in familism values across adolescence predicted lower internalizing and externalizing behaviors at a later time. These associations generalized across adolescent gender (boys and girls) and ethnic background (Mexican-origin vs. other Latinx-origin). This work highlights the impact of variation in normative developmental changes in familism values on adjustment among Latinx adolescents in an emerging immigrant community context.					, Rebecca/K-4746-2019	Kho, Carmen/0000-0002-6944-1790													0012-1649	1939-0599				JUL	2023	59	7					1315	1326		10.1037/dev0001554	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001554		MAY 2023						37166864					WOS:000985552700001

However, evidence on the joint development of self-regulated learning and externally regulated learning during adolescence is lacking. In addition, the current knowledge on interrelations between the development of adolescents' self-regulated learning, externally regulated learning, behaviors of teachers and parents in terms of autonomy support and achievement pressure, and academic achievement is very limited. The present multilevel longitudinal analysis focusing on the domain of mathematics (N = 1,542 German adolescents; annual assessments from Grades 5 to 9; mean age at Grade 5 = 11.79 years, SD = 0.71, 51.75% female) addressed these gaps. Results from multilevel latent basic growth curve models showed that self- and externally regulated learning decreased over the 5 years at both the individual student and the class level. Changes in self- and externally regulated learning were linked: Classes with higher levels of self-regulated learning at Grade 5 showed a stronger decrease in externally regulated learning over time. Initial levels of and changes in student-reported teacher and parental autonomy support and achievement pressure were associated with self- and externally regulated learning at the individual student level; student-reported teacher autonomy support and self-regulated learning were also linked at the class level. Self-regulated learning related positively to standardized achievement test scores but not to adolescents' grades. This study adds to the scarce evidence base on different regulatory forms of adolescents' learning and can inform future research on adolescents' positive development and educational practice.

J	Deutchman, P; McAuliffe, K				Deutchman, Paul; McAuliffe, Katherine			Children Use Common Knowledge to Solve Coordination Problems	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Recent work suggests that common knowledge is an important cognitive mechanism for coordinating prosocial behavior, in part because it reduces uncertainty about others' cooperative behavior. However, it remains unclear whether children also rely on common knowledge to solve coordination problems. Here we examined whether 6- to 9-year-old children (N = 133) from the United States were more likely to attempt to coordinate when they had common knowledge about a joint payoff. Participants saw 3 vignettes that modeled the structure of a 2-player coordination problem and were provided with common knowledge, secondary knowledge, or private knowledge about the mutually beneficial, but risky, joint payoff. By 6 years of age, participants were more likely to attempt to coordinate when they had common knowledge than secondary knowledge, and secondary knowledge than private knowledge. Participants were also most likely to expect the other player to coordinate, and were most certain in their predictions, when there was common knowledge. Results indicate that, by middle childhood, children are able to solve coordination problems by relying on common knowledge, in part because it likely increases their certainty in others' cooperative behavior. Overall, findings suggest that common knowledge is an important cognitive mechanism for coordinating behavior and that it does so by reducing uncertainty about others' cooperative behavior.

M.; Taylor, Alex H.; Redshaw, Jonathan			Creativity and Flexibility in Young Children's Use of External Cognitive Strategies	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												A cardinal feature of adult cognition is the awareness of our own cognitive struggles and the capacity to draw upon this awareness to offload internal demand into the environment. In this preregistered study conducted in Australia, we investigated whether 3-8-year-olds (N = 72, 36 male, 36 female, mostly White) could self-initiate such an external metacognitive strategy and transfer it across contexts. Children watched as an experimenter demonstrated how to mark the location of a hidden prize, thus helping them successfully retrieve that prize in the future. Children were then given the opportunity to spontaneously adopt an external marking strategy across six test trials. Children who did so at least once were then introduced to a conceptually similar but structurally distinct transfer task. Although most 3-year-olds deployed the demonstrated strategy in the initial test phase, none of them modified that strategy to solve the transfer task. By contrast, many children aged 4 years and older spontaneously devised more than one previously unseen reminder-setting strategy across the six transfer trials, with this tendency increasing with age. From age 6, children deployed effective external strategies on most trials, with the number, combination, and order of unique strategies used varying widely both within and across the older age groups. These results demonstrate young children's remarkable flexibility in the transferral of external strategies across contexts and point to pronounced individual differences in the strategies children devise.

Bidirectional Associations Between Sleep Duration and Emotion Dysregulation Across Adolescence	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Throughout adolescence, both sleep and emotion regulation abilities undergo significant developmental changes. The maturational systems that govern sleep and emotion regulation are closely intertwined leading many researchers to posit a mutually reinforcing relationship. Although there is support for a bidirectional relationship among adults, empirical support for reciprocal relationships among adolescents is lacking. Given the notable developmental changes and instability that occur throughout adolescence, this is a critical period to examine whether sleep and emotion regulation abilities may be reciprocally related. Using a latent curve model with structured residuals, this study examined within-person reciprocal associations between sleep duration and emotion dysregulation among 12,711 Canadian adolescents (M-age = 14.30 years; 50% female). Participants self-reported their sleep duration and emotion dysregulation each year for 3 years beginning in Grade 9. After accounting for underlying developmental trajectories, the results did not support a bidirectional relationship between sleep duration and emotion dysregulation from one year to the next. However, there was evidence of contemporaneous associations between the residuals at each wave of assessment (r = -.12) such that less sleep than expected was concurrently associated with higher-than-expected deviations in emotion dysregulation, or, conversely, that reporting greater emotion dysregulation than expected was associated with lower-than-expected sleep duration. In contrast to previous findings, the between-person associations were not supported. Taken together, these results indicate that the relationship between sleep duration and emotion dysregulation is primarily a within-person process rather than reflecting differences between individuals and likely operates on a more proximal timescale.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				JUN	2023	59	6					1087	1097		10.1037/dev0001560	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001560		APR 2023						37104807					WOS:000978928500001
J	Török, G; Swaboda, N; Ruggeri, A				Torok, Georgina; Swaboda, Nora; Ruggeri, Azzurra			Smart or Just Lucky? Inferring Question-Asking Competence From Strategies' Efficiency Versus Effectiveness	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Previous research shows that children evaluate the competence of others based on how effectively someone accomplished a goal, that is, based on the observed outcome of an action (e.g., number of attempts needed). Here, we investigate whether 5- to 10-year-old children and adults infer competence from how efficiently someone solves a task by implementing question-asking strategies of varying expected information gains (EIG). Whereas the efficiency of a strategy defined as EIG is a reliable indicator of competence, the observed effectiveness of actions may depend on unrelated external factors, such as luck. Across two experiments conducted in Germany, we varied how efficiently and how effectively different agents solved a 20-questions game (Experiments 1 and 2) and a maze-exploration game (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1 (N = 121), only adults identified a more efficient agent as more competent, and all participants attributed higher competence to agents needing fewer questions even when they employed the same inefficient strategy. In Experiment 2 (N = 220), adults and children from about 8 years onward successfully identified the agents using the more efficient strategy as more competent. Overall, our results suggest that observed effectiveness is a powerful cue for competence even when such an inference may not be warranted and that the ability to make explicit competence judgments based on the efficiency of a strategy alone emerges around 8 years of age, although, as shown in previous work, a more implicit understanding of competence may already be present during the preschool years.

Participants were 7,110 children (49.4% male; 84.4% Irish), recruited between 2007 and 2008 in Ireland. Structural equation modeling revealed that only the informal HLE and HNE demonstrated both domain-specific and cross-domain positive effects on children's language and numeracy outcomes but not on socioemotional outcomes, at 5 and 9 years old. Effect sizes ranged from small (beta = 0.020) to moderate (beta = 0.209). These results suggest that even casual cognitively stimulating activities that do not directly focus on active teaching may benefit children's educational outcomes. Findings bear implications for cost-effective interventions with far-reaching, and enduring, effects across multiple child outcomes. Public Significance Statement This study suggests that informal home numeracy and literacy activities such as playing board games, card games, having access to books, and shared reading during toddlerhood may contribute to children's school performance during the preschool and early childhood years. These findings suggest that even home learning activities that are associated with fun and do not actively focus on teaching can positively influence children's skills across literacy and numeracy domains of development.

The impact of disclosure of their biological origins, and quality of mother-child relationships from age 3 onward, were also examined. Sixty-five assisted reproduction families, including 22 surrogacy families, 17 egg donation families, and 26 sperm donation families, were compared with 52 unassisted conception families when the children were aged 20. Less than half of themothers had completed tertiary education and less than 5% were from ethnic minority backgrounds. Standardized interviews and questionnaires were administered tomothers and young adults. Therewere no differences between assisted reproduction and unassisted conception families in mothers' or young adults' psychological well-being, or the quality of family relationships. However, within the gamete donation families, egg donation mothers reported less positive family relationships than sperm donation mothers, and young adults conceived by sperm donation reported poorer family communication than those conceived by egg donation. Young adults who learned about their biological origins before age 7 had less negative relationships with their mothers, and their mothers showed lower levels of anxiety and depression. Associations between parenting and child adjustment did not differ between assisted and unassisted reproduction families from ages 3 to 20. The findings suggest that the absence of a biological connection between children and their parents in assisted reproduction families does not interfere with the development of positive mother-child relationships or psychological adjustment in adulthood.

J	Burdett, ERR; Ronfard, S				Burdett, Emily R. R.; Ronfard, Samuel			Tinkering to Innovation: How Children Refine Tools Over Multiple Attempts	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The human capacity for technological innovation and creative problem-solving far surpasses that of any species but develops quite late. Prior work has typically presented children with problems requiring a single solution, a limited number of resources, and a limited amount of time. Such tasks do not allow children to utilize one of their strengths: their ability to engage in broad search and exploration. Thus, we hypothesized that a more open-ended innovation task might allow children to demonstrate greater innovative capacity by allowing them to discover and refine a solution over multiple attempts. Children were recruited from a museum and a children's science event in the United Kingdom. We presented 129 children (66 girls, M = 6.91, SD = 2.18) between 4 and 12 years old with a variety of materials and asked children to use those materials to create tools to remove rewards from a box within 10 min. We coded the variety of tools children created each time they attempted to remove the rewards. By comparing successive attempts, we were able to obtain insights about how children built successful tools. Consistent with prior research, we found that older children were more likely than younger children to create successful tools. However, controlling for age, children who engaged in more tinkering-who retained a greater proportion of objects from their failed tools in subsequent attempts and who added more novel objects to their tools following failure-were more likely to build successful tools than children who did not.

We utilize longitudinal structural equation modeling to understand how grades relate to task values, how task values across domains relate to one another over time, and how the system of task values relates to college major choice. In our sample of 1,279 high students from Michigan, we find evidence that task value for math negatively relates to task value for English and vice versa. We also find that task value for math and physical science positively relates to the math-intensiveness of selected college majors, whereas English and biology task value negatively relates to math-intensiveness of majors. Gender differences in college major selection are mediated by differences in task values. Our findings have implications for theories of achievement motivation and motivational interventions.

This study investigated 4-11-year-old children's (N = 127, M-age = 7.50, SDage = 2.27, 53% females, 75% White; from the Northeastern United States) beliefs about the mental, physical, emotional, and moral features of two familiar technologies (Amazon Alexa and Roomba) in comparison to their beliefs about a humanoid robot (Nao). Children's beliefs about the agency of these technologies were organized into three distinct clusters-having experiences, having minds, and deserving moral treatment. Children endorsed some agent-like features for each technology type, but the extent to which they did so declined with age. Furthermore, children's judgment of the technologies' freedom to "act otherwise" in moral scenarios changed with age, suggesting a development shift in children's understanding of technologies' limitations. Importantly, there were systematic differences between Alexa, Roomba, and Nao, that correspond to the unique characteristics of each. Together these findings suggest that children's intuitive theories of agency are informed by an increasingly technological world.

How Children Judge Affordances When Walking and Bicycling Across Virtual Roads: Does Mode of Locomotion Matter?	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This investigation examined whether the mode of locomotion matters in how 8-, 10-, 12-, and 14-year-old children (N = 91) judge dynamic affordances in a complex perception-action task with significant safety risks. The primarily European American children in the sample came from the area of Iowa City, Iowa and were balanced for gender. The same children crossed a single lane of continuous traffic on foot and on bike (order counterbalanced) in identical immersive virtual environments. We found that although 8-year-olds chose significantly larger gaps when crossing on bike than on foot, these gaps were not large enough to compensate for their delay in entering the gap and their slowness in crossing the road. As a result, they ended up with less time to spare when exiting the roadway on bike than on foot. In contrast, 14-year-olds exhibited no difference in their gap choices on bike than on foot, nor did they exhibit a difference in their timing of entry into the gap. However, they crossed the road much more quickly on bike, resulting in significantly more time to spare when crossing on bike than on foot. The 10- and 12-year-olds' performance fit neatly between that of the 8- and 14-year-olds. We conclude that as children gained better control over the bike with age, they were better able to match their gap decisions with their crossing movements such that bicycling afforded even safer road-crossing than walking for 14-year-olds.

Major Gender Differences in Relations Between Life Stressor Frequency and Gray Matter in Adolescence and Emerging Adulthood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Adolescence and emerging adulthood is likely a sensitive period for the neural effects of stress due to increasing life stress, onset of stress-related disorders, and continued gray matter (GM) development. In adults, stress is associated with GM differences in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), hippocampus, and amygdala, but little is known about these relations, and whether they differ by gender, during adolescence and emerging adulthood. Further, it is unknown whether dependent (self-generated) and independent (fateful) stressors have distinct associations with GM, as each have distinct relations with internalizing psychopathology. We tested relations between recent dependent and independent stressor frequency (ALEQ-R) and GM structure using MRI in a priori regions of interest (mPFC, amygdala, and hippocampus) and across the cortex in youth from the Denver/Boulder metro area ages 14-22 (N = 144). Across both genders, no effects passed multiple comparison correction (FDR q > .05). However, there were significant differences between male and female youth (FDR q < .05), with opposite relations between dependent stressor frequency and cortical GM thickness in the salience network and emotion regulation regions and with surface area in default mode network regions. These results motivate future investigations of gender differences in neural mechanisms of stress generation and reactivity.

The aim of the study was to investigate the relation between sibling differences in compliance and the within-family factors birth order and differential parenting, as well as interactions between these factors. Using observational data of 311 Dutch families (self-identified as culturally Dutch) with 2 children when each child was 3 and 4 years old (firstborns: 36.2 months old; SD = 3.6; 48% girls, second-borns (2 years later): 36.67 months old; SD = .62; 47% girls) and both parents. Three-level cross-classified multilevel models showed main effects of observed sibling noncompliance and differential verbal discipline on noncompliance. In addition, second-born children were more compliant than their firstborn siblings, but only when the firstborn was disciplined physically more often than his/her younger sibling. The results provide evidence that birth-order effects may partially be explained by differential parenting and suggest that differences between siblings cannot be fully understood without taking into account the influence of both direct and indirect sibling effects.

The sample's London, United Kingdom, school catchment areas ranged from low to high socioeconomic statuses with 31% to 49% of children from ethnic minority backgrounds. In Study 1, participants watched one of two films of a child playing a simple musical instrument (a kazoo). In one film, an audience of peers responds negatively to the performance. In the other film, the audience response was neutral. Participants were then filmed playing the instrument themselves and measures of perceived and actual heart rate were taken along with individual differences in trait social anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, and effortful control. To better understand findings from Study 1, Study 2 replicated Study 1 but added a manipulation check and measures of effortful control and self-reported anxiety. Multiple regression analyses found watching a negative performance film, compared with a neutral one, was associated with a blunted heart rate response for children with low effortful control (Study 1 and 2). These findings suggest that children who are low in effortful control may disengage during performance tasks if the situation's social threat is elevated. Hierarchical regression analyses found that, compared to the neutral film, the negative performance film elevated children's self-report anxiety (Study 2). Overall, the findings indicated that anxiety in performance situations can be elevated after observing peers' negative experiences.

Developmental Trajectories of Numerical Magnitude Representations of Fractions and Decimals	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We examined the development of numerical magnitude representations of fractions and decimals from fourth to 12th grade. In Experiment 1, we assessed the rational number magnitude knowledge of 200 Chinese fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth, and 12th graders (92 girls and 108 boys) by presenting fraction and decimal magnitude comparison tasks as well as fraction and decimal 0-1 and 0-5 number line estimation tasks. Magnitude representations of decimals became accurate earlier, improved more rapidly, and reached a higher asymptotic accuracy than magnitude representations of fractions. Analyses of individual differences revealed positive relations between the accuracy of decimal and fraction magnitude representations at all ages. In Experiment 2, we presented an additional set of 24 fourth graders (14 girls and 10 boys) with the same tasks but with the decimals that were being compared varying in the number of decimal digits. The decimal advantage continued to be present for both magnitude comparison and estimation tasks, indicating that the greater accuracy with decimals was not limited to decimals with equal numbers of decimal digits, though unequal numbers of decimal digits did impact performance with decimals on both magnitude comparison and number line estimation tasks. Implications for understanding numerical development and education are discussed.

Preliminary Evidence for Progressions in Ownership Reasoning Over the Preschool Period	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Defining developmental progressions can be an important step in identifying developmental precursors and mechanisms of change, within and across areas of reasoning. In one exploratory study, we examine whether the development of children's thinking about ownership follows a systematic progression wherein some components emerge reliably before others. We examine this issue in a sample of 72 children: 40 older 2-year-olds, M-age = 2.78 (.14); R = 2.50-3.00, and 32 older 4-year-olds, M-age = 4.77 (.16); R = 4.50-5.00, living in Michigan in the United States. We use a battery of four established ownership tasks that tested different aspects of children's ownership thinking. A Guttman test revealed a reliable sequence that explained 81.9% of children's performance. Namely, we discovered that identifying familiar owned objects emerged first, control of permission as a cue to ownership second, understanding ownership transfers third, and the tracking of sets of identical objects last. This ordering suggests two foundational ownership abilities on which more complex reasoning may be built: the ability to include information about familiar owners in children's mental models of objects and recognizing that control is central to ownership. The observed progression is an important first step toward developing a formal ownership scale. This study paves the way for mapping the conceptual and information-processing demands (e.g., executive functioning, memory) that likely underlie change in ownership thinking across childhood.

Sustained Musical Beat Perception Develops Into Late Childhood and Predicts Phonological Abilities	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Sensitivity to auditory rhythmic structures in music and language is evident as early as infancy, but performance on beat perception tasks is often well below adult levels and improves gradually with age. While some research has suggested the ability to perceive musical beat develops early, even in infancy, it remains unclear whether adult-like perception of musical beat is present in children. The capacity to sustain an internal sense of the beat is critical for various rhythmic musical behaviors, yet very little is known about the development of this ability. In this study, 223 participants ranging in age from 4 to 23 years from the Las Vegas, Nevada, community completed a musical beat discrimination task, during which they first listened to a strongly metrical musical excerpt and then attempted to sustain their perception of the musical beat while listening to a repeated, beat-ambiguous rhythm for up to 14.4 s. They then indicated whether a drum probe matched or did not match the beat. Results suggested that the ability to identify the matching probe improved throughout middle childhood (8-9 years) and did not reach adult-like levels until adolescence (12-14 years). Furthermore, scores on the beat perception task were positively related to phonological processing, after accounting for age, short-term memory, and music and dance training. This study lends further support to the notion that children's capacity for beat perception is not fully developed until adolescence and suggests we should reconsider assumptions of musical beat mastery by infants and young children.

J	Sullivan, J; Tillman, K; Shtulman, A				Sullivan, Jessica; Tillman, Katharine; Shtulman, Andrew			Stay Away, Santa: Children's Beliefs About the Impact of COVID-19 on Real and Fictional Beings	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The COVID-19 pandemic has forced children to reckon with the causal relations underlying disease transmission. What are children's theories of how COVID-19 is transmitted? And how do they understand the relation between COVID-19 susceptibility and the need for disease-mitigating behavior? We asked these questions in the context of children's beliefs about supernatural beings, like Santa and the Tooth Fairy. Because these beings cannot be observed, children's beliefs about the impact of COVID-19 on them must be based on their underlying theories of disease transmission and prevention rather than on experience. In the summer of 2020, N = 218 U.S. children between the ages of 3 and 10 years (M = 81.2 months) were asked to rate supernatural beings' susceptibility to COVID-19, and the extent to which these beings should engage in disease-mitigating behaviors, such as social distancing and mask wearing. Many children believed supernatural beings were susceptible to COVID-19. However, children rated the need for supernatural beings to engage in disease-mitigating behaviors as higher than the beings' disease susceptibility, indicating a disconnect between their conceptions of the causal relations between disease-mitigating behavior and disease prevention. Children's belief that a particular supernatural being could be impacted by COVID-19 was best predicted by the number of human-like properties they attributed to it, regardless of the child's age. Together, these findings suggest that although young children fail to appreciate specific pathways of disease transmission, they nonetheless understand disease as a bodily affliction, even for beings whose bodies have never been observed.

" The present research probed for evidence of the homophily principle in 4- to 6-year-old children. Across two experiments, participants (N = 327; 166 girls, 161 boys; located in the Midwestern United States) were asked to predict the closeness of two people based on their preferences. Participants in Experiment 1 indicated that people with a shared preference or a shared dispreference were more closely affiliated than people whose preferences diverged, suggesting inferences of homophily. Furthermore, children were not only relying on the emotional valences expressed: They expected people with a shared preference to be closer than people who expressed positive emotions about different items and expected people with a shared dispreference to be closer than people who expressed negative emotions about different items. Experiment 2 replicated and extended the main findings of Experiment 1 with more naturalistic stimuli. The present studies provide strong evidence that young children apply the homophily principle to their reasoning about social relationships.

Understanding of Spatial Correspondence Does Not Contribute to Representational Understanding: Evidence From the Model Room and False Belief Tasks	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We examine the long-standing claim that understanding relational correspondence is a general component of representational understanding. Two experiments with 175 preschool children located in Norwich, United Kingdom, examined the use of a scale model comparing performances on a "copy " task, measuring abstract spatial arrangement ability, and the false belief task. Consistent with previous studies, younger children performed well in scale model trials when objects were unique (e.g., one cupboard) but poorly at distinguishing objects using spatial layout (one of three identical chairs). Performance was specifically associated with Copy task but not False Belief performance. Emphasizing the representational relation between the model and the room was ineffective. We find no evidence for understanding relational correspondence as a general component of representational understanding.

However, few studies have considered how maternal and paternal supportive parenting may interact to impact child development. Thus, the present study assessed direct and moderated longitudinal relations between maternal and paternal supportive parenting in toddlerhood (24 and 36 months, respectively) and fathers' and teachers' reports of children's socioemotional and behavioral adjustment in first grade. Data were drawn from a large, sample of Norwegian parents and children (N = 455, 51% female, 49% male, 10% endorsed financial strain, 75% of fathers and 86% of mothers born in Norway). After controlling for child temperamental activity level and soothability in infancy, path analysis revealed that higher paternal supportive parenting was associated with fewer symptoms of father-reported child hyperactivity/impulsivity in first grade. In addition, a significant interaction between maternal and paternal supportive parenting was evident for three out of the four assessed outcomes (per both father- and teacher-reports): externalizing problems, hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms, and social skills. Simple slope analyses revealed a negative relation between parental supportive parenting and children's externalizing (father-reported) and hyperactivity/impulsivity problems (father- and teacher-reported) when the child's other parent engaged in low levels of supportive parenting. Similarly, paternal supportive parenting was positively associated with children's social skills (father-report) when mothers engaged in low levels of supportive parenting. Results are discussed with implications for including both mothers and fathers in early childhood research, intervention, and social policy. Public Significance StatementThe present study found that the strength of relations between parental supportive parenting and children's school-age behavioral and social adjustment, as rated by fathers and teachers, was moderated by levels of supportive parenting demonstrated by the child's other parent.					wang, yan/G-3715-2018; Feldman, Julia/AAH-9588-2020	Feldman, Julia/0000-0003-2230-2336													0012-1649	1939-0599				JUN	2023	59	6					1074	1086		10.1037/dev0001523	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001523		MAR 2023						36877461					WOS:000943283100001

Categories are ubiquitous across modalities, supporting complex processes such as object recognition and speech perception. Prior work has proposed that different categories may engage learning systems with unique developmental trajectories. There is a limited understanding of how perceptual and cognitive development influences learning as prior studies have examined separate participants in a single modality. The current study presents a comprehensive assessment of category learning in 8-12-year-old children (12 female; 34 white, 1 Asian, 1 more than one race; M household income $85-$100 K) and 18-61-year-old adults (13 female; 32 white, 10 Black or African American, 4 Asian, 2 more than one race, 1 other; M household income $40-55 K) in a broad sample collected online from the United States. Across multiple sessions, participants learned categories across modalities (auditory, visual) that engage different learning systems (explicit, procedural). Unsurprisingly, adults outperformed children across all tasks. However, this enhanced performance was asymmetrical across categories and modalities. Adults far outperformed children in learning visual explicit categories and auditory procedural categories, with fewer differences across development for other types of categories. Adults' general benefit over children was due to enhanced information processing, while their superior performance for visual explicit and auditory procedural categories was associated with less cautious correct responses. These results demonstrate an interaction between perceptual and cognitive development that influences learning of categories that may correspond to the development of real-world skills such as speech perception and reading.

Life Transition Events and Depressive Symptom Trajectories During Young Adulthood: The Influence of Adverse Family and Individual Contexts in Adolescence	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Because sequential patterns of multiple transition events (i.e., college graduation, full-time employment, marriage, and parenthood) are associated with turning points in depressive symptom trajectories during young adulthood, the present study used a sample of 446 White adolescents (52.3% females; 15.58 years old, on average) over 18 years (1992 to 2010) to (a) identify distinct longitudinal joint processes between these sequential patterns of life transition events and turning points of depressive symptom trajectories by using a person-centered modeling approach and (b) investigate the influence of adverse family and individual contexts (negative family economic events, hostile relationships with parents, and impulsive sensation seeking) in adolescence on these longitudinal joint processes. We identified six longitudinal joint processes: (a) traditional transition pattern with no turning points in depressive symptom trajectories, (b) traditional transition pattern with turning points in depressive symptom trajectories in the mid-to-late 20s, (c) early parenthood transition pattern with no turning points in depressive symptom trajectories, (d) early parenthood transition pattern with turning points in depressive symptom trajectories in the mid-to-late 20s, (e) precocious transition pattern with no turning points in depressive symptom trajectories, and (f) precocious transition pattern with depressive symptom turning points (or fluctuations) throughout young adulthood. Negative family economic events, hostile relationships with parents, and impulsive sensation seeking in adolescence influenced these longitudinal joint processes. Hostile relationships with parents also uniquely influenced turning points in depressive symptoms during young adulthood while impulsive sensation seeking uniquely influence sequential patterns of life transition events. Clinical implications are discussed.

However, this association may reflect many potential mechanisms. Capturing dynamic fluctuations in mothers' states simultaneously with caregiving experiences is necessary to identify the real-time processes influencing mental health. In this study, we leveraged ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) and infant-worn audio recorders to capture variability in mothers' mental health symptoms and their exposure to infant crying over one week in a racially and socio-economically diverse urban North-American sample (N= 53). We use multilevel modeling to characterize within-and between-person effects of crying on maternal negative affect and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Within participants, when infants cried more than average in the 10 min, 1 hr, and 8 hr prior to an EMA report, mothers' negative affect subsequently increased, controlling for mean levels of infant crying. In contrast to findings from laboratory studies, in everyday settings crying exposure did not immediately increase feelings of depression. Only when crying was above average for 8 hr prior to EMA did mothers report increases in subsequent depression symptoms, suggesting that the effects of crying on maternal mental health take hours to unfold in ecologically valid home settings. Between participants, mothers of infants who cried more on average did not report higher negative affect or symptoms of depression or anxiety. Overall, our findings reveal that crying exposure dynamically influences maternal negative affect and depression but not anxiety in ecologically valid real-world settings.

Study With Toddlers and Preschool Children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Young children from a very early age not only prefer those who help others but also those who engage in altruistic helping. This study aims to test how children assess helping when the goal of the helping behavior is immoral. We argue that younger children consider only the helping versus hindering behavior, but older children distinguish their judgments depending on the goal to which the helping leads. In the study involving 727 European children aged 2-7 years (354 girls, M = 53.82 months, SD = 18.76), we found that children aged 2-4 years assessed helping as always morally good and hindering as morally bad, no matter the recipient's intention. Only children aged 4.5-7 years assessed helping in an immoral act as immoral and hindering in an immoral act as moral. We also found that younger children liked the helper regardless of the goal that their helping behavior led to, but from the age of 5, children preferred characters who hindered in an immoral act rather than those who helped. Our study extends the previous research, showing how children's moral judgments of helping behavior develop and become more complex as children get older.

COVID-19 has complicated this process; behaviors generally considered praiseworthy were considered problematic during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study examined whether 6-to 12 year-olds (N = 228; residing in the United States) adapt their evaluations of helpful behavior in response to shifting norms. Specifically, we presented children with scenarios featuring helpful and unhelpful actions that involved physical interaction (e.g., hugging) or nonphysical interaction (e.g., recruiting a teacher); although all children were tested during the COVID-19 pandemic, stories portrayed individuals either before or during COVID-19. While children generally judged helpfulness positively and unhelpfulness negatively, children exhibited a selective shift in their judgments for COVID-19 scenarios: children considered helpfulness negatively and unhelpfulness positively if helping required physical interaction. These findings demonstrate that children flexibly tune their social evaluations of helping to align with evolving norms.

J	Hwang, HG; Markson, L				Hwang, Hyesung G.; Markson, Lori			Black and White Children's Race-Based Information Endorsement and Teacher Preference: Effects of School and Neighborhood Racial Demographics	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The current study examined whether racially minoritized children and racial majority children demonstrate different race-based learning preferences and whether the racial demographics of their schools and neighborhoods predict these preferences. Race-based information endorsement and teacher preferences of Black and White 3-to 7-year-old children (n = 238) recruited from a metropolitan area in the midwestern United States were examined. Across racially homogeneous and diverse schools, both Black and White children showed a White preference in information endorsement and teacher preference. Black and White children did not differ in their information endorsement, but they did differ in their teacher preferences: Black children chose Black teachers more than White children. Further, children overall chose the accurate adult as their teacher regardless of the adult's race, but the racial demographics of children's schools and neighborhoods related to these responses: Three-year-old children were more likely to select the accurate Black adult over the inaccurate White adult if there were more Black teachers in their schools and larger Black populations in their neighborhoods. Exploratory analyses indicated that 5-to 7-year-old White children who had non-White classroom teachers chose Black adults more than those who had White classroom teachers, but classroom teacher's race did not relate to Black children's teacher preference. The findings suggest that both microlevel factors (e.g., children's classroom teachers) and macrolevel factors (e.g., proportion of Black teachers in children's schools and Black population in their neighborhoods) could influence who children choose to learn from and prefer as teachers.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				MAY	2023	59	5					893	907		10.1037/dev0001507	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001507		JAN 2023						36634004					WOS:000912114900001

Children aged 5 to 12 years (N = 206; 109 boys, 97 girls; 55% White; 68% of household incomes > $75,000/year), recruited from a science museum in a large multicultural Canadian city, completed a child-friendly Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald et al., 2003) that included own-gender Black and other-gender White targets. Children were randomly assigned to complete this IAT under one of three categorization conditions. When asked to categorize targets by gender as opposed to race, both girls and boys showed relatively more positive associations with own-gender Black targets over other-gender White targets. Children in a third, Ambiguous-Categorization (AC-IAT; Lipman et al., 2021) condition, which allowed for categorization by gender and/or race, were more likely to spontaneously categorize additional final trials primarily by gender (70%), suggesting that gender was the more salient social category. However, girls' and boys' biases in this condition differed, with girls showing relatively more positive associations with own-gender Black targets (Black girls > White boys) and boys showing relatively more positive associations with other-gender White targets (White girls > Black boys). In addition, the more boys and girls categorized by gender (over race) at the end of the task, the more they showed positive associations with own-gender Black targets over other-gender White targets. These findings provide insight into children's social categorization processes and biases toward targets who differ by race and gender.

Mind-Bending Geometry: Children's and Adults' Intuitions About Linearity on Spheres	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Humans appear to intuitively grasp definitions foundational to formal geometry, like definitions that describe points as infinitely small and lines as infinitely long. Nevertheless, previous studies exploring human's intuitive natural geometry have consistently focused on geometric principles in planar Euclidean contexts and thus may not comprehensively characterize humans' capacity for geometric reasoning. The present study explores whether children and adults can reason about linearity in spherical contexts. We showed 48 children (age range: 6-8 years) and 48 adults from the U.S. Northeast two different paths between the same two points on pictures of spheres and asked them to judge which path was the most efficient for an actor to get from a starting point to a goal object. In one kind of trial, both paths looked curved in the pictures, and in another kind of trial, the correct curved-looking path was paired with an incorrect straight-looking path. Adults were successful on both kinds of trials, and although children often chose the incorrect straight-looking path, they were surprisingly successful at identifying the efficient path when comparing two that were curved. Children thus may build on a natural geometry that gives us humans intuitions that are not limited to the formal axioms of Euclidean geometry or even to the Euclidean plane.

However, much of the literature uses mostly White, middle to high socioeconomic status (SES) samples despite evidence that the benefits of mind-mindedness may vary based on degree of social risk. Additionally, few studies have examined relations between mind-mindedness and language development. The current study investigates whether mind-mindedness predicts children's language development and behavioral functioning and if family history of childhood maltreatment moderates the relation of mind-mindedness to these outcomes. Participants were 98 mothers (49.0% Black, 24.5% White, 13.3% Latina, 7.2% multiracial; 81.6% low SES per Hollingshead classifications) and their children (49 boys, 49 girls) from the Rochester, New York area recruited at Time 1 (M-age = 13.34 months) and followed up twice (M-ages = 27.51 [Time 2] and 39.31 months [Time 3]). Mother-child dyads participated in videotaped free play interactions at Times 1 and 2. Using transcripts of these interactions, we coded mind-mindedness at Times 1 and 2 and children's internal state language at Time 2. Mothers reported on children's behavioral functioning at Time 3. Findings revealed that Time 2 mind-mindedness predicted fewer Time 3 behavioral difficulties in children from maltreating families but did not predict behavioral difficulties in children from nonmaltreating families. Additionally, Time 1 mind-mindedness predicted children's Time 2 use of decontextualized internal state language. Findings highlight the importance of examining mind-mindedness in higher risk populations and how mind-mindedness can be leveraged as a protective factor to prevent future maladjustment in children at risk for adverse outcomes.

M.; Nielsen, Mark			I May Not Like You, but I Still Care: Children Differentiate Moral Concern From Other Constructs	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												In industrialized societies, adults exhibit stable preferences for the types of people, animals, and entities they feel moral concern for (Crimston et al., 2016). Only one published study to date has utilized the moral circles paradigm to examine these preferences in children, finding that as children age, their preferences shift to become more similar to adults' (Neldner et al., 2018). However, it is currently unclear whether children's conceptualization of moral concern differs from that of other related social constructs. The aim of the current study was twofold: first, to test the moral circles paradigm in a new sample of children to see whether published patterns of moral concern could be replicated and, second, to investigate whether children distinguish moral concern from the related constructs of liking and familiarity. Australian children aged 4 to 10 years old (N = 281; 143 boys, 138 girls; predominantly middle class) placed 24 pictures of human, animal, and environmental entities on a stratified circle according to how much they cared, liked, or knew about the targets. We found similar patterns of moral prioritization to previous research (Neldner et al., 2018), replicating both stable preferences and age-related changes in children's moral concern for others. Crucially, we extend these findings by showing that children distinguish how much they care about entities from their levels of liking and knowing about them. This suggests children differentiate between moral concern and other social constructs early in development and display distinct patterns of prioritization when evaluating everyday entities according to these judgments.

The Emergence of Procrastination in Early Childhood: Relations With Executive Control and Future-Oriented Cognition	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Little is known about the development of procrastination, the tendency to postpone undesirable but necessary tasks, during early childhood. Only one study has measured procrastination behavior in preschool children using a single behavioral task (Sutter et al., 2018). Thus, the present study investigated the emergence and development of everyday procrastination behavior in preschool children and to explore its relations with executive function and future thinking using an adapted version of Lay's (1986) General Procrastination Scale for use with parents of preschool children. Parents (81% White, 82% with an annual household income of over $40,000, and 92% had a postsecondary education) of 3- to 6-year-olds (N = 396; 175 girls) completed the Preschool Procrastination Scale, the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool Version (Gioia et al., 2003), and the Children's Future Thinking Questionnaire (Mazachowsky & Mahy, 2020). Naturalistic examples of children's procrastination behavior were collected to better understand the domains in which preschool children procrastinated. Results revealed that: (a) procrastination emerges early in preschool, (b) procrastination became more characteristic with age, (c) executive function and future thinking were negatively related to procrastination tendencies, (d) different components of future thinking and executive function predicted younger and older children's procrastination, and (e) children procrastinated in different domains depending on their age and responsibilities. Our results suggest that children's procrastination tendencies increase with age and develop alongside self-regulatory and future-oriented cognitive abilities. Public Significance Statement Little is known about the development of procrastination during early childhood. A parent-report measure of preschool procrastination was developed to determine whether preschool children put off undesirable tasks. Older preschool children were found to have a higher tendency to procrastinate than younger preschool children. Children with poorer parent-reported executive function and future thinking also had a higher tendency to procrastinate. Children procrastinated different types of tasks depending on their age.

When children (N = 156; 55% male; United States; Representation by Race: 60% African American, 18% Mixed race, 15% European American, 7% Other; Representation by Latino/a Ethnicity: 22% Latino/a, 78% Not Latino/a; M-income = $39,419) were 8 years old, we assessed their aggressive and prosocial SIP using the Social Information Processing Application (SIP-AP). When children were 9 years old, they participated in playgroups typically consisting of four same-sex unfamiliar children who interacted in a round-robin format. Each dyad completed a five-minute frustration task and a five-minute planning task. Observers coded children's verbalizations into six prosocial categories (Suggest, Agree, Solicit Input, Ask, Encourage, State Personal) and four antisocial categories (Command, Disagree, Discourage, Aggress). Children with higher aggressive SIP made more antisocial and fewer prosocial statements, whereas children with higher prosocial SIP made more prosocial and fewer antisocial statements. Furthermore, children with higher aggressive SIP elicited more antisocial and fewer prosocial statements from peers, whereas children with higher prosocial SIP elicited more prosocial and fewer antisocial statements from peers. Children's antisocial and prosocial remarks mediated relations between their aggressive SIP and peers' subsequent antisocial and prosocial remarks. Findings are discussed in terms of: (a) the use of SIP to predict more subtle social behaviors in children's social interaction, and (b) cycles of social interactions that maintain and reinforce children's SIP patterns.

The aim of the study was to investigate the relation between sibling differences in compliance and the within-family factors birth order and differential parenting, as well as interactions between these factors. Using observational data of 311 Dutch families (self-identified as culturally Dutch) with 2 children when each child was 3 and 4 years old (firstborns: 36.2 months old; SD = 3.6; 48% girls, second-borns (2 years later): 36.67 months old; SD = .62; 47% girls) and both parents. Three-level cross-classified multilevel models showed main effects of observed sibling noncompliance and differential verbal discipline on noncompliance. In addition, second-born children were more compliant than their firstborn siblings, but only when the firstborn was disciplined physically more often than his/her younger sibling. The results provide evidence that birth-order effects may partially be explained by differential parenting and suggest that differences between siblings cannot be fully understood without taking into account the influence of both direct and indirect sibling effects.

DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Gender and age are salient social categories from early in development. However, whether children's beliefs about gender and age intersect, such that gender stereotypes might be expressed differently when asked about children (compared to adults) has not been investigated. Here, in a preregistered study (N = 297), we examined if young children (3.0-6.9-year-olds, M-age = 5.03 years, n = 145) and adults (n = 152) across Massachusetts were more likely to express gender stereotypes when presented with child or adult stimuli. Participants were presented with 20 questions about gender stereotyped behavioral and psychological properties and selected their response (male or female) for each question by selecting between four child faces (two White boys, two White girls) or four adult faces (two White men, two White women) across two separate blocks. Overall, both children and adults expressed gender stereotypes above chance, and, in children, expression of stereotypes increased across the age range. Although neither children nor adults applied gender stereotypes differently to child versus adult visual stimuli, all participants were more likely to apply gender stereotypes when that stereotype was child-centric (e.g., about doing childish activities). Our results suggest that children could be vulnerable to stereotype content from an early age; however, future research should explore whether children show this same age-invariant pattern when both gender and age are made salient and directly contrasted (e.g., by presenting men, women, boys, and girls simultaneously).

Subjectivity and Social Constitution: Contrasting Conceptions of Institutions, Artifacts, and Animals	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We systematically compared beliefs about animal (e.g., lion), artifactual (e.g., hammer), and institutional (e.g., police officer) categories, aiming to identify whether people draw different inferences about which categories are subjective and which are socially constituted. We conducted two studies with 270 American children, ages 4 through 10: 140 girls, 129 boys, one not reported; 59% White, 3% Black, 10% Asian, one Native American, 17% multiracial or another race, 11% unreported. We also conducted two studies with 360 American adults recruited from Amazon mechanical Turk. In all four studies we found that children and adults judged institutional categories as more socially constituted than artifactual categories (in all studies) but as less subjective (in three of four studies). Whereas younger and older children's beliefs about subjectivity were similar, younger and older children expressed different beliefs about social constitution. Young children judged none of the category domains as socially constituted; older children differentiated between the three domains. These results support the conceptual independence of subjectivity and social constitution and suggest that concepts of institutions and artifacts differ.

Momentary Links Between Adolescents' Social Media Use and Social Experiences and Motivations: Individual Differences by Peer Susceptibility	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This longitudinal ecological momentary assessment study examined whether adolescents' use of social media to interact with peers relates to their experiences of social connectedness, social craving, and sensation seeking on an hourly level. Further, we investigated whether these associations differ for adolescents who were nominated by their peers as more or less susceptible to social influences, because highly susceptible youth may be more strongly impacted by social media due to heightened focus on peer behaviors and social feedback. The sample was 212 adolescents in the southeastern United States (Mage = 15 years; range 14 to 17; 56.2% female; 40% White, 28% Latinx, 26% African American, 15% mixed/other race). Controlling for both daily and between-subjects effects, we found a consistent pattern of hourly level results that were robust to sensitivity analyses. When highly susceptible adolescents used social media to interact with peers in the last hour, they felt less socially connected to others and more strongly craved social connections and novel sensations. Youth who are particularly sensitive to social input from peers may feel less connected to others and crave more connections and exciting stimuli within 1 hr after using social media to interact with peers.

Experience With Pointing Gestures Facilitates Infant Vocabulary Growth Through Enhancement of Sensorimotor Brain Activity	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Exposure to communicative gestures, through their parents' use of gestures, is associated with infants' language development. However, the mechanisms supporting this link are not fully understood. In adults, sensorimotor brain activity occurs while processing communicative stimuli, including both spoken language and gestures. Using electroencephalogram (EEG) mu rhythm desynchronization (mu ERD), a marker of sensorimotor activity, we examined whether experimental manipulation of infants' exposure to gestures would affect language development, and specifically whether such an effect would be mediated by changes in sensorimotor brain activity. Mu ERD was measured in 10- to 12-month-old infants (N = 81; 42 male; 15% Hispanic, 62% White) recruited from counties surrounding a large mid-Atlantic university while they observed an experimenter gesturing toward or grasping an object. Half of the infants were randomized to receive increased gesture exposure through a parent-directed training. All 81 infants provided behavioral (infant and parent pointing and infant vocabulary) data prior to intervention and 72 provided behavioral data postintervention. Forty-two infants provided usable (post artifact removal) EEG data prior to intervention and 40 infants provided usable EEG data post-intervention. Twenty-nine infants provided usable EEG data at both sessions. Increased parent gesture due to the intervention was associated with increased infant right lateralized mu ERD at follow-up, but only while observing the experimenter gesturing not grasping. Increased mu ERD, again only while observing the experimenter gesture, was associated with increased infant receptive vocabulary. This is the first evidence suggesting that increasing exposure to gestures may impact infants' language development through an effect on sensorimotor brain activity.

Little is known about the importance of heterogeneous patterns that exist within these individual differences. A person-centered analytic approach might be helpful to unravel these patterns and the cognitive and environmental factors that are associated with them. We applied a person-centered approach to a 5-year longitudinal study (N = 410, 213 boys) conducted in Belgium from preschool to grade 3. Preschoolers (M-age = 58.14 months, SDage = 3.51) were selected to represent the full range of socioeconomic backgrounds. We examined via Latent Profile Analysis the heterogeneous patterns that exist in preschoolers' early numerical development using measures of counting, numeral identification, comparison, ordering, and arithmetic abilities. We investigated the association between the derived numerical ability pathways, general cognitive factors (working memory, language, spatial ability) and the home math environment. We also evaluated the relation of these early numerical ability pathways to later mathematics achievement in grade 1 and 3. Four longitudinal pathways emerged: a low (15%), below-average (28%), above-average (44%), and a high numerical ability pathway (13%). Differences between the four pathways were mostly quantitative. Most of the general cognitive factors contributed to pathway membership, whereas the home math environment and socioeconomic status (SES) did not. The pathways differed in mathematics achievement in grade 1 and 3, and most of these differences remained when the covariates were considered. The results highlight the heterogeneity that is already present in preschoolers' numerical abilities and their predictive value for subsequent mathematics achievement.

Studies have shown that 6-year-olds learning English and Japanese can use contrastive focus during online sentence comprehension: focus used in a contrastive context facilitates the identification of a target referent (speeding up processing), whereas focus used inappropriately in a noncontrastive context misleads listeners to predict an incorrect referent, hindering the identification process (Ito et al., 2012, 2014). In Mandarin Chinese, the mapping between prosodic form and contrastive focus is less transparent, potentially delaying the acquisition of contrastive focus. This study assessed the online processing of contrastive focus by 196 Mandarin-speaking 4-10-year-olds and 34 adults in China, using the visual world paradigm. Stimuli contained a target NP in a mini discourse, with focus being used in contrastive (Experiment 1) versus Noncontrastive contexts (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 showed that the appropriate use of prosodic form for contrastive focus facilitated the identification of a target referent for 7-10-year-olds and adults, though not younger children. Experiment 2 showed that the inappropriate use of prosodic form for contrastive focus slowed the identification process only for 10-year-olds and adults. Thus, whereas 7-10-year-olds are sensitive to prosodic form for contrastive focus, only 10-year-olds use it as a primary cue to predict an upcoming referent like adults. The acquisition of contrastive focus in Mandarin is therefore a gradual process, with children showing sensitivity to contrastive focus during the early school years, and developing adult-like form-function mapping between prosody and focus until the end of primary school.

Zoe			Yes, No, Maybe So: Caregiver Autonomy Support, Conversation Context, and Children's Memory Performance	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The extant literature on the use of autonomy support during caregiver-child conversations has focused primarily on conversations about fun, shared experiences, with limited consideration of unshared experiences or attention toward the role of conversation context. The present study examined how autonomy support, conversation context, and child age interact to predict 3-to-5-year-old children's disclosure of accurate information when discussing an unshared past event with their caregiver and an experimenter. Dyads (N = 111) were recruited from two locations (Miami, Florida and Orange County, California) by research recruitment firms. Children completed a standardized activity alone and then discussed the activity with their caregiver. The context of the discussion was manipulated so that dyads focused on either accumulating facts (Fact condition) or having fun (Fun condition). Afterward, children discussed the activity with a neutral interviewer. Caregivers in the fact condition were less autonomy supportive when discussing the activity than those in the fun condition. During the caregiver-child interview, caregiver autonomy support was negatively associated with children's disclosure of correct event details for those in the fun condition only. Caregiver autonomy support was negatively associated with children's correct details during the experiment-child interview across both context conditions. While older children provided more correct details during both interviews, there were no other age-related effects. These results demonstrate that conversation context moderates the link between autonomy support and children's autobiographical memory performance. Past contradictory findings in the field are discussed in light of these results.						Klemfuss, J.

Here we examined bidirectional relations between infant affect-biased attention, temperamental negative affect, and maternal anxiety symptoms using a Random Intercepts Cross-Lagged Panel model (RI-CLPM). Infant-mother pairs from Central Pennsylvania and Northern New Jersey (N = 342; 52% White; 50% reported as assigned female at birth) participated when infants were 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 months of age. Infants completed the overlap task while eye-tracking data were collected. Mothers reported their infant's negative affect and their own anxiety symptoms. In an RI-CLPM, after accounting for between-person variance (random intercepts representing the latent average of a construct), it is possible to assess within-person variance (individual deviations from the latent average of a construct). Positive relations represent stability in constructs (smaller within-person deviations). Negative relations represent fluctuation in constructs (larger within-person deviations). At the between-person level (random intercepts), mothers with greater anxiety symptoms had infants with greater affect-biased attention. However, at the within-person level (deviations), greater fluctuation in maternal anxiety symptoms at 12- and 18 months prospectively related to greater stability in attention to angry facial configurations. Additionally, greater fluctuation in maternal anxiety symptoms at 18 months prospectively related to greater stability in attention to happy facial configurations. Finally, greater fluctuation in maternal anxiety symptoms at 4- and 12 months prospectively related to greater stability in infant negative affect. These results suggest that environmental uncertainty, linked to fluctuating maternal anxiety, may shape early socioemotional development.

J	Xi, YM; Geva, E				Xi, Yueming; Geva, Esther			A 4-Year Longitudinal Study Examining Lexical and Syntactic Bootstrapping in English Language Learners (ELLs) and Their Monolingual Peers	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Current models of the affinity between syntax and vocabulary are complex and recognize the contribution of bootstrapping and computational processes. To date, the mutual facilitation between these two constructs over time has not been studied in second language (L2) school children. The present study investigated longitudinally the direction and strength of the associations between syntactic and vocabulary skills in English Language Learners (ELLs; N = 409, 204 females, M age = 78 months, low socioeconomic status backgrounds) and their monolingual English-speaking peers (EL1; N = 157, 92 females, M age = 77 months, low socioeconomic status backgrounds). Children were assessed annually from Grade 1 to Grade 4 on a syntactic and a vocabulary task. Overall, autoregressive cross-lagged analyses indicated that early syntax predicted later vocabulary and vice versa, yet, the magnitude of prediction varied across groups. Notably, in the early stages of L2 learning, the predictive power from vocabulary to syntax was stronger than that in the opposite direction. Moreover, the predictive power from vocabulary to syntax was consistently stronger in the ELL than in the EL1 group. The results suggest that, in general, with sufficient quantity and quality of exposure to the L2, lexical and syntactic bootstrapping coexist. However, among novice young ELLs, bootstrapping is stronger from vocabulary to syntax than the other way around. Results underscore the importance of studying the relations between vocabulary and syntax longitudinally, and caution about an injudicious application of L1-based models to young L2 children's language development.

The Influence of Books' Textual Features and Caregivers' Extratextual Talk on Children's Science Learning in the Context of Shared Book Reading	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												During early childhood, reading books with one's caregiver (shared book reading) is a valuable means of supporting learning. Yet, there are gaps in our understanding of the influence of shared book reading on young children's science learning. The current research bridges this gap by examining the pedagogical quality of science books in preschool-aged children's environments and investigating how such books influence children's learning and caregivers' extratextual talk during shared book reading. In Study 1, we coded 60 science books that were readily available in young children's environments within the United States. The books were designed for English speakers and recommended for preschool-aged children. We coded the books for the extent to which they were Coherent (elaborated on facts presented by providing details, examples, comparisons, etc.) and included Embedded Questions. However, many books were low in Cohesion and Embedded Questions and were of low pedagogical quality. In Study 2, we tested thirty-eight 4- to 5-year-old children (55% female, 76% White) and their caregivers in the Southeastern United States. We assessed the influence of books' levels of Cohesion and Embedded Questions and of caregivers' Elaborative extratextual talk during shared book reading on children's science learning. Children learned more from books high in Cohesion, irrespective of levels of Embedded Questions and caregivers' Elaborative Talk. Additionally, children learned more from books high in Embedded Questions when caregivers used more Elaborative Talk. This research highlights the importance that books' textual features and social interactions during shared book reading have in promoting early science learning.

Family-Level Antecedents of Children's Patterns of Reactivity to Interparental Conflict: Testing the Reformulation of Emotional Security Theory	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Public Significance Statement This study suggests that there are distinct profiles of family functioning (i.e., interparental and parent-child qualities) that precede changes in children's patterns of behavioral reactivity to conflict between their parents. Because children's patterns of reactivity to conflict predict their mental health outcomes, understanding the family antecedents may help advance clinical targets and tools designed to promote children's coping and adjustment. Guided by emotional security theory, this study examined the family-level antecedents of children's reaction patterns to interparental conflict in a sample of 243 preschool children (M age = 4.60 years; 48% Black; 16% Latinx; 56% girls) and their parents in the Northeastern United States. Behavioral observations of children's responses to interparental conflict over two annual measurement occasions assessed their tendencies to exhibit four patterns of defending against threat: secure (i.e., efficiently address direct threats), mobilizing (i.e., high reactivity to potential threat and social opportunities), dominant (i.e., directly defeat threat), and demobilizing (i.e., reduce salience as a target of hostility). Latent profile analyses of interparental, coparental, and parent characteristics derived from multiple methods at the first wave yielded four profiles corresponding with harmonious, enmeshed, compensatory, and detouring patterns of family-level functioning. Additional analyses revealed that children in harmonious and compensatory family profiles exhibited more secure patterns of reactivity over a 1-year period than children in the enmeshed family profile. In contrast, subsequent mobilizing reactivity was most pronounced for children in the enmeshed family profile. Finally, children in the detouring profile exhibited substantially higher levels of demobilizing reactivity to interparental conflict. Results are discussed in the context of how they inform and refine emotional security theory.

This study shows that parental warmth fosters adolescents' resilience to handle social and emotional problems which is an important factor contributing to adolescent mental health. Parent-adolescent interactions can be very loving, although both parties might not always agree. The level of and discrepancy between ratings on parenting style are indicators for functioning within the family, affecting adolescents' psychological adjustment. This 4-year multiinformant study focuses on emotional warmth in parenting as a precursor for changes in adolescents' psychological adjustment. Altogether, 1,817 German adolescents and their parents report on the quality of their parental warmth, and the former additionally rates their emotional and social problems. Combining the latent true intraindividual change (TIC) and latent congruence (LCM) models, the results indicated that a higher level of jointly perceived parental warmth is linked to more positive adjustment for adolescents, whereas a discrepant rating in terms of a parental overreporting is associated with a lower adjustment. The meaning of shared and discrepant mother-adolescent and father-adolescent ratings for adolescents' psychological adjustment during late childhood and early adolescence is discussed.

Triangulating on Developmental Models With a Combination of Experimental and Nonexperimental Estimates	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Public Significance Statement When analyzing data from experiments with longer term follow-up assessments, sometimes researchers publish experimental impacts and longitudinal associations in separate articles. However, we argue that more can be learned from analyses that attempt to compare and contrast these experimental and nonexperimental estimates than from separate analyses that do not treat the experimental and nonexperimental analyses as potentially mutually informative. Plausible competing developmental models show similar or identical structural equation modeling model fit indices, despite making very different causal predictions. One way to help address this problem is incorporating outside information into selecting among models. This study attempted to select among developmental models of children's early mathematical skills by incorporating information about the extent to which models forecast the longitudinal pattern of causal impacts of early math interventions. We tested for the usefulness and validity of the approach by applying it to data from three randomized controlled trials of early math interventions with longitudinal follow-up assessments in the United States (Ns = 1,375, 591, 744; baseline age 4.3, 6.5, 4.4; 17%-69% Black). We found that, across data sets, (a) some models consistently outperformed other models at forecasting later experimental impacts, (b) traditional statistical fit indices were not strongly related to causal fit as indexed by models' accuracy at forecasting later experimental impacts, and (c) models showed consistent patterns of similarity and discrepancy between statistical fit and models' effectiveness at forecasting experimental impacts. We highlight the importance of triangulation and call for more comparisons of experimental and nonexperimental estimates for choosing among developmental models.

J	Deneault, AA; Hammond, S; Madigan, S				Deneault, Audrey-Ann; Hammond, Stuart, I; Madigan, Sheri			A Meta-Analysis of Child-Parent Attachment in Early Childhood and Prosociality	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Public Significance Statement The nature by which we interact with one another-namely how we help and show kindness to others-is critical for a functional and prosperous society. This study examined child-parent attachment as a potential source of influence for the development of prosociality. Across 41 studies and over 4,000 children, we identified that when children form a secure attachment relationship to their mothers and fathers, they are more likely to behave prosocially toward others. Although numerous individual studies have attempted to link child-parent attachment and prosociality, a systematic picture of that relationship requires a meta-analytic approach that considers different dimensions of prosociality and potential moderators. The current meta-analysis examined 41 studies drawn primarily from North America and Europe and published between 1978 to 2020. Child age ranged from 12 to 53 months at the assessment of child-parent attachment and 12 to 108 months at the assessment of prosociality. Across 35 studies (100 effect sizes, N = 4,611), child-mother attachment security and child prosociality were significantly associated (r = .19, 95% CI [.14, .23]). No moderators were identified. Exploratory estimates were also derived for subtypes of child-mother attachment insecurity. Across six studies (eight effect sizes, N = 402), child-father attachment security was significantly associated with prosociality (r = .11, 95% CI [.02, .23]). The magnitude of effect sizes did not differ based on parent gender. The discussion considers areas of growth for attachment and prosociality research.

J	Kurz, EM; Zinke, K; Born, J				Kurz, Eva-Maria; Zinke, Katharina; Born, Jan			Sleep Electroencephalogram (EEG) Oscillations and Associated Memory Processing During Childhood and Early Adolescence	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The architecture of sleep undergoes distinct changes during childhood and early adolescence. Slow wave sleep is involved in memory processing and may support active consolidation of newly encoded representations to support the formation of abstracted "gist" memories. Here, we examined sleep and overnight memory formation in German school children (n = 33) between 7 and 15 years of age, after the encoding phase of a verbal Deese-Roediger-McDermott (DRM) task. Effects of age were analyzed on sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) signatures of memory processing during nonrapid eye movement (NonREM) sleep, and the overnight formation of veridical and gist-based memories. Increasing age decreases time spent in slow wave sleep, and slow wave activity, whereas density and amplitude of fast sleep spindles in NonREM sleep were increased. Moreover, fast spindles were more consistently and more closely coupled to the upstate of the slow oscillation in the older children. Also, veridical and gist-based recall of words after sleep increased with age. Notably, a closer slow oscillation upstate-fast spindle coupling predicted veridical recall of words, and this relationship was found independent of age. Memory performance in the sleeping children did not differ from that of an age-matched control group (n = 32) tested over a daytime wake retention interval, with adolescents even showing superior veridical recall after wake. Our findings suggest that slow oscillation-spindle coupling as a mechanism of sleep-dependent memory formation becomes increasingly relevant during childhood and early adolescence. However, wake-associated mechanisms similarly effective in forming medium-term memory exist in this age as well. Public Significance Statement The recall of veridical and gist-based memories increases with age in children between 7 to 15 years of age. Whereas sleep compared with wakefulness did not generally alter memory performance, consolidation of veridical memory was connected to a more precise coupling of spindles to slow oscillations, two cardinal nonrapid eye movement sleep oscillations.

Maternal Postnatal Depressive Symptoms and Offspring Emotional and Behavioral Development at Age 7 Years in a UK Birth Cohort: The Role of Paternal Involvement	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Public Significance Statement The present study suggests that adverse effects of maternal postnatal depression on child development are not explained by various child-focused and mother-influenced dimensions of paternal involvement. Only father-child conflict emerged as a risk factor for adverse child development while also explaining the association between maternal postnatal depression and child development. If effects found causal, interventions that reduce father-child conflict may improve developmental outcomes of children of mothers with postnatal depression. There is considerable variability in developmental outcomes of children whose mothers experience depression. Few longitudinal studies have examined contributions of paternal involvement in the association between maternal postnatal depression (PND) and offspring development. We examined pathways from maternal PND at 8 weeks (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; total score) to offspring emotional and behavioral development at 7 years (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; total score) through behavioral, affective, and cognitive dimensions of paternal involvement in a U.K.-based birth cohort (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children; n = 3,434). Analyses were adjusted for baseline confounders and paternal PND (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; total score) as an intermediate confounder. Maternal PND was strongly associated with offspring development, but this association was not mediated by the combination of all indirect pathways through various dimensions of paternal involvement. Only father-child conflict emerged as a risk factor for adverse offspring development and as a mediator in the association between maternal PND and offspring development (albeit the effect size was small). If found causal, interventions that reduce father-child conflict may reduce the risk of adverse development in offspring of mothers with PND.

A New Perspective on the Role of Physical Salience in Visual Search: Graded Effect of Salience on Infants' Attention	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Public Significance Statement This study shows that how infants focus their attention is influenced by several different factors, including the infants' age and the characteristics of images (such as color and brightness). These results help us understand how infants process visual information. We tested 6- and 8-month-old White and non-White infants (N = 53 total, 28 girls) from Northern California in a visual search task to determine whether a unique item in an otherwise homogeneous display (a singleton) attracts attention because it is a unique singleton and "pops out" in a categorical manner, or whether attention instead varies in a graded manner on the basis of quantitative differences in physical salience. Infants viewed arrays of four or six items; one item was a singleton and the other items were identical distractors (e.g., a single cookie and three identical toy cars). At both ages, infants looked to the singletons first more often, were faster to look at singletons, and looked longer at singletons. However, when a computational model was used to quantify the relative salience of the singleton in each display-which varied widely among the different singleton-distractor combinations-we found a strong, graded effect of physical salience on attention and no evidence that singleton status per se influenced attention. In addition, consistent with other research on attention in infancy, the effect of salience was stronger for 6-month-old infants than for 8-month-old infants. Taken together, these results show that attention-getting and attention-holding in infancy vary continuously with quantitative variations in physical salience rather than depending in a categorical manner on whether an item is unique.

A sample of 128 mostly White middle-class families (68 girls) living in Montreal, Canada was assessed for paternal mind-mindedness when children were 18 months old, child language at age 2, theory of mind and effortful control at age 4, cognitive school readiness in kindergarten, and finally, achievement in math and reading in first grade. Controlling for maternal mind-mindedness assessed at age 12 months, the results showed prospective associations from paternal mind-mindedness to both math and reading achievement, mediated by theory of mind, effortful control, and school readiness in sequence. Results suggest that paternal mind-mindedness may support child academic outcomes by promoting the acquisition of intermediate skills during preschool years. Public Significance Statement After decades of research on mother-child relationships, developmental research is now paying increased attention to the importance of father-child relationships. This report is the first to show that fathers' inclination to comment on their toddler's mental states during play can initiate a cascade of skill acquisition in preschool years that has bearing for children's subsequent academic outcomes.

J	Wang, JJ				Wang, Jinjing (Jenny)			Does Virtual Counting Count for Babies? Evidence From an Online Looking Time Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Infants who receive better counting input at home tend to become toddlers with better number knowledge in preschool. However, for many children, in-person counting experience is not always available, despite educational media becoming increasingly prevalent. Might virtual counting experience benefit the young mind? Using a novel online looking time paradigm, a cross-sectional sample of 14- to 19-month-old infants' (United States; N = 81; 35 females; 64% White; within-subject design) ability to keep track of objects presented on screen was measured. We found that infants were significantly more likely to detect a change in numerical quantity after watching the objects being pointed at and counted by an animated hand compared with when there was no counting. These findings provide initial evidence for numerical cognitive benefits from counting video relative to a no counting baseline before the second birthday.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				APR	2023	59	4					669	675		10.1037/dev0001478	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001478		NOV 2022						36342439					WOS:000878772400001
J	Foley, S; Devine, RT; Hughes, C				Foley, Sarah; Devine, Rory T.; Hughes, Claire			Mind-Mindedness in New Mothers and Fathers: Stability and Discontinuity From Pregnancy to Toddlerhood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examined the development of caregiver mind-mindedness-defined as the propensity to see one's child as an agent with an independent mind-across the first 1,000 days of life. At four time-points (i.e., third trimester of pregnancy, 4, 14, and 24 months postpartum), 384 first-time mothers (M-age = 32.55, SD = 3.63 years) and fathers (M-age = 33.96, SD = 4.40 years) gave 5-minute speech samples about their infant that were coded for mind-mindedness (Meins & Fernyhough, 2015). Reflecting the local population, the 192 heterosexual couples were highly educated (84.6% of mothers, 77.1% of fathers had a degree) and ethnically homogenous (92.7% of mothers, 94.8% of fathers identified as White British). Results showed significant variability in mind mindedness within both expectant mothers and expectant fathers, with no mean group difference. Auto-regressive models demonstrated modest positive associations between prenatal and postnatal mind-mindedness. Latent change score models showed gains in mean mind-mindedness over time that, on average, were stronger for mothers than for fathers. For fathers, gains in mind-mindedness were positively associated with having an infant daughter and infant surgency. For mothers, higher socioeconomic status and more equal childcare were associated with greater gains in mind-mindedness across toddlerhood. Within-couple associations were evident for changes in mind-mindedness, but not for initial (prenatal) scores. We apply the relational account of mind-mindedness to frame our discussion of these findings that, by highlighting both developmental stability and change in mind-mindedness, suggest fruitful avenues for future research.

Rich and Sparse Figurative Information in Children's Memory for Colorful Places	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The relation between perceptual and conceptual knowledge is a longstanding research question in developmental psychology. Here we tested children's dependence on figurative information with a reaction time/accuracy task. A sample of 151 children from 5 to 10 years were assessed from two multicultural and multiracial schools in the London (UK) boroughs City of London and Harrow. A quarter of children in both schools were eligible for free school meals (national average 18.5%). The same 3 x 3 grid with nine individually colored places and a uniform black star as placeholder was tested in three different retrieval conditions: (a) same array as during presentation, (b) one place at a time with placeholder, and (c) one place at a time without placeholder. In a (d) control condition, individual shapes were of the same color as the colorful places. Bayes Factor analyses showed a more unified response toward figurative placeholders in 5- to 6-year-olds. Independently of age, colorful places without a placeholder were hardest to remember. Places were better remembered when a placeholder was added and still better when the spatial context of the entire array was available. Yet unique shapes with distinctive contours and colors as placeholders optimized place memory the most. While place memory accuracy increased with age, reaction times did not become faster. Instead, latencies were longer, the more visual information was available in the retrieval array. A larger perceptual effect was caused by the dynamic where-delay interference task, the sparser the amount of visual information in the retrieval array. Public Significance Statement This study reversed the usual set up of asking children to remember where objects were located. Instead, each color of a grid had an individual color. Results revealed that when 5- to 10-year-old children were tested for locations, they needed as much visual information of the grid as possible in order to accurately identify a place. The less visual information they were given, the more interference was possible. Still, an individual colorful shape's place was remembered best. With regards to response times, the more visual information they were given, the longer they needed to make a decision, independently of their age. The youngest children did not make a difference in their response times whether a colorful shape or a black star was a placeholder showing they opted for figures.

This study examined its emergence and how it might develop in tandem with a known predictor namely temperamental shyness for toddlers' fear of strangers in 168 Chinese toddlers. Measurable individual differences in such attention bias to fearful faces were found and remained stable from age 12 to 18 months. When shown photos of paired happy versus fearful or happy versus angry faces, toddlers initially gazed more and had longer initial fixation and total fixation at fearful faces compared with happy faces consistently. However, they initially gazed more at happy faces compared with angry faces consistently and had a longer total fixation at angry faces only at 18 months. Stranger anxiety at 12 months predicted attention bias to fearful faces at 18 months. Temperamentally shyer 12-month-olds went on to show stronger attention bias to fearful faces at 18 months, and their fear of strangers also increased more from 12 to 18 months. Together with prior research suggesting attention bias to angry or fearful faces foretelling social anxiety, the present findings point to likely positive feedback loops among attention bias to fearful faces, temperamental shyness, and stranger anxiety in early childhood. Public Significance Statement This study revealed that early shyness and stranger anxiety predispose toddlers to develop attention bias to threat-related negative emotions. Such attention bias can lead children to overestimate dangers in social situations and become more socially anxious. New knowledge of these developmental trajectories can inform how better to diagnose and intervene in early social anxiety.

It not only provides an example for future studies to investigate the relation between computational skills and other principles, but also encourages educators to implement interventions on children's complement understanding. Understanding of the complement principle has been proposed as closely related to computational skills, but few studies have investigated their interrelations. The present longitudinal study attempted to clarify the picture by examining their potential cross-lagged relation. Fourth graders (n = 221) in Hong Kong received 3 cognitive assessments at intervals of 6 months, consisting of multiple measures of complement understanding, a nonverbal intelligence test, and a computational skills measure. A random intercept cross-lagged panel model revealed that complement understanding significantly predicted future computational skills, but the reciprocal prediction was nonsignificant. The findings provide empirical evidence supporting the close relation between complement understanding and computational skills and call for future endeavors to examine the interrelations between computational skills and understanding of other arithmetic principles.

Yet little research has considered how the school's socioeconomic context is associated with social adjustment. In a longitudinal sample of Australian 4- to 8-year-olds (N = 9369; 51% boys) we tested the association between school average socioeconomic status and social skills (parent and teacher reported). Models controlled for age 4 social adjustment and additional covariates. Results showed that children from more advantaged schools are more likely to have better prosocial behavior and fewer peer and conduct problems. An interaction between family and school average socioeconomic status (SES) suggested that this association was mainly present for children from lower SES backgrounds. Public Significance Statement Socioeconomic status (SES) predicts social skills. Social skills help children form positive relationships with each other and adults. The SES of a school can influence social skills. In many countries and states, the SES level of a school a child goes to depends on the wealth of their parents. High SES schools usually have more resources. We found that children that go to high SES schools have improved social skills. This may be because they can access more resources. High SES schools appeared to be most beneficial for children from low SES backgrounds. The way society determines what child will go to what school may influence the social skills that children develop.

The current study does not support this for socioemotional, verbal, and numerical outcomes when considering parental closeness and conflict among teenagers who were born very preterm, late preterm, and full-term. Young children born preterm may be more affected by environmental influences than their full-term peers. Few studies have investigated whether such effects exist for older children and young adolescents. With participants aged 9 and 13 years, we examine whether children born preterm could be differentially affected by the quality of their relationship with their mothers and fathers. We used the Growing Up in Ireland dataset: a longitudinal sample of 8,568 children in Ireland (51.4% female, 48.6% male) and their parents. We found that parent-child conflict was consistently associated with poorer verbal, numerical, and socioemotional outcomes; in some instances, parent-child closeness was associated with better outcomes. Being born very preterm was consistently associated with negative outcomes. We found support for a diathesis-stress model of preterm birth in just one instance: children born very preterm displayed a stronger relationship between maternal conflict and increased socioemotional difficulties.

J	Fagan, J; Cabrera, N; Ghosh, R				Fagan, Jay; Cabrera, Natasha; Ghosh, Rachel			Explaining the Long Reach of Prenatal Behaviors and Attitudes in Unmarried Men at Birth on Father Engagement in Early and Middle Childhood and Adolescence	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Public Significance Statement This study found that fathers who are unmarried at the time of their child's birth are more engaged and have closer relationships with their children when they provide tangible support to the mother during the pregnancy, are present at the birth, establish paternity establishment, and to a lesser extent have positive attitudes about the pregnancy and developing a commitment to fatherhood. Researchers, practitioners, and policymakers should take advantage of this period and direct some of their resources to facilitate and strengthen prospective fathers' early relationships with their partners and children. The current study examined three research questions: (a) Are unmarried at birth fathers' prenatal and birth-related behavioral, attitudinal, and identity adjustments directly related to father engagement in child-related activities during early childhood and father-child closeness in middle childhood and adolescence? (b) Do father engagement in child-related activities during early childhood, coresidence, and coparenting at age 5 mediate the association between unmarried fathers' prenatal and birth-related variables and father-child relationship in middle childhood and adolescence? (c) Do father-child closeness, coresidence, and coparenting in middle childhood mediate the association between fathers' prenatal and birth-related variables and father-child relationship during adolescence? Using a subsample of Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing data (N = 2,647), we found support for our hypotheses that fathers' prenatal and birth-related variables significantly predicted father-child engagement during early childhood and father-child closeness during middle childhood and adolescence, although not all prenatal and birth-related variables are related to outcomes during each stage of childhood development. Father involvement and coparenting cooperation significantly mediated the associations among fathers' prenatal and birth-related variables and father-child closeness at ages 9 and 15. Our findings indicate that researchers, practitioners, and policymakers should take advantage of the prenatal period and direct resources to facilitate and strengthen prospective unmarried fathers' early relationships with their partners and children.

J	Blomquist, C; McMurray, B				Blomquist, Christina; McMurray, Bob			The Development of Lexical Inhibition in Spoken Word Recognition	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Public Significance Statement This study suggests that inhibition between words during spoken word recognition shows development across the school years, with younger children showing less reliable engagement of lexical inhibition while older children and adults show consistent engagement. Thus, development of lexical inhibition may help to explain the increases in efficiency of spoken word recognition that continue through adolescence. As a spoken word unfolds over time, similar sounding words (cap and cat) compete until one word "wins". Lexical competition becomes more efficient from infancy through adolescence. We examined one potential mechanism underlying this development: lexical inhibition, by which activated candidates suppress competitors. In Experiment 1, younger (7-8 years) and older (12-13 years) children heard words (cap) in which the onset was manipulated to briefly boost competition from a cohort competitor (cat). This was compared to a condition with a nonword (cack) onset that would not inhibit the target. Words were presented in a visual world task during which eye movements were recorded. Both groups showed less looking to the target when perceiving the competitor-splice relative to the nonword-splice, showing engagement of lexical inhibition. Exploratory analyses of linguistic adaptation across the experiment revealed that older children demonstrated consistent lexical inhibition across the experiment and younger children did not, initially showing no effect in the first half of trials and then a robust effect in the latter half. In Experiment 2, adults also displayed consistent lexical inhibition in the same task. These findings suggest that younger children do not consistently engage lexical inhibition in typical listening but can quickly bring it online in response to certain linguistic experiences. Computational modeling showed that age-related differences are best explained by increased engagement of inhibition rather than growth in activation. These findings suggest that continued development of lexical inhibition in later childhood may underlie increases in efficiency of spoken word recognition.

A Longitudinal Analysis of the Social Information in Infants' Naturalistic Visual Experience Using Automated Detections	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The faces and hands of caregivers and other social partners offer a rich source of social and causal information that is likely critical for infants' cognitive and linguistic development. Previous work using manual annotation strategies and cross-sectional data has found systematic changes in the proportion of faces and hands in the egocentric perspective of young infants. Here, we validated the use of a modern convolutional neural network (OpenPose) for the detection of faces and hands in naturalistic egocentric videos. We then applied this model to a longitudinal collection of more than 1,700 head-mounted camera videos from three children ages 6 to 32 months. Using these detections, we confirm and extend prior results from cross-sectional studies. First, we found a moderate decrease in the proportion of faces in children's view across age and a higher proportion of hands in view than previously reported. Second, we found variability in the proportion of faces and hands viewed by different children in different locations (e.g., living room vs. kitchen), suggesting that individual activity contexts may shape the social information that infants experience. Third, we found evidence that children may see closer, larger views of people, hands, and faces earlier in development. These longitudinal analyses provide an additional perspective on the changes in the social information in view across the first few years of life and suggest that pose detection models can successfully be applied to naturalistic egocentric video data sets to extract descriptives about infants' changing social environment.

Associations Between Preschool Cognitive and Behavioral Skills and College Enrollment: Evidence From the Chicago School Readiness Project	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The current article examines associations between preschool cognitive and behavioral skills and indicators of college enrollment in a sample (n = 379) of primarily Black and Hispanic youth growing up in low-income areas of Chicago. Although we found that most early cognitive and behavioral skills were only weakly or moderately related to later college enrollment, a rating of preschool attention and impulsivity control was a relatively strong predictor. Across most models tested, attention and impulsivity control, executive functioning, and effortful control produced predicted probabilities that were similar in magnitude, or larger, than the effects produced by early math and literacy. Then was no indication that early behavioral difficulties were substantive predictors of college enrollment. These descriptive findings suggest that in a low-income sample of children, some early cognitive capabilities related to attention and El' predict longer term college enrollment. We discuss implications for developmental theory and suggest that caution should be applied when projecting likely effects of early skill-focused interventions.

Family Dynamics and Adjustment Across Latino/a Students' Transition to College: Disentangling Within- and Between-Person Reciprocal Associations	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Latino/a adolescents are increasingly represented in higher education. Whereas previous work suggests that positive aspects of the family can promote adjustment during the college transition, less is known regarding the longitudinal, reciprocal nature of these associations. The current study examined changes in parenting, family dynamics, and adjustment across the transition from high school to college among 207 Latino/a young adults (M-age = 18.10; 65.0% female identifying) in the Southwestern United States and investigated within- and between-person reciprocal relations using standard and random-intercept cross-lagged panel models. Participants self-reported on parental support. parental monitoring, family communication, depressive symptoms, and alcohol use during their senior year of high school (Time 1; spring/summer 2017), first semester of college (Time 2; fall 2017), and second semester of college (Time 3; spring/summer 2018). Parental support, family communication, depressive symptoms, and alcohol use increased across the initial transition from high school to college, whereas parental monitoring decreased across time. Reciprocal effects were largely between-person driven. Family communication in high school was concurrently and prospectively related to fewer depressive symptoms. Higher parental monitoring during the first semester of college was related to less alcohol use within and across semesters. In addition, students who experienced within-person increases in depressive symptoms during the first semester of college perceived less parental support than usual the next semester. Study findings point to the importance of developmental timing and further highlight the role that family plays during Latino/a students' transition to college. Implications for family-based prevention efforts are discussed.

Prospective Associations Between Pandemic-Related Adversity, Harsh Parenting, and the Development of Prosociality Across Middle to Late Childhood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Parenting behaviors and children's prosociality (i.e., voluntary behaviors intended to benefit others) are linked across development. Contextual risk and environmental stressors may undermine parenting behaviors known to promote children's prosocial behavior. The COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique context in which to examine how stress and contextual risk disrupt parenting practices and the development of children's prosociality over time. To explore the associations between pandemic-related adversity, parenting practices, and child prosocial behavior, we used survey data from 303 families (child M-age = 6.43; 51.4% female, 48.6% male; 65.7% White) who participated in a three-wave longitudinal study during the first year of the pandemic. Families were recruited from two northeastern cities in the United States. Growth mixture modeling identified two groups of parents who varied in their experience of pandemic-related adversity. The high-adversity group reported significantly more symptoms of depression and anxiety. parental burnout, and pandemic-related worries than the low-adversity group. At baseline. parents in the high-adversity group reported harsher parenting and perceived less prosocial behavior in their children. Across the full sample, there were no significant changes in harsh parenting and parental perceptions of child's prosociality across the first year of the pandemic. However, within the high-adversity group, increases in harsh parenting were related to reductions in children's prosociality over time. Results are interpreted in the context of family systems theory and contribute to our understanding of the links between parenting and children's prosociality and patterns of risk and resilience in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

J	Zhao, X; Yang, X				Zhao, Xin; Yang, Xin			She Succeeded Despite Lack of Ability or Resources: Children's Consideration of Constraint in Beliefs and Reasoning About Academic Achievement	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												High achievers vary in terms of the constraints and difficulties they encounter on the road to success. The present study investigates whether and how children consider the constraints one overcomes in their beliefs and reasoning about academic achievement. Four- to nine-year-olds (N = 98, 57 girls, 41 boys) and their parents (N = 92, 80 females, 12 males) of Han ethnicity in China were asked whether they believed someone could choose to overcome internal constraints (i.e., lack of ability) or external constraints (i.e., lack of educational resources) to achieve academic success. They were then presented with two story characters who both achieved high exam scores. One of the characters had to overcome internal or external constraints to achieve a high exam score, whereas the other did not face these constraints. Participants were asked about their inferences (i.e., the level of effort) and comparative evaluations of the two characters. Clear developmental changes were found: With age, children increasingly believed that one could choose to overcome constraints to achieve academic success and inferred that the character who overcame these constraints worked harder than the character who did not experience such constraints. Children also increasingly evaluated the character who overcame constraints more favorably than the character who did not experience such constraints. These findings advance research in children's cognitive understanding of achievements and abilities by revealing that, as children get older, they gradually recognize the possibility and positivity of overcoming constraints to achieve success.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				MAR	2023	59	3					594	608		10.1037/dev0001465	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001465		OCT 2022						36201816					WOS:000864339700001

DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Dialogic reading (DR) is an interactive reading approach that enhances the language development of children. This study aims to extend DR to the shared reading context involving children with attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and their older siblings and to examine the effects of DR with parents/siblings on the language development of Chinese children with ADHD. This study included 850 Chinese kindergarteners with ADHD and their parents/older siblings. These children were pretested on their Chinese receptive vocabulary, expressive vocabulary, character reading, listening comprehension, and reading interest and were randomly assigned to four groups. namely, dialogic reading with parents (PR-DR), dialogic reading with siblings (SR-DR). parent reading control (PR-C), and sibling reading control (SR-C). After a 12-week intervention period, they were posttested on the same measures. Results show that both DR with parents and siblings effectively enhanced language skills and reading interest in children with ADHD. In addition. those children who read with their older siblings demonstrated greater improvements in their expressive vocabulary. character reading skills, morphological awareness, phonological awareness. and reading interest yet achieved a smaller growth in their listening comprehension compared with those who read with their parents.

Recent research in young adults has shown that semantically related associates can be falsely remembered as studied items in working memory (WM) tasks for lists of only a few items when a short 4-second interval was given between study and test. The present study reported two experiments yielding similar effects in 4- (n = 32 and 33, 18 and 14 females, respectively) and 8-year-old children (n = 33 and 34, respectively, 19 females in both). Short lists of semantically related items specifically tailored for young children were retained over a brief interval. Whether or not the interval was filled with a concurrent task that impeded or not WM maintenance, younger children were as prone to falsely recognize related distractors as their older counterparts in an immediate recognition test, and also in a delayed test. In addition, using the conjoint recognition model of the fuzzy-trace theory, we demonstrated that the retrieval of gist traces of the list themes was responsible for the occurrence of short-term false memories in 4- and 8-year-old children. Gist memory also underpinned the occurrence of false recognition in the delayed test. These findings suggest that young children are as likely to make gist-based false memories as older children in working memory tasks.

Longitudinal Change in Daily Stress Across 20 Years of Adulthood: Results From the National Study of Daily Experiences	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examined age-related patterns in exposure and affective reactivity to daily stressors across a 20-year time span among adults who were between 22 and 77 years old at their baseline interview. Longitudinal data from the National Study of Daily Experiences (NSDE) consisted of three bursts of eight consecutive nightly interviews of stress and affect. Analyses made use of all available data from a U.S. National sample of respondents who participated in any of the three NSDE bursts (N = 2,845; number of daily assessments = 33,688). Findings revealed increasing age-related benefits. Younger adults (<30 years) reported the highest levels of stressor exposure and reactivity, but their stress profile improved with age. Over time, adults averaged an 11% reduction in the occurrence of stressor days, and the younger adults exhibited an even steeper decline (a 47% reduction) in their levels of stressor reactivity. For people in midlife and old age, stressor occurrence continued to decrease over time, yet among adults aged 54 years or older at baseline, stress reactivity remained stable across time.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				MAR	2023	59	3					515	523		10.1037/dev0001469	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001469		SEP 2022						36174182					WOS:000860912500001

Young Children Calibrate Effort Based on the Trajectory of Their Performance	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Public Significance Statement How do children decide which challenges are worth pursuing? We show that young children pay attention to their rate of past performance: 4- to 6-year-olds are more likely to persist with a challenge if their past performance increases over time versus stays constant, even when their final score is the same. Our results suggest that adults can help foster young children's persistence by guiding children toward achievable tasks just outside their comfort zone and highlighting their growth. Learning requires effort, but children cannot try hard at everything. Here, we evaluated whether children use their improvement over time to decide whether to stick with a challenge. To eliminate the effect of individual differences in ability or prior knowledge, we created a novel paradigm that allowed us to surreptitiously control children's performance. Across three preregistered experiments (N = 319, ages 4 to 6 in the United States), we found that children who were given evidence that their performance was improving were more likely to persist on a challenging task than children who were given evidence that their performance was constant, even when final performance was matched. This effect was robust to differing reward contingencies, across in-person and online testing contexts, and was driven by the demotivating effect of constant performance. Our results suggest that young children will be more persistent if they are guided away from too-difficult tasks and toward opportunities that enable steady growth.

Associations Between Error-Related Negativity and Childhood Anxiety Risk Differ Based on Socioeconomic Status	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Children from lower socioeconomic status (SES) families are at increased risk for anxiety problems, though knowledge of the pathways by which SES predicts children's anxiety outcomes remains scant. Limited work suggests SES as a moderator of links between early development and anxiety outcomes but has not used a longitudinal framework or a multimethod approach. In this preregistered study, SES was tested as a simultaneous moderator of putatively biologically (error-related negativity [ERN]) and contextually (authoritarian parenting) based pathways of anxiety risk from ages 3 (M-age = 3.59), 4 (M-age = 4.57), and 5 (M-age = 5.52) [N = 121; 59% female]. Families were largely White and Non-Hispanic and reported a broad range of income (less than $15,000 to $90,001 or greater) from 2014 to 2017. We hypothesized that putatively biological pathways would be the strongest predictors of child outcomes at high SES and that putatively contextual pathways would be the strongest predictors of child outcomes at low SES. Consistent with expectations, smaller ERN across ages 3 and 4 was associated with greater anxious behaviors at age 5, but only at high SES. SES did not moderate parenting-based pathways of risk. Results are partially consistent with previous work suggesting that putatively biological pathways are more robust predictors of child outcomes at high SES than at low SES.

This study applies network analysis to explore the interrelations between maternal and paternal coparenting, parenting styles, and parental involvement in families with adolescents in early (10-12 years), middle (13-15 years), and late (16-18 years) stages. Network analysis was used to identify central nodes (i.e., central parenting components) and central mechanisms (i.e., relations between central parenting variables) underlying the parenting network, providing a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of parenting. This study included 4,852 adolescents aged from 10 to 18 (M-age = 13.80, SD = 2.38, 51.5% females) in two-parent families across different regions of China. The results indicated that both maternal and paternal coparenting integrity and warm parenting style served as important bridges to connect the whole network; their integrity and emotional involvement were closely linked to other parenting variables. Also, the intrapersonal and interpersonal effects between mothering and fathering as well as adolescent developmental differences were found. If it is assumed that the parenting network is causal, the results suggest that supportive parenting should be considered the prime target for enhancing parenting systems. Adolescent developmental stages appear to be a vital factor influencing parenting intercorrelations, and interventions should be designed based on children's age groups. Public Significance Statement This study suggests that mothers' and fathers' coparenting integrity, warm parenting style, and emotional involvement are particularly important to the parenting system, which encourages interventions on supportive parenting to maximize the effectiveness and benefit the family system. Additionally, it highlights the complementary effects between mothers and fathers in the family, and the developmental characteristics of and differences in parenting early, middle, and late adolescents.

J	Martinez, KM; Holden, LR; Hart, SA; Taylor, J				Martinez, Kimberly M.; Holden, LaTasha R.; Hart, Sara A.; Taylor, Jeanette			Examining Mindset and Grit in Concurrent and Future Reading Comprehension: A Twin Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Noncognitive factors have gained attention in recent years as potential intervention targets for academic achievement improvement in students. Two notable facets, intelligence mindset and grit, have been of particular interest. Both have been shown to consistently improve educational outcomes, although little work has focused on reading ability. As such, we examined die relation between both grit and mindset on current, future, and change in reading comprehension ability in a twin sample. We used data from 422 twin pairs (171 monozygotic pairs, 251 dizygotic pairs) drawn from the Florida Twin Project on Reading, Behavior and Environment (Taylor et al., 2019). The racial composition of the sample included 1.00% American Indian or Alaska Native, 2.25% Asian, 13.25% Black or African American. 22.63% Hispanic, 1.00% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, 56.13% White. and 3.75% more than 1 race. The household income of the sample at time I was 16.15% below $2.5.000, 18.06% $25,000-49,999, 36.34% $50,000-99,999, and 29.45% $100,000 or more and closely align with the overall composition reported for the state of Florida (United States Census Bureau, 2021). Twins were on average 13 years old when the questionnaire and first reading ability measure were collected, and on average 15 years old when the second reading ability measure was collected. Weak and moderate positive correlations were found between both mindset and grit and with each reading ability score and neither were significantly related to change in reading ability. Twin modeling suggested little to no common genetic or environmental influences between mindset and grit to reading ability. In total, our results do not lend support to the notion of mindset or grit being a mechanism of change for reading ability.

Development of Dynamic Attention: Time-Based Visual Selection for Objects in Motion Between 6-12 Years of Age	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												By approximately 6 years of age, children can use time-based visual selection to ignore stationary stimuli, already in the visual field and prioritize the selection of newly arriving stimuli. This ability can be studied using preview search, a version of the visual search paradigm with an added temporal component, in which one set of distractors is presented (previewed) before a second set that contains the target item. Preview search is more efficient than if all items are presented simultaneously, suggesting that temporally "old" objects can be ignored (the preview benefit). In two experiments, we examined the developmental trajectory for time-based visual selection in a sample of 192 6-, 8-, and 12-year-old children (49% female, predominantly White), with adults as controls (75% female, predominantly White), in the United Kingdom. The results showed an absence of the ability to ignore previewed moving distractors in 6-year-olds and confirmed its presence from 8 years of age. However, full development of this ability, which includes maintaining inhibition of previewed items over extended periods, was only present from the age of 12. Individual differences in executive functions, namely inhibition, were associated with preview search efficiency in 6-year-olds and adults. Overall, the results suggest a developmental trajectory in the ability to ignore moving old objects that occurs in two stages and develops later than the ability to ignore previewed stationary objects. The results are discussed in terms of underlying inhibitory mechanisms, in addition to individual differences in the expression of this ability.

J	Symonds, JE; D'Urso, G; Schoon, I				Symonds, Jennifer E.; D'Urso, Giulio; Schoon, Ingrid			The Long-Term Benefits of Adolescent School Engagement for Adult Educational and Employment Outcomes	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Public Significance Statement Being more engaged in school in adolescence has long-term benefits for obtaining educational and occupational success in adulthood. The competencies that people use for engaging in school may be transferrable to academic achievement and doing well in employment. Engagement also works to channel resources from the environment to individuals-creating greater career opportunities in adulthood. School engagement in adolescence is often associated with better academic performance at school, but what are the longitudinal associations between school engagement and adult educational and employment status? The current study explored these longitudinal associations using data spanning 40-years of life, from the 1970 British Cohort Study. School engagement at age 16-years was used to predict highest educational level at age 34-years, and socioeconomic status and income at ages 34- and 46-years, controlling for childhood socioeconomic status, cognitive ability, gender, and ethnic minority status, collected at ages 5- or 10-years. The 13,135 individuals in the sample were born in 1970, were mainly White (96%), and were identified at age 5-years as being 48% female. Longitudinal structural equation models revealed that adolescent school engagement had a persistent, positive impact on adult educational and employment outcomes after individual differences were controlled for. The results are interpreted using the perspective that school engagement can channel resources which are important for later educational and occupational success.

Children's Dynamic Use of Face- and Behavior-Based Cues in an Economic Trust Game	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Who do children trust? We investigated the extent to which children use face-based versus behavior-based cues when deciding whom to trust in a multiturn economic trust game. Children's (N = 42; aged 8 to 10 years; 31 females; predominantly White) trust decisions were informed by an interaction between face-based and behavior-based cues to trustworthiness, similarly to those of adults (N = 41; aged 17 to 48 years; 23 females; predominantly White). Facial trustworthiness guided children's investment decisions initially, such that they invested highly with trustworthy-looking partners and less with untrustworthy-looking partners. However, by the end of the trust game, after children had experienced game partners' fair or unfair return behavior, they overcame this bias and instead used partners' previous behavior to guide their trust decisions. Using partners' return behavior to guide decisions was the most rational strategy, because partners' facial trustworthiness was not an accurate cue to their actual trustworthiness. This dynamic use of different cues to trustworthiness suggests sophisticated levels of social cognition in children, which may reflect the social importance of trust impressions.

How do children identify which properties of an individual are essentialized and which are not? Here, we examine whether formal explanations-that is, explanations that appeal to category membership (e.g., "That's ferocious because it's a tiger")-help children to identify which properties are essentialized. We investigated this question in two domains: animal kinds (Study 1) and social categories (specifically, gender; Studies 2 and 3). Across studies, we introduced children to novel behaviors and preferences of individuals using either a formal explanation or closely matched wording that did not express a formal explanation. To measure the extent to which children essentialized the novel properties, we assessed their inferences about the stability, innateness, and generalizability of these properties. In Study 1 (N = 104; 61 girls, 43 boys; predominantly White and multiracial children from high-income backgrounds), we found that formal explanations led 5- and 6-year-old children to view novel properties of individual animals as more stable across time. In Studies 2 and 3 (total N = 163; 84 girls, 79 boys; predominantly White, Asian, and multiracial children from high-income backgrounds), we found that formal explanations led 6-year-olds, but not 5-year-olds, to view novel properties of individual girls and boys as more stable across contexts. These studies highlight an important mechanism by which formal explanations guide conceptual development.

Differences in the Semantic Structure of the Speech Experienced by Late Talkers, Late Bloomers, and Typical Talkers	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The present study investigates the relation between language environment and language delay in 63 British-English speaking children (19 typical talkers (TT), 22 late talkers (LT), and 22 late bloomers (LB) aged 13 to 18 months. Families audio recorded daily routines and marked the new words their child produced over a period of 6 months. To investigate how language environments differed between talker types and how environments corresponded with children's developing lexicons, we evaluated contextual diversity-a word property that measures semantic richness-and network properties of language environments in tandem with developing vocabularies. The language environment experienced by the three talker types differed in their structural properties, with LT environments being least contextually diverse and least well-connected in relation to network properties. Notably, LBs' language environments were more like those of TTs. Network properties of language environments also correlate with the rate of vocabulary growth over the study period. By comparing differences between language environments and lexical network development, we also observe results consistent with contributions to lexical development from different learning strategies for expressive vocabularies and different environments for receptive vocabularies. We discuss the potential consequences that structural differences in parental speech might have on language development and the contribution of this work to the debate on quantity versus quality.

In our experiment, one hundred one 4- to 10-year-old children and 24 adults either passively observed or used a touchscreen interface to actively interact with objects in a dynamic physical microworld with the goal of inferring one of two latent physical properties: relative object masses or local forces of attraction and repulsion. We find an age improvement in judgments as well as an advantage for active over passive learning. With the help of Bayesian statistics and a computational modeling framework for the quantitative analysis of participants' actions, we show that children's and adults' actions are equally successful in targeting their goal-relevant uncertainty, but that adults and older children are better able to use this information to respond correctly. We further unpack children's and adults' experimental strategies qualitatively, finding adults more likely to use a "deconfounding" strategy to isolate properties of interest, potentially creating evidence less susceptible to cognitive and perceptual errors.

We provide an answer to this question by meta-analyzing sex differences in preference for prosocial over antisocial agents in a set of 53 samples of American and European infants and toddlers aged between 4 and 32 months (N = 1,094). Although the original studies were agnostic to sex differences, we were able to retrieve the original data sets and estimate the effect of infants' and toddlers' sex on sociomoral preferences. Employing both a standard frequentist and a Bayesian approach to meta-analysis, we found strong evidence supporting the absence of sex differences in sociomoral preferences among infants and toddlers. We discuss the relevance of this finding for theories and descriptions of the emergence and developmental trajectory of gender differences in morality. Public Significance Statement We found strong evidence that, within the first 3 years of life, males and females do not differ in their tendency to prefer prosocial agents over antisocial agents, a tendency that is considered by many to be a building block of adult moral cognition. The present meta-analysis gives evidence to evaluate theories and hypotheses about the development of gender differences in moral judgment.

The study was conducted in Bhutan (N = 105, M = 278 days, 52% males) but also draws from publicly available Swedish data (N = 113, M = 302 days, 49% males). We demonstrate that Bhutanese and Swedish infants' development follows the same trajectory. However, Bhutanese infants' gaze following were not related to maternal PPD, which the Swedish infants' were. The results support the notion that there are protecting factors built into the interdependent family model. Despite all the benefits of being raised in a modern welfare state, it seems like Swedish infants, to an extent, are more vulnerable to maternal mental health than Bhutanese infants.

Here we asked whether children would privilege ingroup members when teaching and, if so, whether this tendency would persist when transferring different kinds of information (conventional norms vs. moral norms). In Experiment 1 (N = 24), we first replicated ingroup preference based on minimal group membership with 5- and 6-year-old Turkish children. In Experiment 2 (N = 64), we examined whether children would consider group membership and the type of knowledge to be transferred in their teaching intentions. Children were introduced to two ignorant targets differing in their group membership and were asked to choose one or both of these targets to teach conventional or moral norms. Children were more likely to choose ingroup members for teaching conventional norms and both members when teaching moral norms. Further, this trend was particularly evident among girls. These results suggest that children make flexible teaching decisions considering the social attributes of the learners and raise interesting questions regarding the mechanisms underlying children's information transfer. Public Significance Statement Children consider various factors when choosing whom to learn from, although much less is known about children's selectivity when teaching others. We show that children intend to teach conventional norms selectively to ingroup members and moral norms to both ingroup and outgroup members. These results suggest that children make flexible teaching decisions taking both the nature of the information and the recipient's social attributes into account and provide further evidence for children's active role in cultural transmission.

J	Kim, M; Schachner, A				Kim, Minju; Schachner, Adena			The Origins of Dance: Characterizing the Development of Infants' Earliest Dance Behavior	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Dance is a universal human behavior and a crucial component of human musicality. When and how does the motivation and tendency to move to music develop? How does this behavior change as a process of maturation and learning? We characterize infants' earliest dance behavior, leveraging parents' extensive at-home observations of their children. Parents of infants aged 0-24 months (N = 278, 82.7% White, 84.5% in the United States, 46.0% of household incomes >=$100,000) were surveyed regarding their child's current and earliest dance behavior (movement by the child, during music, that the parent considered dance), motor development, and their own infant-directed dance. We found that dance begins early: 90% of infants produced recognizable dance by 12.8 months, and the age of onset was not solely a function of motor development. Infants who produced dance did so often, on average almost every day. We also found that dance shows qualitative developmental change over the first 2 years, rather than remaining stable. With motor development, age, and more time dancing, infants used a greater variety of movements in dance, and began to incorporate learned, imitated gestures (80% of infants by 17.9 months). 99.8% of parents reported dancing for or with their infants, raising questions about the role of infant-directed dance. These findings provide evidence that the motivation and tendency to move to music appears extremely early and that both learning and maturation lead to qualitative change in dance behavior during the first 2 years, informing broad questions about the origins of human musicality. Public Significance Statement Music and dance impact human well-being, social behavior, and health. We find that the motivation and tendency to move to music appears extremely early in life, and shows developmental change over the first 2 years. Movement to music appears to be a fundamental part of infants' behavioral repertoire, with implications for early cognitive, emotional, social, and motor development.

Longitudinal and Daily Associations Between Adolescent Self-Control and Digital Technology Use	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Public Significance Statement Concerns exist regarding how digital technology use relates to adolescents' self-control. Across two studies, we demonstrate that adolescents who report lower self-control also perceive greater technological impairment and report higher use. However, there is no evidence that experiencing poorer self-control than one's own average is linked to greater perceptions of digital technological impairment or use, either longitudinally or at the daily level. There is fear that adolescents have limited control over their digital technology use. The current research examines longitudinal (Study 1) and daily (Study 2) associations between U.S. adolescents' self-control and digital technological impairment and use. Using a large sample (N = 2,104; Wave 1: M-age = 12.36, 52% female, 57% economically disadvantaged, 48% racial minority), Study 1 tested how changes in adolescents' self-control and perceived technological impairment co-occur across time (between-person associations) and if self-control and perceived impairment are prospectively and bidirectionally associated with each other (within-person associations). There was evidence of between-person associations, in that poorer self-control and perceived technological impairment both increase over adolescence, and these increases are positively associated with each other. However, there was no evidence of prospective within-person associations. Using a subsample from Study 1 (N = 388), Study 2 found support for a between-person association for self-control and using digital technology for entertainment, in which adolescents who reported poorer self-control relative to their peers also engaged in greater digital technology use for entertainment. There was no robust support for within-person associations. These findings suggest that adolescents with poorer self-control may have established tendencies to experience greater technological impairment and use more digital technology for entertainment, but the lack of within-person associations indicate caution is needed for a cause-and-effect relation. Adolescents with existing poorer self-control may be more vulnerable to problematic digital technology use in a developmental period where digital technology is particularly rewarding, and intervention and prevention efforts should be geared toward these adolescents.

Orientation Effects Support Specialist Processing of Upright Unfamiliar Faces in Children and Adults	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												It is considerably harder to generalize identity across different pictures of unfamiliar faces, compared with familiar faces. This finding hints strongly at qualitatively distinct processing of unfamiliar face stimuli-for which we have less expertise. Yet, the extent to which face selective versus generic visual processes drive outcomes during this task has yet to be determined. To explore the relative contributions of each, we contrasted performance on a version of the popular Telling Faces Together unfamiliar face matching task, implemented in both upright and inverted orientations. Furthermore, we included different age groups (132 British children ages 6 to 11 years [69.7% White], plus 37 British White adults) to investigate how participants' experience with faces as a category influences their selective utilization of specialized processes for unfamiliar faces. Results revealed that unfamiliar face matching is highly orientation-selective. Accuracy was higher for upright compared with inverted faces from 6 years of age. which is consistent with selective utilization of specialized processes for upright versus inverted unfamiliar faces during this task. The effect of stimulus orientation did not interact significantly with age, and there was no graded increase in the magnitude of inversion effects observed across childhood. Still, a numerically larger inversion effect in adults compared to children provides a degree of support for developmental changes in these specialized face abilities with increasing age/experience. Differences in the pattern of errors across age groups are also consistent with a qualitative shift in unfamiliar face processing that occurs some time after 11 years of age.

J	Peets, K; Hodges, EV				Peets, Katlin; Hodges, Ernest Van Every			Longitudinal Associations Between Adolescents' Narcissism and Friendship Features Depend on Gender and Friends' Narcissism	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Youth with greater levels of narcissism face a wide array of difficulties in interactions with others. However, there exists a curious lack of research on their close relationships, such as friendships. In this study, we examined associations between narcissism and friendship features over time. Participants were 261 eighth and ninth graders (112 boys; M-age at Time1 = 14.34, SD = .68; 95.4% born in Finland) who completed measures of narcissism at Time 1 (fall of the school year), and friendship nominations as well as three different characteristics of friendship (positive friendship quality, corumination, and conflict) at Time 1 and Time 2 (spring of the school year). When we limited our analyses to participants who were in stable reciprocated friendships, then, for girls, narcissism was negatively associated with Time 2 positive friendship quality as well as corumination. For boys, narcissism was not significantly associated with Time 2 positive friendship quality nor corumination. In addition, higher levels of narcissism predicted greater Time 2 positive friendship quality when the friend scored relatively low on narcissism. Our discussion focuses on the putative mechanisms that might account for differences in the dynamics of friendships of boys and girls with greater narcissistic traits, and why youth with greater narcissism levels might perceive their friendships as having more positive features when their friend is dissimilar.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				JAN	2023	59	1					43	56		10.1037/dev0001452	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001452		SEP 2022						36074586					WOS:000850634700001

Their Relative Importance in Predicting Adolescent Aggressive Behavior: A Longitudinal Comparison	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												To understand whose parenting (mothers vs. fathers) and which type of parenting (warmth vs. hostility) is more important in predicting adolescent aggression, this study applied dominance analysis to evaluate the relative importance of four different parenting dimensions (maternal hostility, paternal hostility, maternal warmth, and paternal warmth). Four waves of adolescent-reported longitudinal data from the PROSPER project (N = 626, 52% adolescent girls, 89% White rural, age 12 to 15) were used to investigate longitudinal change in the relative importance of these dimensions over time. Findings reveal that at most ages, maternal hostility was relatively more important than both paternal hostility and maternal warmth in predicting adolescent aggression among adolescent girls and boys. However, paternal parenting was more important for boys at specific ages. Findings are discussed in terms of implications for interventions and further research on parenting.

Variability in Infant Helping and Sharing Behaviors Across the Second and Third Years of Life: Differential Roles of Target and Socialization	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Infants can help and share in the second year of life. However, there is limited knowledge as to variability in these behaviors as a function of target (e.g., caregiver vs. unfamiliar adult) and the influence of caregiver support on infant prosocial behavior. Infants (N = 268, 124 female) at 1-2 years of age (M = 1.47, SD = .27) and again at 2-3 years of age (M = 2.48, SD = .26) participated in a helping task (with the caregiver or unfamiliar experimenter), a sharing task (with either target), and a free-play observation with their primary caregiver from which caregiver support was coded. The racial and ethnic composition of the sample consisted of 3% Asian, 10% Black, 20% Hispanic, 59% White, 1% mixed race, and 6% "other." Median family annual income was $50,000 to $59,000, and median caregiver education level was "some college." Infant helping favored caregivers at both time points. However, infant sharing did not differ by target for 1-2-year-olds, but 2-3-year-olds shared more with their caregivers than an unfamiliar experimenter. Additionally, infants' behaviors antecedent to the act of helping or sharing (e.g., latency to respond, checking behaviors, and looking duration toward the target) differed by target. Concurrent relations between caregiver support and helping and sharing were moderated by age and differed by time point. Caregiver support for 1-2-year-olds also longitudinally predicted an age-moderated relation with 2-3-year-olds' helping toward an unfamiliar experimenter. Theoretical implications for the role of socialization in the emergence of helping and sharing behaviors are discussed.

J	Moed, A				Moed, Anat			Mothers' Aversion Sensitivity and Reciprocal Negativity in Mother-Child Interactions: Implications for Coercion Theory	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Coercion theory well characterizes the behavioral aspects that often lead to dysfunctional family processes. Recent conceptualizations have incorporated emotion into models of coercive interactions, yet empirical evidence has been limited. In this study, repeated measures of mother-child dyads (N = 319) were assessed over the course of 2 years to examine whether within-mother (i.e., intraindividual) levels of aversion sensitivity-their negative emotional arousal when faced with aversive child behavior-are associated with four known components of coercive parent-child interactions: initiation, length, frequency, and the tendency to end the negative cycle. During multiple assessments over 2 years, conflictual conversations between newly divorced mothers (M-baseline age = 36.8, SDbaseline age = 6.6; 64% non-Hispanic White) and their 4- to 11-year-old children (M-baseline age = 7.77, SDbaseline age = 2.0; 52% female) were observed and microcoded. Forty-seven observed child behaviors were ranked from low to high aversive. Mothers' general rates of negative emotional expression and the rates at which their negative expression increased as children's behavior became increasingly aversive (i.e., their aversion sensitivity) were recorded. Results were consistent with coercion theory, revealing significant within-dyad associations between mothers' aversion sensitivity and all four components of coercive parent-child interactions. These findings suggest the importance of understanding the functions that parents' intraindividual emotional processes have in difficult, coercive family processes. Understanding such processes holds promise for clarifying how to intervene to reduce parent-child interactions known to be problematic for children's development.

DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Individual differences in the quality of early experiences with primary caregivers have been reliably implicated in the development of socioemotional adjustment and, more recently, physical health. However, few studies have examined the development of such associations with physical health into the adult years. To that end, the current study used prospective, longitudinal data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 1,306, 52% male, 77% White/non-Hispanic) to investigate whether associations between direct observations of maternal sensitivity in the first 3 years of life and repeated assessments of two commonly used, objective indicators of physical health (i.e., body mass and mean arterial blood pressure) remained stable or diminished in magnitude over time. Associations between early maternal sensitivity and lower body mass remained relatively stable from age 54 months to 26 years and were robust to the modeling of autoregressive and second-order stability processes as well as the inclusion of potential demographic confounders. In contrast, although associations between early caregiving and lower mean arterial pressure remained relatively stable from Grade 4 to age 15 years (the oldest age for which mean arterial pressure was assessed thus far), these associations were not robust to the inclusion of covariates and the modeling of second-order stability processes.

The Stability of Early Developing Attentional Bias for Faces and Fear From 8 to 30 and 60 Months in the FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Most infants exhibit an attentional bias for faces and fearful facial expressions. These biases reduce toward the third year of life, but little is known about the development of the biases beyond early childhood. We used the same methodology longitudinally to assess attention disengagement patterns from nonface control pictures and faces (neutral, happy, and fearful expressions) in a large sample of children at 8, 30, and 60 months (N = 389/393/492, respectively; N = 72 for data in all three assessment; girls >45.3% in each assessment). "Face bias" was measured as a difference in disengagement probability (DP) from faces (neutral/happy) versus nonface patterns. "Fear bias" was calculated as a difference in DP for fearful versus happy/neutral faces. At group level, DPs followed a nonlinear longitudinal trajectory in all face conditions, being lowest at 8 months, highest at 30 months, and intermediate at 60 months. Face bias declined between 8 and 30 months, but did not change between 30 and 60 months. Fear bias declined linearly from 8 to 60 months. Individual differences in disengagement were generally not stable across age, but weak correlations were found in face bias between 8- and 60-month, and in DPs between 30- and 60-month (rs = .22-.41). The results suggest that prioritized attention to faces-that is, a hallmark of infant cognition and a key aspect of human social behavior-follows a nonlinear trajectory in early childhood and may have only weak continuity from infancy to mid childhood.

J	Finch, JE; Wolf, S; Lichand, G				Finch, Jenna E.; Wolf, Sharon; Lichand, Guilherme			Executive Functions, Motivation, and Children's Academic Development in Cote d'Ivoire	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The role of executive function skills and motivation in supporting children's academic achievement is well-documented, but the vast majority of evidence is from high-income countries. Classrooms in sub-Saharan Africa tend to be large, teacher-driven, and lecture-focused, which may provide extra challenges for children to stay engaged in the learning process. Based in self-regulated learning theory, we tested the contributions of executive functions and motivation for children's literacy and numeracy skills over 1 school year. Our preregistered study of 2,500 primary school students in Cote d'Ivoire used lagged models with a robust set of demographic covariates. Executive functions were directly assessed, and children reported on their levels of motivation for schooling. Findings indicated strong longitudinal continuity of both literacy and numeracy skills over the academic year. Further, we found unique associations of executive functions and intrinsic motivation with changes in children's literacy skills and a unique association of executive functions, but not intrinsic motivation, with changes in children's numeracy skills over the school year. Overall, these results provide evidence for the importance of nonacademic skills for children's learning in a rural, sub-Saharan African context. Implications include improving access to preprimary education, the quality of primary school experiences, and teacher training and supports to increase children's early academic skills, self-regulation skills, and motivation for learning.

For this reason, this transition might create important challenges and opportunities for identity formation. The present mixed-method longitudinal study examined identity formation processes in a sample of Georgian final-year undergraduate students over an 11-month period at four different points before and after graduation. At time 1, 369 participants (20% male, mean age = 21.83) completed self-report questionnaires. Life narratives were collected from a subsample of 40 individuals who participated at the last (i.e., fourth) time point. Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was used to identify developmental typologies of identity formation based on dimensions of commitment and exploration, collected at all four time points. Four trajectory classes-Moratorium, Foreclosure, Troubled Diffusion, and Undifferentiated-were identified. Qualitative results suggest that childhood and family relationships, independence/autonomy/adulthood, education/occupation, and romantic relationships represented salient identity related themes among the study participants. Narratives of trajectory representatives provided insights and the phenomenological accounts of emerging adults' experiences during the transition and highlight specific characteristics of each trajectory class.

Racial Discrimination Predicts Depressive Symptoms Throughout Adolescence Among Black Youth BRIEF REPORT	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Experiences of racial discrimination are common among Black youth and predict worse mental health cross-sectionally and over time. Additional research is needed to address lingering questions regarding the direction of effect(s) underlying these patterns, differences in the magnitude of effects across adolescence, and gender differences. To address these gaps, the current study tested bidirectional linkages between racial discrimination and depressive symptoms at the between- (interpersonal) and within- (intrapersonal) level using 4 waves of data from 889 Black youth (54% female) from Georgia and Iowa. Participants reported experiences of racial discrimination and depressive symptoms at ages 10.6 years (Wave 1), 12.5 years (Wave 2), 15.7 years (Wave 3), and 18.8 years (Wave 4). The cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) was used to examine between-person associations over time, and the random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) was used to examine within-person associations over time. Results were consistent across models, revealing significant concurrent associations between racial discrimination and depressive symptoms, significant lagged effects from racial discrimination to depressive symptoms, and no significant lagged effects from depressive symptoms to racial discrimination. Effects did not differ across adolescence, and there were few gender differences in the degree of association between racial discrimination and depressive symptoms. Findings provide rigorous evidence that experiencing greater racial discrimination is associated with increases in depressive symptoms throughout adolescence and add to a growing body of work showing that racial discrimination can undermine mental health and well-being among Black youth.

Statistical Power for Longitudinal Developmental Trajectories: The (Non-)Impact of Age Matching Within Measurement Occasions	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Recruiting participants for studies of early-life longitudinal development is challenging, often resulting in practical upper bounds in sample size and missing data due to attrition. These factors pose risks for the statistical power of such studies depending on the intended analytic model. One mitigation strategy is to increase measurement precision by conducting assessments of children as close to a fixed chronological age as possible. We present analyses that illustrate how such practices are only sometimes useful, focusing on cases where temporal trajectories are analyzed using multilevel modeling approaches. Simulations were conducted using results from two studies of longitudinal development. Data were generated according to both continuous and discrete developmental processes and factorially analyzed treating time on either interval, ordinal, or categorical scales. The power to detect continuously generated developmental processes was robust to, and even benefited from, increased variability around target ages. For discrete processes, power was unaffected when modeled ordinally/categorically, but declined steadily if modeled using exact chronological age on an interval scale. Our results suggest that in many circumstances, researchers may be unnecessarily devoting resources toward minimizing age sampling variability when studying functional patterns across time. In fact, when the theoretical developmental process is continuous, increasing the age sampling variability of assessments and utilizing multilevel models in favor of latent growth curve alternatives can be associated with substantial gains rather than reductions in power. Such considerations also extend to limited equivalent formulations of other common developmental models, such as panel analysis. Public Significance Statement Collecting data aimed at investigating critical early developmental processes is often difficult and expensive. We show that heuristics aimed toward collecting data from children within restricted age ranges can counterintuitively undermine the detection of true effects. Given the value of individual data points, more flexible data collection practices can increase both the amount of data collected and the robustness of inferences.

J	Burger, K				Burger, Kaspar			Disentangling the Interplay of the Sense of Belonging and Institutional Channels in Individuals' Educational Trajectories	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Accumulating evidence indicates that students' sense of school belonging has a substantial positive effect on educational attainment. At the same time, life course and life span developmental theories suggest that the benefits of a sense of school belonging could be weakened by the channeling effects of education systems that assign students to distinct educational tracks that lead otherwise similar students to quite different educational destinations. The current study analyzed the extent to which the sense of school belonging predicted educational trajectories in a system that partially channels students into distinct tracks. It assessed educational trajectories as they relate to transitions at two critical junctures of the system-the transition from lower- to upper-secondary education, and from upper-secondary to tertiary (university) education. The study used data from a nationally representative panel survey that followed participants from age 15 to 30 (N = 4,986, 44% male, 12.9% immigrants). Findings indicated that students with a stronger sense of school belonging were more likely to continue in or transition into academic tracks. However, the benefits of students' sense of belonging were bounded by the system's channeling structure. While for students in academic tracks, the sense of school belonging strongly predicted the probability of continuing in academic tracks, it only marginally predicted the probability of moving into academic tracks for those whose educational career began in more vocationally oriented tracks. Hence the sense of school belonging may influence academic trajectories only inasmuch as institutional structures allow it to, because these structures differentially enable and constrain such trajectories.

The adolescents reported on their academic attitudes and anxiety and their teachers reported on their in-class attentive behavior in 7th to 9th grade. There were no sex differences on the general algebra measure or for mathematics achievement, but boys had an advantage on the algebra word problems measure (d = .51) and for spatial abilities (ds = .29 to .58). Boys had higher mathematics self-efficacy (d = .24 to .33), lower mathematics anxiety (ds = -.31 to -.53) and were less attentive in classrooms (ds = -.28 to -.37). A series of structural equation models revealed the sex difference for algebra word problems was mediated by spatial abilities and mathematics anxiety, controlling myriad confounds. Public Significance Statement Sex differences in mathematics are typically small but larger for word problems. The latter assess the ability to use mathematics in problem-solving situations and are often included on high-stakes tests. Boys' higher spatial abilities appeared to provide them with an advantage and girls' mathematics anxiety a disadvantage in solving algebra word problems.

Early-Adolescent Dual Language Learners' Reading Comprehension: Influences of Teacher Questions and Language Efficacy	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examined the relation between middle school Dual Language Learners' (DLLs'; N = 413; M age = 11.66 years old; 87.1% Latino; female = 234, male = 179) reading comprehension skills and their teachers' (N = 32; M age = 36.53 years; 81.3% Caucasian; female = 27, male = 5) questioning practices across the school year. This study also examined relations between DLLs' engagement in high-quality discussion practices, language efficacy (i.e., beliefs about their capabilities to use language), and reading comprehension. Results demonstrated that teachers' use of authentic (open-ended) questions was positively related to their DLL students' reading comprehension; teachers' questioning practices were consistent across the year. Results also revealed a positive interaction between DLLs' high-quality discussion practices and their language efficacy in predicting reading comprehension. That is, when DLLs had higher language efficacy, there was a more positive effect of their high-quality discussion practices on their Spring reading comprehension scores. These findings suggest that teachers' questioning practices are important in creating classroom environments that promote DLLs' reading comprehension.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				JAN	2023	59	1					173	185		10.1037/dev0001453	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001453		SEP 2022						36048098					WOS:000847817100001

How Does Inhibitory Control Predict Emotion Regulation in Preschool? The Role of Individual Children's Interactions With Teachers and Peers	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Emotion regulation is foundational to children's psychological wellbeing and future school adjustment. As young children are spending increasing amounts of time in preschool programs, investigating how early childhood classrooms can foster emotion regulation development is warranted. In this study, we tested individual children's interactions with teachers and peers as potential mechanisms through which inhibitory control supports emotion regulation in the preschool classroom. Participants included 767 preschool children (49% female; M = 4.39 years old, SD = .08) from low-income households (income-to-needs ratio M = 1.45, SD = 1.06). Fifty percent of children were Black, 22% White, 13% Latino, and 15% Other race/ethnicity. Children completed direct assessments of inhibitory control in the fall, teachers reported on children's emotion regulation in the fall and spring of the preschool year, and trained observers rated the quality of individual children's interactions with teachers and peers in the fall, winter, and spring. Accounting for earlier emotion regulation, mediation analyses indicated that children's inhibitory control operates through individual children's (a) positive interactions with peers and (b) negative interactions with teachers and peers to support their subsequent emotion regulation. These findings underscore the role of the preschool classroom as an emotion socialization context for children from low-income households, along with providing additional evidence about the importance of social interactions to understand children's emotional development in context.

Exploring the Foundations of Early Scientific Literacy: Children's Causal Stance	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												From an early age, children show a keen interest in discovering the causal structure of the world around them. Given how fundamental causal information is to scientific inquiry and knowledge, this early emerging "causal stance" might be important in propelling the development of scientific literacy. However, currently little is known about the development of children's causal stance, or how it might relate to concurrent or subsequent scientific literacy. In this study, 153 children from diverse backgrounds were evaluated at 3, 4, 5, and 6 years of age. Results demonstrate that causal stance at 3 years of age consistently predicted scientific literacy at each wave of data collection, extending through preschool, kindergarten, and into first grade. This relation was particularly pronounced across the earliest 2 measurement time-points, when children's causal stance predicted growth in scientific literacy above and beyond initial scores. The reciprocal relation did not hold: scientific literacy did not predict future causal stance. Implications for school readiness and early STEM engagement are discussed.

Friends' Discussions of Interpersonal and Noninterpersonal Problems During Early and Middle Adolescence: Associations With Co-Rumination	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Friendships are important sources of support during adolescence. However, a growing literature indicates some adolescents co-ruminate, or talk with friends about problems in a way that is excessive, speculative, and negatively focused, which confers risk for internalizing problems. Still, previous research had not examined the types of problems co-ruminators discuss. Using self-reported co-rumination and observations of friends' conversations about problems, the present study of early and middle adolescents addressed this gap. Participants (N = 628) were approximately half female (52% of the sample) and primarily European American and African American (63% and 29% of the sample, respectively). Adolescents who reported greater co-rumination spent more time discussing interpersonal problems with friends. including problems with families, peers, and romantic interests. Interpersonal problems may lend themselves to co-rumination because they can be ambiguous. multifaceted, and difficult to resolve. In contrast, co-rumination was not related spending more time discussing noninterpersonal problems. In addition, middle adolescent were observed to spend more time than early adolescents discussing problems related to developmentally salient tasks (e.g., romantic relationships, academics), and girls spent more time than boys discussing interpersonal problems. Taken together, the findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of co-rumination. Moreover, the study has applied implications in that findings suggest that adolescents experiencing interpersonal problems may be at elevated risk of co-ruminating. In addition to steering these adolescents away from co-rumination, fostering better problem-solving skills for interpersonal problems may lead to die resolution of these problems before they become topics of co-rumination.

J.; Turkmani, Sabera			Reducing Educational Disparities Between Australian Adolescents in Regional and Metropolitan Communities: The Compensatory Effects of Extracurricular Activities	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Australian adolescents living in regional communities are significantly more likely to perform worse at school, relative to those in metropolitan communities. These disparities are partially due to the development of lower educational expectations among regional adolescents. In the current study, we tested whether the differences in educational expectations across communities were reduced when adolescents engage in extracurricular activities, and any subsequent downstream effects on academic outcomes. The current study used a subsample of 1,477 adolescents recruited as part of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children who have graduated from high school. Using a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model, we found that residing in a regional community at the start of secondary education predicted worse academic performance when graduating 6 years later. This association was partially mediated by lower educational expectations and school functioning, measured biennially. However, the significant difference between adolescents in metropolitan and regional communities dissipated when participants engaged in three or more types of extracurricular activities. These results highlight that increasing access and support to participate in extracurricular activities in regional communities may contribute to reducing inequities in educational outcomes.

Multivariate Growth Trajectories of Parenting Practices in Adolescence Predicting Young Adult Relationships With Parents	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Guided by the life course perspective, this study investigated the developmental antecedents of contact, closeness/warmth, and negativity in young adults' relationships with their parents. Taking the developmental systems approach, we considered interindividual differences in not only initial levels of parenting quality in early adolescence (Grade 6) but also developmental changes in parenting quality across adolescence (Grades 6-12) as predictors of young adult-parent relationship quality. Data were from a large sample of young adults (N = 1,631; M-age = 22.84; 57% female; 90% White; 25% received free/reduced-price school lunch in Grade 6) followed from the fall of Grades 6 to 12 at eight time points, plus a young adult assessment. Using multivariate latent growth curve modeling, we identified a nuanced pattern of predictors of the three relationship dimensions. Higher initial levels of and lower rates of decline in parental involvement across adolescence predicted more young adult contact with mothers and fathers. Higher initial levels of parental warmth and parental involvement, as well as lower rates of decline in parental warmth, predicted greater closeness/warmth with mothers and fathers in young adulthood. Higher initial levels of and lower rates of decline in effective discipline predicted less young adult negativity toward mothers and fathers. These results held even when accounting for important adolescent and young adult covariates (adolescent sex and race, adolescent family income and structure, adolescent aggressive behavior tendencies, young adult living arrangement). The study offers new insights into how parenting practices in adolescence contribute to parent-child relationship in young adulthood.

Participants included 1,864 elementary school students (945 boys, M-age = 11 years) in China. One-year longitudinal data on social competence, academic functioning, and psychological problems were obtained from peer nominations, teacher ratings, school records, and self-reports. Multilevel structural equation modeling analysis showed that group-level social competence, academic performance, and psychological problems had significant same-domain effects on later individual outcomes. Moreover, group-level social competence had a positive cross-domain effect on later individual academic performance and a negative cross-domain effect on later individual psychological problems. Group academic performance had a positive cross-domain effect on later individual social competence, and group psychological problems had a negative cross-domain effect on later individual social competence. The results suggest that affiliation with peer groups, particularly socially competent groups, may have pervasive implications for children's performance and adjustment from a developmental perspective.

J	Hunter, BK; Markant, J				Hunter, Brianna K.; Markant, Julie			Caregiver Faces Capture 6-to 10-Year-Old Children's Attention During an Online Visual Search Task	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Developing attention skills allow children to parse their complex world by orienting to a subset of especially salient or meaningful inputs. Infants and children are biased to orient to faces and have difficulty ignoring faces when they appear as distractors. Although these past findings suggest that faces are more salient than nonsocial stimuli, it is unclear whether specific types of faces capture attention to a greater extent than others. Caregiver faces are one of the most prevalent and socially motivating stimuli in infants' and children's environments, suggesting that they may be biased to orient to caregiver faces to a greater extent than faces in general. Forty-six 6- to 10-year-old children across the United States and Canada completed an online attention capture task in which participants searched for a target within arrays containing multiple distractors. During some trials, either a stranger or the child's caregiver's face appeared as one of the distractors. Children showed consistently poorer performance (i.e., increased omission errors, poorer accuracy, and slower response times) when the caregiver face appeared as a distractor, especially during trials in which the target was present and within larger search arrays. These increased performance costs indicate an enhanced orienting bias to caregiver faces, which may reflect increased motivational salience of these faces.

Mothers' and Fathers' Mind-Mindedness in Infancy and Toddlerhood Predict Their Children's Self-Regulation at Preschool Age	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The ability to regulate one's emotions and behaviors is essential for adaptive functioning in society. We investigated whether parental mind-mindedness-parents' tendency to treat their children as mental agents-in infancy and toddlerhood predicts school-age children's self-regulation. The sample consisted of 125 mostly Dutch and White families. We assessed mothers' and fathers' appropriate and nonattuned mind-related comments during free play with their 12- and 30-month-old child (70 girls and 55 boys). We measured children's physiological, temperamental, and behavioral self-regulation when children were 4 1/2 years old. Fathers' appropriate mind-related comments predicted children's higher temperamental and behavioral self-regulation and mothers' and fathers' nonattuned mind-related comments predicted children's lower physiological and temperamental self-regulation. Our findings emphasize the importance of both parents' mind-mindedness in children's socioemotional development.

However, little longitudinal research has examined the implications of distinctive combinations of social support for students' study wellbeing. To address this limitation, we measured multiple dimensions of school-related social support (teacher, peer, and guardian support), study engagement, and study-related burnout in a sample of 1,545 Finnish lower secondary school students in Grades 7, 8, and 9 (age 13, girls 51%). Latent transition analyses identified a six-profile solution for each wave of data and revealed substantial inequality in perceived social support. First, we found four profiles where social support from all three sources was experienced either on high, moderate, low, or very low level labeled as strong support (33%), moderate support (43%), low support (13%), and exceptionally low support (3%), respectively. In addition, two "mixed profiles" were found, where a low level of social support from one source was combined with moderate levels of social support from two other sources. These two profiles were labeled as adult support (5%) and low teacher support (3%) profiles. The social support profiles differed from each other in terms of study engagement and study-related burnout, suggesting that social support from specific sources has a somewhat different effect on features of students' study wellbeing. Moreover, the results showed that the experiences of school-related social support and study wellbeing are prone to change, highlighting the importance of each source of support throughout the students' school path.

DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Adults often act considerately toward others, for example, by leaving the last cookie on a plate or stepping aside on a busy sidewalk. What do young children infer from observing considerate behavior? In three preregistered studies, we assess how young children evaluate considerate and inconsiderate behavior by showing them animated videos in which targets make decisions that either leave or limit choice options for others. Study 1 (N = 372 6- to 12-year-old children, 170 girls, 187 boys [15 not reported], 84.4% native Dutch) showed that older children, but not younger children (i.e., 6 years), evaluated considerate others (i.e., who leave a choice for others) as nicer than inconsiderate others, and they were also more willing to lend their toys to them. Moreover, children's evaluations were specific to the social domain, as children of all ages evaluated both targets as equally smart. Focusing on younger children (5-7 years), study 2 (N = 99; 57 boys, 42 girls, 78.8% native Dutch) showed that when the consequences of considerate or inconsiderate behavior were made explicit and videos showed one target at a time, children as young as 5 years old evaluated considerate targets as nicer. Study 3 (N = 43; 20 boys, 23 girls, 92.5% native Dutch) showed that young children also evaluated considerate behavior as nicer when the consequences of considerate behavior were not made explicit. These studies extend developmental research on prosocial behavior and suggest that considerate behavior conveys a clear social signal early in life.

The Ability to Use Contextual Cues to Achieve Phonological Constancy Emerges by 14 Months	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The ability to map similar sounding words to different meanings alone is far from enough for successful speech processing. To overcome variability in the speech signal, young learners must also recognize words across surface variations. Previous studies have shown that infants at 14 months are able to use variations in word-internal cues (i.e., acoustic cues within the target word) to form phonological categories and to learn words. The present study takes into consideration the fact that talker variability can easily lead to acoustic overlap between phonological categories, in which case reliance on word-external cues (i.e., acoustic cues in the context preceding and/or following the target word, also referred to as contextual cues) as a frame of reference is obligatory for successful talker adaptation. In a series of experiments, the present study examines when infants are able to use word-external cues to tune to different talkers for the benefit of word learning. Cantonese-learning 14-month-old, 18-month-old, and 24-month-old infants (N = 258) were tested on the associative learning of Cantonese Tone 1-Tone 3 contrast. Results showed that talker variability that yielded acoustic overlap between the two tonal categories compromised infants' ability to map the contrast onto word meanings. However, when given speaker-matched contextual cues, infants as young as 14 months of age demonstrated a certain degree of talker adaptation which may have subserved their use of phonetic details in novel word learning.

Developmental Antecedents of Friendship Satisfaction in Adulthood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Cross-sectional studies have shown that greater friendship satisfaction in adulthood is associated with many positive outcomes (Chopik, 2017; Gillespie, Frederick, et al., 2015). However, the developmental antecedents of satisfaction with close friends in adulthood have not been examined using prospective data. We do not know, for example, whether certain key experiences early in life, such as infant attachment security versus insecurity or the quality of maternal sensitivity, prospectively predict the degree of satisfaction with close friends in adulthood. We also do not know whether other salient experiences, such as the degree of peer competence in childhood or friendship security in adolescence, mediate relations between early life attachment and/or maternal sensitivity and adult friendship satisfaction. Leveraging data from the Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaption, we examined four developmental models containing these theoretically relevant antecedents of friendship satisfaction at age 32. The sample was approximately evenly split by gender (female = 82, male = 76), with the following ethnic distribution: White = 67.1%. Black = 8.9%, mixed race = 18.4%. other = 5.6%. All participants were born to mothers living below the poverty line at birth but on average were lower middle class by age 32. We found that the model containing direct paths from infant attachment security versus insecurity and from the quality of maternal sensitivity to friendship satisfaction at age 32 provided the best fit. suggesting that early parent-child relationships provide a foundation for later adult relationships with close friends. The implications of these findings are discussed.

This study tested an integrated model of language development within a longitudinal data set of 1.894 socioeconomically diverse Korean children (48.35% girls; > 99% native-born Korean citizens) from the first year of life (age 3-8 months) to ages 3 and 6 years. A model integrating parent and environmental characteristics from the family stress model and the family investment model that also included maternal self-efficacy and knowledge of child development was shown to adequately explain the associations between family socioeconomic status and children's language development. Implications for applying similar integrated models in international contexts are discussed.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				NOV	2022	58	11					2081	2095		10.1037/dev0001408	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001408		AUG 2022						35951396					WOS:000838265500001

Here, factors relating to older siblings (their presence in the house, sex, and age gap), mothers (maternal stress), and household size and residential crowding were assessed to systematically examine the different roles of these factors. Data from mother-child dyads in a Singaporean birth cohort, (677-855 dyads; 52% males; 58% to 61% Chinese, 20% to 24% Malay, 17% to 19% Indian) collected when children were 24, 48, and 54 months old, were analyzed. There was a negative effect of having an older sibling, moderated by the siblings' age gap, but not by the older sibling's sex, nor household size or residential crowding. Maternal stress affected language outcomes in some analyses but not others. Implications for understanding the possible effects of family structure on language development are discussed.

Examining Longitudinal Associations Between Internalizing Problems, Body Mass Index, and Language During Childhood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The current study examines the extent to which associations between internalizing problems, body mass index (BMI), and language skills from early (36 months) to late childhood (fifth grade) are due to relatively stable between-child differences, time-specific correlations, or cross-lagged paths. Data from the NICHD study, Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 1,364) were used. Results showed that internalizing problems and language are significantly and negatively correlated due to relatively stable between-child differences, with some evidence of positive cross-lagged paths, where better language at 36 months, 54 months, and third grade predicted more internalizing problems at the subsequent timepoint, and more internalizing problems at third grade predicted better language at fifth grade. Time-specific associations for BMI showed a negative correlation with language at 36 months and a positive correlation with internalizing problems at 54 months only. Additionally, higher internalizing at third grade predicted higher BMI at fifth grade, though the association was small and no other cross-lagged paths between internalizing and BMI emerged. These findings suggest that previous research documenting cross-lagged associations between BMI and internalizing problems, and between language and internalizing problems may be biased due to between child differences not fully controlled for in prior models. Implications for understanding these key aspects of youth's healthy development are considered.

We explored whether negative information about snakes and spiders from parents shapes children's fear beliefs. Study 1 included 27 parents (22 mothers, five fathers) and children (12 female, 15 male, M-age = 5.33 years, 18 White, one Hispanic, eight more than one race). Most parents reported having an advanced degree (78%) and an annual household income of above $100,000 (74%). Participants read an animal picture book and then rated their fear toward each animal. Study 2 included 54 parents (44 mothers, eight fathers, two legal guardians) and children (27 female, 27 male, M-age = 5.52 years, 30 White, one Hispanic, seven Asian/Pacific Islander, four South Asian/Indian, 12 more than one race). Most parents reported holding an AA/BA degree (28%) or an advanced degree (59%) and reported an annual household income of $60,000-$100,000 (28%) or above $100,000 (59%). In Study 2, half of the parents were primed about how their conversations might shape children's fear prior to reading the book. Across both studies, we found that participants provided more negative than positive information about snakes and spiders and provided less positive (Study 1) and more negative (Study 2) information compared to other animals. Our results highlight the prominence of negative information in conversations about snakes and spiders and suggest that the way parents talk about these animals may shape the development of children's fears.

Parents' Math Anxiety and Their Controlling and Autonomy-Supportive Involvement in Children's Math Learning: Implications for Children's Math Achievement	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This research examined how parents' math anxiety is associated with their controlling and autonomy-supportive involvement in children's math learning; the contribution of such involvement to children's math achievement was also evaluated. Parents (N = 562; 62% White, 21% Black; 65% with at least a bachelor's degree) of young elementary school children (M-age = 7.48 years; 50% girls) reported on their math anxiety as well as controlling and autonomy-supportive involvement in children's math learning; observations were also made. At the same time and a year later, children's math achievement was assessed. Parents with higher math anxiety were more controlling (in both parents' reports and the observations) and less autonomy supportive (only in the observations) with children who had poorer math achievement. Notably, controlling parenting (in both parents' reports and the observations) was most likely to predict lower math achievement a year later among such children. The findings suggest math-anxious parents are prone to using practices with children struggling in math that further undermine their math achievement, which can create an unconstructive cycle for children's math learning.

Perceptions of the Future in Adolescence Predict Depressive Symptoms in Adolescence and Early and Middle Adulthood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The current longitudinal study examined the predictive associations between the development of future perceptions in adolescence and depressive symptoms in adolescence and early and middle adulthood. Participants (N = 1,527; 48.3% female; broadly representative of Western Germany with respect to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status) were measured yearly in adolescence at the age of 12 to 16 years and then in adulthood at the age of 35 and 45. Future perceptions were assessed during adolescence, whereas depressive symptoms were assessed at the age of 16, 35, and 45. Three important results stand out. First, the measure of future perceptions functioned equivalently across adolescence. Second, the development of future perceptions during adolescence varied across individuals, though mean-level stability was evidenced in the sample. Third, individual differences in the level and change of future perceptions during adolescence predicted depressive symptoms in adolescence and adulthood. These findings demonstrate that one's perception of the future not only has short-term affective consequences but may have long-term effects on depressive symptoms beyond adolescence.

Consistency of Gender Identity and Preferences Across Time: An Exploration Among Cisgender and Transgender Children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												While considerable research has examined gender development in middle childhood, little longitudinal work has been conducted at this time to indicate whether, for example, youth who show more or less gender conformity at one point continue to do so later. The present study investigated the consistency of gender identity and preferences for gender-stereotypical toys, clothing, and same-gender peer preferences among groups of transgender youth (n = 158), their siblings (n = 79), and an unrelated group of cisgender youth (n = 128) from a mean age of 7.0 (range 3.0-10.9) to a mean age of 9.6 (range 5.1-12.0). Furthermore, 65.5% of the youth were girls, 69.7% were White, 72.8% grew up in households with an annual household income of $75,000 or more, and 89.9% of parents had a bachelor's degree or higher. Overall, we found a small-to-medium correlation over this 2.6-year span within each group, both across the composite of measures and most measures individually. Despite the moderate stability over time, we found a decrease in the composite and individual scores over this time span for girls and for transgender participants. Together these results suggested some stability in children's gender identity and preferences in middle childhood and that this was true regardless of whether the child's gender did or did not align with their sex assignment at birth.					; Hassler, Tabea/C-5244-2017	Glazier, Jessica/0000-0001-7755-5651; Hassler, Tabea/0000-0002-9371-2423													0012-1649	1939-0599				NOV	2022	58	11					2184	2196		10.1037/dev0001419	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001419		AUG 2022						35951394					WOS:000838263900001

An Examination of Additive, Mediated, and Moderated Effects of Early Family Stress, Daily Interpersonal Stress, and Physiological Stress	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Early life stress, daily life experiences, and the stress responsive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis have each been examined as predictors of the development of psychopathology. Rarely have researchers attempted to understand the covariation or interaction among these stress domains using a longitudinal design in the prediction of symptoms of internalizing psychopathology, particularly during childhood. This study examined early family stress, daily interpersonal stress, indicators of diurnal cortisol, and internalizing symptoms in a racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of twins (N = 970 children; M-age at outcome = 9.73; 52% female; 23.7% Hispanic/Latino, 58.8% White; 30% below middle class; Lemery-Chalfant et al., 2019). An additive model of stress, a stress mediation model, and a stress sensitization framework model each delineated potential pathways linking stress and internalizing symptoms. Supporting additive pathways, multilevel models showed that all 3 stress indicators uniquely predicted internalizing symptoms. There was a significant indirect path from early family stress to 9 year internalizing symptoms through interpersonal stress, supporting stress mediation. Family stress moderated the association between interpersonal stress and internalizing symptoms, though not in the direction that would support stress sensitization. Child stress, including daily interpersonal stress and HPA axis activity, and internalizing symptoms are prevalent and family stress is a significant precursor to child internalizing symptoms across child development.

False Belief Understanding and Moral Judgment in Young Children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Although the influence of intent understanding on children's moral development has been long studied, little research has examined the influence of belief understanding on that development. In two studies we presented children with morally relevant belief vignettes to examine the extent to which they incorporate both intent and belief information in their moral judgments. In Study 1 (N = 64), 5-year-olds with higher false belief understanding (FBU) rated agents with false beliefs as more positively intentioned in good intent trials (even though the outcome was bad) than in bad intent trials (even though the outcome was good). In contrast, 4-year-olds with higher FBU were generally unable to integrate their belief understanding with their moral evaluations, performing no better on intention questions than children with lower FBU. Neither age group significantly differentiated reward and punishments as a function of intent when a false belief was involved. In Study 2 (N = 109 children, N = 42 adults), we found that by simplifying our study design and reducing the task demands, 4-year-olds with higher FBU were able to make appropriate intent judgments. Yet, as in Study 1, all children had difficulty assigning punishment/reward based on intent. For both moral intentions and moral consequences, 4- and 5-year-olds with higher FBU differed from those of adults in several respects, indicating that moral reasoning develops substantially beyond the preschool years.					; Moses, Louis/G-7327-2017	Rodini, Joseph/0000-0003-0042-2978; Moses, Louis/0000-0001-5588-5713; Ochoa, Karlena/0000-0002-2283-4810													0012-1649	1939-0599				NOV	2022	58	11					2022	2035		10.1037/dev0001411	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001411		JUL 2022						35816589					WOS:000822080100001

An In-Laboratory Stressor Reveals Unique Genetic Variation in Child Cortisol Output	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Dysregulation of biological stress response, as measured by cortisol output, has been a primary candidate mechanism for how social experiences become biologically embedded. Cortisol is the primary output of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis. Cortisol levels vary systematically across the day and change in response to both sudden, acute stress experiences as well as prolonged exposure to environmental stress. Using data from 8- to 15-year-old twins in the Texas Twin Project, we investigate the extent to which genetic influences are shared across different measures of cortisol output: chronic cortisol accumulations in hair (n = 1,104), diurnal variation in salivary output (n = 488), and salivary response to a standardized, acute in-laboratory stressor (n = 537). Multivariate twin models indicate that genetic factors regulating cortisol response to the in-laboratory stressor are separable from those regulating baseline cortisol levels, naturally occurring diurnal variation in cortisol, and hair cortisol levels. These findings illustrate that novel environments can reveal unique genetic variation, reordering people in terms of their observed phenotype rather than only magnifying or mitigating preexisting differences.

Participants were 272 Chinese mother-child dyads. Maternal socialization goals of child autonomy and obedience were assessed when the child was 6 months old. Maternal respect for autonomy and negative control were observed in free-plays at 15 months. Mothers reported child compliance and inhibitory control at 25 months and rated child externalizing behaviors at 37 months. Results showed that for children with low levels of compliance or high levels of inhibitory control, obedience socialization goals predicted more externalizing behaviors, whereas for children with high levels of compliance or low levels of inhibitory control, obedience socialization goals predicted fewer externalizing behaviors. Moreover, for children with high levels of inhibitory control, higher levels of respect for autonomy or lower levels of negative control foretold fewer externalizing behaviors. Conversely, for children with low levels of inhibitory control, lower levels of respect for autonomy or higher levels of negative control forecasted fewer externalizing behaviors. Together, our findings demonstrate that socialization expectations, socialization practices, and child characteristics are jointly predictive of social adjustment across early childhood and all the significant interactions are characterized by the pattern of a contrastive effect, therefore congruently supporting the goodness-of-fit hypotheses.

Working Memory Development From Early Childhood to Adolescence Using Two Nationally Representative Samples	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We leveraged nationally representative data from the Panel study of Income Dynamics-Child Development Supplement (N = 3,562) and the Early Childhood Longitudinal study (N = 18,174), to chart the development of working memory, indexed via verbal forward and backward digit span task performance, from 3 to 19 years of age. Results revealed nonlinear growth patterns for forward and backward digit span tasks, with the most rapid growth occurring during childhood followed by a brief accelerated period of growth during early adolescence. We also found similar developmental trajectories on digit span task performance for males and females across the U.S. population. Together, this study highlights the relative importance of the childhood period for working memory development and provides researchers with a reference against which to compare the developmental changes of working memory in individual studies. From a practical perspective, clinicians and educators can also use this information to understand important periods of working memory growth using national developmental trends.

Sibling Differences and Parents' Differential Treatment of Siblings: A Multilevel Meta-Analysis	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The current study used meta-analysis to ask whether age differences, sex differences, and family size are linked to differences in parental treatment, as well as whether effect-sizes were moderated by the way parental differential treatment (PDT) was measured, who reported on the PDT, and the domain of PDT. Between August 2015 and November 2020, PsycINFO, Google Scholar, and PubMed Central were searched for articles relating to parental differential treatment; additionally, 13 sibling relationship scholars were contacted to collect unpublished analyses or unused data. Multilevel data came from 13,628 unique participants across 1,388 effect sizes nested within 66 sources (articles/raw data sets), nested within 23 unique samples (74% from North America; 26% from Western Europe). Multilevel meta-analysis conducted in R with the metafor package showed greater differences in parental treatment when siblings were further apart in age or a different sex. The main effects for age spacing, however, were moderated by several factors, particularly the domain of parenting. Specifically, age spacing was linked only to PDT based on control or autonomy granting, meaning when siblings were further apart in age, parents granted more autonomy to one sibling over another. Results were limited, however, by limited sample sizes at the sample level. Overall, findings suggest that parents may, in part, treat siblings differently because they are different to begin with.

DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Many factors at the individual, relationship, family, and community or environmental levels could predict repeat teen pregnancies or births, but research on certain factors is limited. In addition, few studies have examined whether these factors can accurately predict whether teen mothers will have a repeat pregnancy. This study examined theoretically selected predictors of repeat teen pregnancy among 945 pregnant and parenting teens (M age = 17), most of whom were Hispanic/Latina (86%). Logistic regression with 47 predictors measured at baseline was used to predict repeat pregnancy. Predictors were selected based on backward selection that aimed for a balance between model performance and model complexity. A random forest model was also used to determine how accurately repeat pregnancy could be predicted based on all predictors. Significant predictors of repeat pregnancy were the teen mother having a parent with a serious drinking or drug problem when she was a child, being older, not living with a mother figure, not intending to abstain from sex or use a long-acting reversible contraceptive, and having lower resiliency skills. However, predictors explained limited variance in repeat pregnancy, and their accuracy in predicting repeat pregnancy was low. More research is needed to identify accurate predictors of repeat pregnancy because this could inform program providers or developers about areas that warrant more focus in programming for teen parents, and it could help identify teen mothers at higher risk of a repeat pregnancy so they could be the focus of specific programming.

Fathers' and Mothers' Praise and Spatial Language During Play With First Graders: Patterns of Interaction and Relations to Math Achievement	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Parents provide motivational and cognitive support within the same interaction, yet researchers have investigated these separately. We examined two key aspects of parental support, praise (motivational support) and spatial language (cognitive support), from fathers and mothers during three tasks with their first-grade children (6-7-year-olds; N = 107; 56 girls; 72.0% White, 23.4% Black). Parents' praise and spatial language varied by task but not child sex: Both parents produced more praise in the Etch-a-Sketch and block tasks than the card game and produced more spatial language in the Etch-a-Sketch task than other tasks. We further examined whether praise and spatial language in the two spatial tasks (Etch-a-Sketch and block construction) were related to children's later math and spatial skills. We found neither additive nor multiplicative effects of parents' praise or spatial language. We also did not see additive or multiplicative effects of fathers' and mothers' support. However, fathers' greater spatial language at first grade was negatively associated with boys' (but not girls') math achievement in third grade, with greater father spatial tokens related to their sons' lower math achievement. This suggests that boys may perceive fathers' support more negatively than girls do or that fathers may offer additional support for boys with lower abilities. Taken together, this study emphasizes the importance of considering contexts in examining parental support. The correlational nature of the study warrants future research to establish causal relations and to enhance our understanding of multifaceted parent-child interactions.

However, most research assessing social attention relies on static computer-based paradigms, overlooking the dynamics of social interactions and limiting understanding of individual differences in the deployment of naturalistic attention. The current study used mobile eye-tracking to examine relations between social attention, expressed affect, and behavioral inhibition during naturalistic play in young children. Children (N = 28, M-age = 6.12, 46.4% girls, 92.9% White) participated in a 5-min free play with a novel age- and sex-matched peer while mobile eye-tracking data were collected. Interactions were coded for social attention and expressed affect and modeled second-by-second, generating 4,399 observations. Children spent more time dwelling on toys than on peers or anywhere else in the room. Further analyses demonstrated children were almost twice as likely to gaze at their peer when simultaneously self-expressing positive affect. Additionally, children were more than twice as likely and more than three times as likely to self-express positive affect when dwelling on peer or in the presence of peer-expressed positive affect, respectively. Behavioral inhibition was not significantly related to social attention. However, children higher in behavioral inhibition were less likely to self-express positive affect in the presence of peer-expressed positive affect. The current results provide a snapshot of relations between social attention, expressed affect and individual differences during play and provide guidance for future work assessing the roles of social attention and positive affect in facilitating positive social interactions.

It has been shown to be a powerful predictor of many developmental outcomes and to mitigate the impact of risk conditions. However, longitudinal studies on MM reporting changes over time and individual differences among mothers have been scant and quite inconclusive, mainly due to the investigation of changes between only two time points. The current study analyzes MM's developmental trajectories across four time points (3, 6, 9, and 12 months of infants' age) along with the moderating effects of four variables (maternal sensitivity, age, education, and family income). The sample included healthy mother-infant dyads (N = 93, 46 female infants), belonging to monolingual Italian predominantly middle-class families, with 15% (n = 14) classified as low income (below the relative poverty threshold). The dyads were videotaped during semistructured play interactions and transcripts were coded for appropriate mind-related comments (AMRCs) and nonattuned mind-related comments (NAMRCs). Mothers' AMRCs, compared to NAMRCs, showed more temporal stability. Both AMRCs and NAMRCs showed a linear decrease with individual differences across dyads decreasing over time, and dyads becoming increasingly similar one with the other. Low income moderated the normative trend of appropriate mind-related comments. These findings suggest that MM, while depending largely on an individual trait at earlier ages, when infants' mental states are less intelligible, adapts to the increase of infants' sociocommunicative repertoire over time. They also highlight the importance of ecological constraints on the quality of caregiving.

J	Xia, MY				Xia, Mengya			Different Families, Diverse Strengths: Long-Term Implications of Early Childhood Family Processes on Adolescent Positive Functioning	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												With studies primarily focusing on family risk factors on adolescent maladjustment, less is known about positive family processes that facilitate adolescent positive development. This study aimed to identify different configurations of parental involvement and interparental affection during early childhood from a person-centered approach and examine their long-term implications on adolescent positive functioning at age 15. In a sample of 495 2-parent families (53.3% boys; mothers: 42.0% White, 24.7% Black, 27.4% Hispanic, 5.9% other; family income: Median = $42,500), both parents reported interparental affection and their involvement with the child at the child's age 1 and 5, respectively. Adolescents reported their engagement, perseverance, optimism, connectedness, and happiness at age 15. Six profiles of early family processes were identified via the latent profile analysis, including Child-Centered (13.3%; average to high parental involvement and low interparental affection), Distressed Mother (14.5%; low mother involvement and mothers perceiving less affection from fathers), Collaborative (9.9%; relatively more mother involvement with the child and relatively more fathers' affection toward mothers), Cohesive (36.0%; high parental involvement and high interparental affection), Couple-Centered (19.6%; low parental involvement and high interparental affection), and Disengaged (6.7%; low parental involvement and low interparental affection) families. At age 15 (after controlling for family demographics), adolescents in Child-Centered families reported more engagement, adolescents in Cohesive families reported more happiness, adolescents in Cohesive and Collaborative families reported more perseverance and connectedness, and adolescents in Disengaged families reported the lowest optimism. Results highlight that different family configurations during early childhood have differentiated implications on adolescent positive functioning.

Prenatal Programming of Developmental Trajectories for Obesity Risk and Early Pubertal Timing	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The thrifty phenotype and fetal overnutrition hypotheses are two developmental hypotheses that originated from the developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) perspective. The DOHaD posits that exposures experienced prenatally and early in life may influence health outcomes through altering form and function of internal organs related to metabolic processes. Obesity risk and early pubertal timing might be influenced by similar mechanisms. The thrifty phenotype hypothesis is primarily characterized by experiencing a deprivation of nutrients during gestation paired with an energy rich postnatal environment. The fetal overnutrition hypothesis says that obesity experienced prenatally will be associated with increased lifetime risk of obesity in the offspring. Both hypotheses were tested by examining developmental pathways from genetic and prenatal risk through early growth trajectories (birth to 7 years) to pubertal timing at age 11 years. Participants included 361 children adopted at birth (57% male; 57% non-Hispanic White, 11% Black, 9% Hispanic; adoptive family income Mdn = $70,000-$100,000, birth family income Mdn = <$15,000). Associations between boys' childhood body mass index (BMI) and pubertal timing were confounded by genetics, prenatal risk, and early growth. The thrifty phenotype hypothesis was partially supported for boys' childhood BMI (at ages 4 to 7 years). Both hypotheses were partially supported for girls' childhood BMI but not pubertal timing. A novel Gene x Prenatal Risk interaction showed that genetic risk predicted girls' childhood BMI most strongly at adequate compared with at excessive levels of gestational weight gain.

The current study examines the bidirectional links between self-regulation related skills and expressive vocabulary in a longitudinal study during toddlerhood. Participants were 268 toddlers (M-age = 29.6 months, SD = 4.2; 52% boys), mostly of Portuguese nationality, with medium to high sociocultural and economic status, attending private for-profit and nonprofit facilities in Portugal. Self-regulation (executive function and effortful control) and expressive vocabulary were assessed across three assessment waves. Results from cross-lagged panel models suggested bidirectional links between self-regulation and expressive vocabulary across the three assessment waves. These findings add to previous research by taking a first step into establishing the early onset of the intertwined development of these two foundational skills.

J	Swaboda, N; Meder, B; Ruggeri, A				Swaboda, Nora; Meder, Bjoern; Ruggeri, Azzurra			Finding the (Most Efficient) Way Out of a Maze Is Easier Than Asking (Good) Questions	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We investigate whether a spatial representation of a search task supports 4- to 7-year-old children's information-search strategies, relative to their performance in a question-asking game. Children played two computationally and structurally analogous search games: a spatial search task, the maze-exploration game, in which they had to discover the path through a maze by removing masks covering its passages; and a verbal search task, the 20-questions game, where they had to identify a target monster from a set of eight monsters by asking yes-no questions. Across four experiments, we found that children searched more efficiently when they could make queries nonverbally (Experiments 1 and 2a). We also found that merely providing children with a visual conceptual aid that supports their representation of the hypothesis space (Experiment 2b), or familiarizing them with the hypothesis-space structure (Experiment 3) was not sufficient to improve their search strategies. Together, our results suggest that young children's difficulties in the 20-questions game are mainly driven by the verbal requirements of the task. However, they also demonstrate that efficient search strategies emerge much earlier than previously assumed in tasks that do not rely on verbal question generation. These findings highlight the importance of developing age-appropriate paradigms that capture children's early competence, in order to gain a more comprehensive picture of their emerging information-search abilities.

From Integers to Fractions: The Role of Analogy in Developing a Coherent Understanding of Proportional Magnitude	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Children display an early sensitivity to implicit proportions (e.g., 1 of 5 apples vs. 3 of 4 apples), but have considerable difficulty in learning the explicit, symbolic proportions denoted by fractions (e.g., "1/5" vs. "3/4"). Theoretically, reducing the gap between representations of implicit versus explicit proportions would improve understanding of fractions, but little is known about how the representations develop and interact with one another. To address this, we asked 177 third, fourth, and fifth graders (M = 9.85 years, 87 girls, 69% White, 19% low income) to estimate the position of proportionally equivalent integers and fractions on number lines (e.g., 3 on a 0-8 number line vs. 3/8 on a 0-1 number line, Study 1). With increasing age, children's estimates of implicit and explicit proportions became more coherent, such that a child's estimates of fractions on a 0-1 number-line was a linear function of the same child's estimates of equivalent integers. To further investigate whether preexisting integer knowledge can facilitate fraction learning through analogy, we assigned 100 third to fifth graders (M = 10.04 years, 55 girls, 76% White) to an Alignment condition, where children estimated fractions and integers on aligned number lines, or to a No Alignment condition (Study 2). Results showed that aligning integers and fractions on number lines facilitated a better understanding of fractional magnitudes, and increased children's fraction estimation accuracy to the level of college students'. Together, findings suggest that analogies can play an important role in building a coherent understanding of proportions.

Within-Person Reciprocal Associations Between Peer Victimization and Need for Approval	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Prior research links need for approval (NFA; the extent to which self-worth is contingent on peer approval or disapproval) to critical developmental outcomes, but little is known about how NFA develops over time or within social contexts. To address this gap, the present study used a sophisticated analytic approach (autoregressive latent trajectory modeling with standardized residuals) to examine dynamic associations between one salient social experience-peer victimization-and two dimensions of NFA, conceptualized in terms of approach motivation (NFA(approach); enhanced self-worth based on peer approval) and avoidance motivation (NFA(avoid); depleted self-worth based on peer disapproval). Following 636 youth (338 girls; M-age = 7.96 years at Wave 1; 66.7% White; 35.0% subsidized school lunch) from second to seventh grade, analyses revealed that peer victimization predicts subsequent increases in NFA(avoid), which in turn predicts subsequent increases in victimization. Findings also revealed that although mean levels of NFA(avoid) decrease during childhood, increases or decreases in NFA become more entrenched. Thus, childhood peer victimization may disrupt normative decreases in NFA(avoid) and contribute to a cycle in which negative peer judgments increasingly foster low self-worth and further peer difficulties. Preventing this cycle may require encouraging peer-victimized youth to base their self-worth on internal standards rather than peer feedback while helping them develop positive relationships that promote self-worth.

However, it remains unclear whether it can interfere with the process of acquiring social communication skills. Thus, this study sought to experimentally examine whether maternal mobile phone use while interacting with the child has an immediate effect on the frequency of mothers' and infants' joint attention (JA) behaviors, the likelihood that these behaviors will lead to JA episodes, and the duration of established JA episodes. Participants were a community sample of 114 (M-age = 11.36 months; 50% male) Israeli typically developing infants, in which most mothers were highly educated and living in two-parent families. Mother-infant dyads completed a modified still-face paradigm and were randomly assigned to one of three experimental conditions during the still-face phase: (a) mobile phone disruptions, (b) social disruptions, and (c) undisrupted play. Mother-infant interactions were coded for frequency of JA behaviors and duration of JA episodes. In dyads assigned to the mobile phone disruptions condition, infants produced more JA initiations, mothers were less likely to contingently respond to infant initiations, JA behaviors were less likely to result in established JA, and JA episodes were shorter compared to dyads in the two control conditions and the baseline free play phase. Findings suggest that maternal mobile phone use during face-to-face interactions with the infant can disrupt the process of establishing JA in ongoing mother-child interactions.

Most of the research on the architecture of WM is based on adults or older children, but less is known about younger children. In this study, we tested various models of WM on a sample of 739 Italian children, ranging in age from 3 to 8 years, primarily of European heritage and from medium to medium-high socioeconomic background. Participants were assessed with 12 WM tasks, systematically varying the modality and level of executive control required (based on the number of activities to be performed at once: retention alone, ignoring distractors, and dealing with dual tasks). We examined younger children (n = 501, M-age = 56.8 months, SD = 6.4, 48% boys) and older children (n = 238, M-age = 80.0 months, SD = 9.0, 58% boys) separately using multigroup confirmatory factor analyses. A Bayesian analytical approach was adopted. Our results suggested that a four-factor model distinguishing between verbal, visual, spatial-simultaneous, and spatial-sequential components of WM achieved the best fit. Overall, the WM structure was very similar in the two groups. We further explored this result with an additional model with a central executive factor loaded on high-control tasks only and found evidence for the presence of an executive control component. The contribution of this factor in terms of explained variance was only modest, however. Our findings demonstrate that it is important to distinguish between WM components in young children.

Revisiting Age- and Schooling-Related Growth in School Readiness Skills: A Multimethod Validation Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												In the present study, we investigated the relative impact of age- versus schooling-related growth in school readiness skills using four modeling approaches that leverage natural variation in longitudinal data collected within the preschool year. Our goal was to demonstrate the applicability of different analytic techniques that do not rely on assumptions inherent in commonly applied methods (e.g., the school entrance cutoff method, regression discontinuity design) that selection into subsequent grades is based on birthdate alone and that the quality of experiences between grades are not responsible for differences in outcomes. Notably, these alternative methods also do not require data collected across multiple grades. Participants included 316 children (M-age = 54.77 months; 47.15% male) who mostly identified as White (64%) or Latinx (20%). A little over half of the sample attended Head Start preschools (54.75%). Four modeling techniques that leverage data collected at two timepoints in preschool were used to examine schooling effects on children's preliteracy, emergent math, and executive function (EF) skills. Results replicate evidence from previous research using traditional methods. Specifically, findings across all models demonstrate a schooling effect on preliteracy skills during the preschool year, above and beyond maturation, but not on emergent math or EF. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each analytical tool for researchers who are interested in answering questions about the effects of schooling with diverse data collection strategies, as well as broader implications for the integrity of educational and developmental science.

Development of Social Convoys: Trajectories of Convoy Structure and Composition From Childhood Through Adulthood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Personal networks undergo changes in structure and composition throughout the life span, adapting to developmental transitions and changing circumstances in a dynamic way. This study examines stability and change in social convoys from childhood to adulthood and variation in trajectories of convoy characteristics by gender and race. Multilevel models for convoy structure and composition characteristics were estimated using three waves of longitudinal data spanning 23 years. The regionally representative sample included 193 children aged 8 to 12 in Wave 1 (1992) who were surveyed again in their 20s (Wave 2) and 30s (Wave 3). The Wave 1 sample comprised 52% girls, 32% Black children, and 59% White children with average maternal educational attainment of 13 years. Overall, changes in composition, proximity, and contact frequency were observed at each wave. Between Waves 1 and 2, the changes reflect age-normative trends toward network diversification typical of the transition to adulthood, whereas between Waves 2 and 3, the changes were consistent with those expected as young adults settle into stable roles. We also identified convoy characteristics that differed between men and women and between Black and White individuals, emphasizing the importance of considering personal characteristics to fully understand form and function of social relations. Social convoy trajectories early in the life span provide direction for more in-depth examinations of the implications of social ties during these critical life periods.

Developmental Psychology and the Scientific Status of Parental Alienation	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Theory and research have described developmental processes leading to damaged parent-child relationships, such as those that occur during a divorce. However, scholars dispute the scientific status of the literature on children who form unhealthy alliances with one parent against the other-termed parental alienation (PA). This comprehensive literature review tests competing descriptions of the PA literature. Accessing four electronic databases, we identified 213 documents with empirical data on PA published in 10 languages through December 2020. The results confirmed that the current state of PA scholarship meets three criteria of a maturing field of scientific inquiry: an expanding literature, a shift toward quantitative studies, and a growing body of research that tests theory-generated hypotheses. Nearly 40% of the PA literature has been published since 2016, establishing that PA research has moved beyond an early stage of scientific development and has produced a scientifically trustworthy knowledge base. This literature review documents the value of multiple research methodologies to this knowledge base. In addition, the growing body of research described in this review enhances our understanding of the association between interparental conflict and the breakdown of parent-child relationships in families where conflict differentially affects children's relationship with and behavior toward each parent.

This trial included 116 Dutch healthy mothers and their full-term infants. SSC mothers were instructed to provide 1 hr daily of SSC for the first 5 weeks postpartum. Intention-to-treat analyses revealed no group differences in infant crying (i.e., total duration and mean bout length) and sleeping (i.e., total duration and mean bout length). Per-protocol analyses, including only the SSC dyads who adhered to SSC guidelines, indicated that SSC reduced infant total crying duration and the crying bout length. Similarly, dose-response analyses indicated that more SSC minutes were associated with less infant crying (i.e., shorter total duration and bout length) and longer total sleeping duration, especially when the infant was younger. No group differences and associations were found with sleeping bout length. Mother-infant SSC, when performed regularly, may be a cost-effective intervention to reduce infant crying and potentially also extend infant sleep duration.					de Weerth, Carolina/I-7963-2018; de Weerth, Carolina/KTI-0641-2024	de Weerth, Carolina/0000-0002-0921-1811													0012-1649	1939-0599				SEP	2022	58	9					1629	1638		10.1037/dev0001392	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001392		JUN 2022						35653761					WOS:000804361200001

Sorting Out Emotions: How Labels Influence Emotion Categorization	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The ability to categorize emotions has long-term implications for children's social and emotional development. Therefore, identifying factors that influence early emotion categorization is of great importance. Yet, whether and how language impacts emotion category development is still widely debated. The present study aimed to assess how labels influence young children's ability to group faces into emotion categories for both earliest-learned and later-learned emotion categories. Across two studies, 128 two- and 3-year-olds (77 female; Mean age = 3.04 years; 35.9% White, 12.5% Multiple ethnicities or races, 6.3% Asian, 3.1% Black, and 42.2% not reported) were presented with three emotion categories (Study 1 = happy, sad, angry; Study 2 = surprised, disgusted, afraid). Children sorted 30 images of adults posing stereotypical facial expressions into one of the three categories. Children were randomly assigned to either hear the emotion labels before sorting (e.g., "happy faces go here") or were not given labels (e.g., "faces like this go here"). Study 1 results indicated no significant effects of labels for earlier-learned emotion categories, F(1, 60) = .94, p = .337, eta p2 = .013. However, the Study 2 results revealed that labels improved emotion categorization for later-learned categories, F(1, 60) = 8.15, p = .006, eta p2 = .024. Taken together, these results suggest that labels are important for emotion categorization, but the impact of labels may depend on children's familiarity with the emotion category.

J	Wilks, M; Bloom, P				Wilks, Matti; Bloom, Paul			Children Prefer Natural Food, Too	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Adults often prefer things that they believe are natural, including natural foods. This preference has serious implications, such as the rejection of cultured meat and other sustainable technologies. Here we explore whether children also prefer natural foods. We conducted two preregistered studies with 374 adults and children from the United States. In Study 1, children's (N = 120) ages ranged from 6-10 years, with 57% of the sample identifying as female identifying as White/European American, whereas adults (N = 120) had a mean age of 30 years and 4 months, with 48.7% identifying as female, and 69.2% identifying as White/European American. In Study 2, children's (N = 63) aged ranged from 5-7 years, with 57% identifying as female and 66% identifying as White/European American, whereas adults (N = 64) had a mean age of 29 years and 11 months, with 60.7% of the sample identifying as female and 59% of participants identifying as White/European American. We found that, like adults, American children of these ages prefer natural over unnatural foods. This was found across two domains (fruit, juice) and a range of measures (tastiness, safety, unnaturalness, desire to consume). This preference was found in children as young as 5 years of age. Overall, we provide evidence that, at least in the United States, our tendency to prefer natural food is present even in childhood.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				SEP	2022	58	9					1747	1758		10.1037/dev0001387	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001387		JUN 2022						35666929					WOS:000804347600001

Adolescence is marked by increasing agency in decision-making and an accompanying increase in impulsive decisions, suggesting that one characteristic of adolescent decision-making is a tendency to make less-informed decisions. Adolescents could also be especially averse to the effort associated with acquiring relevant information to make decisions. To investigate this possibility, we recruited adolescents (M-age = 15.02 years) in upper-secondary schools and young adults (M-age = 20.53 years) attending university in the Netherlands to complete an effort-based information sampling task, in which participants could sample information until obtaining sufficient evidence to make a decision. Effort costs for sampling were systematically varied. Surprisingly, adolescents sampled more evidence than adults before making decisions when sampling effort costs were low. Further, adolescents obtained stronger evidence prior to their decisions than adults as effort costs increased, exhibiting less aversion to effort costs associated with information sampling. Exploratory computational models supported these findings. Both adolescents and adults used simple heuristics in deciding whether to sample additional information or make a final decision, and adolescents sought a higher evidence threshold before deciding compared with adults. These results suggest that adolescents may require more certainty to make decisions compared with adults and be less averse to effort costs when gathering information to aid decisions.					van den Bos, Wouter/HLP-7749-2023; Kramer, Anne-Wil/AAR-2189-2021; Niebaum, Jesse/AAN-4130-2021	Niebaum, Jesse/0000-0001-6182-8483; Kramer, Anne-Wil/0000-0003-4500-979X													0012-1649	1939-0599				OCT	2022	58	10					1974	1985		10.1037/dev0001397	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001397		JUN 2022						35653763					WOS:000804349300001

Humor With Siblings in Middle Childhood: A Window to Social Understanding?	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Humor is a central feature of close and intimate relationships in childhood. However, fundamental questions regarding the relationship between humor production, pretend play, and social understanding have been overlooked. In a selected subsample from a prospective longitudinal study of first-born children (N = 110, M age = 6.91 years, 46.4% female, 98.1% parents identified as English, Welsh, Scottish, or Irish), we conducted detailed observational coding of children's humor production during dress-up play with younger siblings. Focal children also completed a battery of social understanding tasks that measured emotion understanding and second-order belief understanding. Focal children were also observed during solo free play with Playmobil, and their spontaneous references to others' cognitions and play with objects were coded. Correlation analyses indicated that children's word play with their sibling was associated with their tendency to engage in pretense during solo play. Regression analyses showed that humorous sound play with siblings was associated with their emotion understanding and playful teasing with siblings was associated with their spontaneous references to others' cognitive states during solo free play. Our findings contribute to knowledge and theory regarding domains of development associated with humor production in childhood.

We investigated whether young children use this fact to infer goals from people's actions across two experiments on Canadian 3- to 7-year-old children (N = 316; 167 girls, 149 boys). Participants' demographic information was not formally collected, but the region is predominantly middle-class and White. In Experiment 1, 3-year-old children saw a story where one agent went to a gumball machine with mostly red gumballs and another agent went to a machine with mostly purple ones. When asked which agent wanted a red gumball, children mostly selected the agent who chose the mostly red machine. Moreover, children responded at chance in a control condition where they judged which agent knew they would get a red gumball. In Experiment 2a, 3- to 7-year-old children saw a story where an agent either chose between two gumball machines or two open bowls of gumballs. In both conditions, the agent chose a location with mostly red gumballs over one with mostly blue gumballs but ended up with a blue gumball. Children were more likely to infer the agent had wanted a red gumball when the agent had made a probabilistic choice (machines) than a determinative choice (bowls), though inferences that the red gumball was preferred also increased with age. In Experiment 2b, a preregistered follow-up, American adults responded similarly to the older children. Together our findings suggest that children infer goals by drawing on the understanding that people seek favorable odds, though the clearest findings come from children aged 6 years and older.

Paige			Adolescents Provide More Complex Reasons for Lowering the Voting Age Than Do Adults: Evidence From National Convenience Samples	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Debates about lowering the voting age often center on whether 16- and 17-year-old adolescents possess sufficient cognitive capacity and political knowledge to participate in politics. Little empirical research has examined age differences in adolescents' and adults' complexity of reasoning about political issues. We surveyed adults (n = 778; M-age = 38.5, SD = 12.5; 50% female; 72% non-Hispanic White) and 16- and 17-year-old adolescents (n = 397; 65% female; 69% non-Hispanic White) concerning judgments and justifications about whether the United States should change the minimum voting age. Justifications for changing the voting age were coded for integrative (i.e., integrating multiple perspectives to form a judgment about changing the voting age), elaborative (i.e., providing multiple reasons to support the same judgment about changing the voting age), and dialectical (i.e., recognizing multiple differing perspectives on changing the voting age) complexity of reasoning. Bayesian regressions indicated that adolescents provided greater integrative and elaborative complexity in their reasoning to change the voting age than adults. Adolescents and adults did not meaningfully differ in their dialectical complexity. Findings are consistent with past research indicating that adolescents possess the cognitive capacity and political knowledge to vote in U.S. elections.

H.			How WEIRD Is the Development of Children's Gratitude in the United States? Cross-Cultural Comparisons	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Our interest is in the development of gratitude as a moral virtue, and its variability across different cultural contexts. Given psychology's overreliance on samples collected from the United Sates, Western Europe, and Australasia, we contrasted patterns of age-related expressions of gratitude among a sample of U.S. 7- to 14-year-old children with those from same-age samples from Brazil, China, Russia, South Korea, and Turkey (N = 2,540, 54.7% female, M-age = 10.61 years). The U.S. sample was diverse (n = 730: Black 26.4%, White 40.4%, Latinx 19.9%, Asian 3.8%, Other 1.6%, Missing 7.0%; 55.7% female, M-age = 10.52 years). The remaining samples were largely homogeneous by ethnicity. Our data were gathered using one quantitative scale to measure variations in the extent of gratitude that children expressed, and one qualitative measure to assess variability in the types of gratitude expressed by children of different ages. Both measures were chosen for their fit with the definition of virtuous gratitude. Hypotheses that the U.S. sample would differ from the others in extent and type of gratitude were largely supported. However, age-related differences in the type of gratitude expressed were similar across societies (e.g., in most samples older children were less likely to express concrete gratitude and more likely to express connective gratitude). Our results reveal the importance of treating gratitude as a virtue that develops during childhood and that is influenced by one's cultural group. Reliance on samples from a limited set of cultures is thus to be avoided.

Connecting Symbolic Fractions to Their Underlying Proportions Using Iterative Partitioning	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Fractions are a challenging mathematics topic for many elementary and middle school students, and even for adults. However, a growing body of developmental research suggests that young children can reason about visually presented proportions, well before fraction instruction, providing insight into how fractions might be introduced to improve learning. We designed a card game to teach first and second grade children (N = 195, including a racially and economically diverse sample from the United States) about fractions in one of three ways. In the Actively Divided condition we iteratively divided an area model into equal-sized units, in the Predivided condition we used an area model with the end-state of the Actively Divided condition, and in the Nondivided condition we used a continuous representation of the fraction magnitude that was not divided into unit-sized parts. Children in the actively divided condition demonstrated larger improvements matching symbolic fractions and visual fractions (i.e., pie charts) than children in the other two conditions. Posthoc analyses of children's gameplay revealed that the actively divided condition may have provided a more optimal level of difficulty for young children than the predivided condition, which was particularly difficult, and the nondivided condition, which was trivially easy. These differences in gameplay performance provide insights into possible mechanisms for our results. We discuss open research questions highlighted by this work and implications of these findings for both the development of proportional reasoning and fraction learning.

SI is associated with psychopathology that arises in young adulthood, such as anxiety. We aim for a better insight into the genetic and environmental contributions to SI across the life span, and as such examine their contributions to SI stability and change across adolescent and adult life span. We analyzed cohort-sequential longitudinal data from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR), spanning a period of 25 years (Men (N, %): 17855, 37.4%; Age (Median, IQR): 19 years, 16-26 years; 7474 complete MZ twins and 8799 complete DZ twins). The data were organized into 7 age groups: <14 (preadolescence), 15-16 (early adolescence), 17-18 (mid adolescence), 19-20 (late adolescence), 21-30 (young adulthood), 31-40 (adulthood), 41+ (middle-age-older adulthood). SI was assessed with the ASEBA-based proxy questionnaire. Phenotypic stability was established across the entire age range. Next, a longitudinal genetic simplex model was fitted to estimate the genetic and environmental contributions to the observed phenotypic stability. Results showed SI correlated well across follow-up of a single decade (.44 <= r <= .59) and moderately across the 25 years (.23 - .32) from adolescence to middle-age and older. Broad-sense heritability (h(2)) was between 40 and 48% across the 7 age groups. Additive and nonadditive genetic effects together explained most of the stability of SI across the life span (about 60-90% of the phenotypic correlation between ages), whereas environmental effects played a lesser role (about 10-40%). Concluding, SI, known to increase the risk of internalizing psychopathology, is phenotypically stable across the life span, which is largely attributable to genetic contributions to individual differences in SI.

Evidence From Individual- and Classroom-Level Survey and Observational Data	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The sustaining environments hypothesis theorizes that the lasting effects of PreK programs are contingent on the quality of the subsequent learning environment in early elementary school. The current study tests this theory by leveraging data from students (N = 462) who did and did not enroll in the Boston Public Schools (BPS) prekindergarten (PreK) program as well as features of their kindergarten instruction measured at the child- and classroom-levels using surveys and observations. Taken together, findings revealed limited evidence for the sustaining environments hypothesis. The bulk of the results were null, indicating that in general, associations between enrollment in BPS PreK and language, literacy, and math skills through the spring of kindergarten did not vary by kindergarten instructional experiences. When examining distinct types of instructional experiences, there were some inklings that child-level observational measures of kindergarten learning experiences-particularly those capturing constrained versus unconstrained instruction-were more predictive of PreK persistence than observed global classroom quality measures or survey-based measures of advanced instruction. However, these associations were not always specific to outcomes matching the content delivered during this instruction (math vs. literacy), consistent with the possibility of either cross-domain effects or that instructional variables are proxies for more general instructional practices. Findings for future research and theory are discussed.

J	Marshall, J; Gollwitzer, A; Bloom, P				Marshall, Julia; Gollwitzer, Anton; Bloom, Paul			Why Do Children and Adults Think Other People Punish?	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Past research has demonstrated that both consequentialist motives (such as deterrence) and deontological motives (such as "just deserts") underlie children's and adults' punitive behavior. But what motives do we ascribe to others who pursue punishment? The present work explores this question by assessing which punitive motives children (6- and 7-year-olds, n = 100; 67% White; 55% female) and adults (n = 100; 76% White; 35% female) attribute to individuals who witnessed and punished a transgression (third-party punishment). Beyond this, we varied the social role of the punisher (a teacher, an adult visiting a school, a fellow peer) to examine whether motivational ascriptions vary depending on social context. Across these contexts, children endorsed a variety of punishment motives but consistently rejected the notion that individuals punish for the purpose of inflicting suffering. Adults-like children-prioritized consequentialist motives but, in more personal contexts (involving a child punishing their peer), considered "just deserts" a more plausible motive. These findings speak to developmental and contextual variation in individuals' theories about punitive motives and provide insight into how individuals understand and respond to punishment in everyday life.

Yet, very few studies have examined the antecedents of individual differences in such developments, and most have used parental reports of child sleep. This study aimed to investigate the roles of mutual responsiveness in mother-child interactions and child temperamental anger proneness in the prediction of changes in sleep during the preschool period. The sample was comprised of 94 children (44 girls, 50 boys) of mostly White (93%) and college-educated (85%) mothers. Mother-child mutual responsiveness and child anger proneness were assessed at 2 years, and sleep was assessed using actigraphy at the ages of 2, 3, and 4 years. Multilevel growth models revealed that higher temperamental anger proneness was concurrently associated with lower sleep efficiency and shorter nighttime sleep duration at 2 years. In regard to changes in sleep, nighttime sleep duration decreased between 2 and 4 years among children exposed to lower mutual responsiveness in interactions with their mothers. High anger proneness was related to an increase in sleep efficiency from 2 to 4 years, whereas low anger proneness was associated with a decrease in nighttime duration during the same period. No interactive effect was found between anger proneness and mother-child mutual responsiveness. These results suggest that mother-child relationships and child temperament may play different roles, not only in children's concurrent sleep patterns but also in changes in sleep across the preschool period.

Children Expect Others to Prefer Handmade Items	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Although children frequently engage in creative activities (in which they make foods and objects by hand), the development and scope of children's thinking about handmade items is largely unexplored. In the present studies, we examined whether 4- to 12-year-old children at a local children's museum (54% girls, 46% boys; 51% White, 11% Asian/Asian American, 10% more than 1 group, 4% Latinx, 3% Black/African American, 18% did not report race/ethnicity) would expect other people to prefer handmade over factory-made items, including foods and nonfoods. In Experiments 1 (n = 124) and 2 (n = 122), participants expected a child character to prefer items the character made themselves and items made by the character's parent or a local person. However, this expectation did not persist at all costs: When considering imperfect handmade items in Experiment 3 (n = 122), children demonstrated a handmade preference when considering nonfoods made by a parent but demonstrated a factory-made preference when considering foods made by a parent. Children's explanations were associated with their choices: When children's explanations referred to emotions or relationships, they were more likely to select handmade items. When children referred to item features, they were more likely to select factory-made items. Across studies, we observed persistent age and gender effects: Children's handmade preference increased with child age and girls demonstrated a more robust handmade preference than boys. These findings highlight children's developing and nuanced reasoning about object value. At an early age, children consider who made an object as a contributor to its value.

This study examined whether children's attention to two types of competing cues during hypothetical transgressions related to their subsequent emotions. Eye tracking was used to test whether attending to other-oriented cues (i.e., a victim's face) versus self-serving cues (e.g., a stolen good) related to kind and selfish emotions. Participants were 4-, 6-, and 8-year-olds (N = 224; M-age = 6.85 years; 51% girls), whose first language was primarily English (80%), and whose primary caregivers mainly reported backgrounds from Asia (40%) or Europe (39%). Overall, almost all children spend more time attending to selfish than other-oriented cues. Latent difference score modeling revealed that higher scores on attentional orientation (i.e., more other-oriented attention compared with self-serving attention or smaller gaps between the two) was significantly related to more kind, but not selfish emotions. This relation remained across age groups. Furthermore, with age, children attended somewhat less to self-serving cues. These findings highlight attention's importance in developing kind emotions.

Tulsa SEED Study Team	When Does 1+1 Not Equal 2? The Relative Advantage of Public School-Based Pre-K Versus Head Start for Low-Income Children's Kindergarten Cognitive and Self-Regulatory Skills	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Decades of research suggest that both Head Start and public pre-kindergarten (pre-k) programs boost low-income preschoolers' kindergarten skills. What is not yet well understood is whether there are relative advantages of transitioning from Head Start after 1 year into a school-based public pre-k program for the year immediately before kindergarten for children's developing cognitive and self-regulation skills. This is an important question, because in many communities Head Start and school-based pre-k programs provide competing early education options for low-income 4-year-olds, leaving policymakers, educators, and parents wondering which pathway best promotes the mix of skills predictive of success in elementary school. Only one study-conducted prior to significant recent demographic and policy changes affecting early education and focused exclusively on cognitive outcomes-has addressed this question. We extend that work with contemporary data on 362 low-income children to assess the relative advantages for both kindergarten cognitive and self-regulatory skills of 2 years of Head Start before kindergarten versus transitioning from Head Start to school-based pre-k at age 4. The child sample was evenly split by gender and diverse in race/ethnicity (50% Hispanic/Latinx; 36% Black; 7% White). Results showed that children who transitioned after 1 year of Head Start to school-based pre-k at age 4 showed marginally higher kindergarten literacy (d = .13) and significantly greater math (d = .18) skills than children who remained in Head Start for a second year, but there were no significant differences in kindergarten self-regulatory skills. Implications for contemporary, pressing policy issues are discussed.					; Castle, Sherri/L-2240-2016	Schochet, Owen/0000-0001-6712-2705; Castle, Sherri/0000-0001-7906-897X; Horm, Diane M./0000-0002-1836-5329; Martin, Anne/0000-0001-9392-4234; Johnson, Anna/0000-0002-9832-6724													0012-1649	1939-0599				MAY	2022	58	5					848	865		10.1037/dev0001335	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001335								35482675					WOS:000787980100007

As the pandemic has persisted, many children remain in remote schooling and those attending in-person childcare or school have contended with unpredictable closures. This study investigated the frequency and consequences of disruptions to children's childcare and school arrangements during Fall 2020. The sample is parents who were hourly service-sector workers prior to the pandemic, had a young child between the ages of 3 and 8, and were at least partially responsible for their children's school and/or care in Fall 2020 (N = 676); half of the sample were non-Hispanic Black, 22% were Hispanic, and 18% are non-Hispanic White. Parents were asked to complete 30 days of daily surveys about whether their care and school arrangements went smoothly and as predicted that day, about their mood, parenting behaviors, and children's behavior. Results showed that daily disruptions to care and school were common, with families reporting a disruption on 24% of days. Families with children in exclusively remote schooling experienced more frequent disruption than families with children in in-person care or school. For all families, care or school disruptions were related to worse child behavior, more negative parental mood, and increased likelihood of losing temper and punishment. Within-family mediation suggests that parents' difficulties supporting children's learning, and to a lesser degree their mood and parenting behaviors, partially mediate effects of disruptions on child behavior.

Harrington			Profiles of Future Expectations Among Urban Adolescents in Cambodia	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Adolescents are tasked with navigating competing priorities, including whether to many, have children. pursue a job/career, go to college, and contribute to society. The developmental task of building expectations for the future is especially complex for Cambodian adolescents living within a society that strongly prioritizes family obligations yet increasingly provides educational and professional opportunities. The current study, guided by Seginer's (2003) future orientation model. applied latent profile analysis (LPA) to explore patterns of Cambodian adolescents' (N = 580.64% female. M-age = 15.85) future expectations across key life domains and predictors of those patterns. LPA identified four profiles: Low Expectancy (low expectations across all domains; 12%), Family Focused (high expectations to get married and have children; 31%), Professional/Service Focused (high expectations across education. employment, and societal contribution domains: 27%), and High Expectancy (high expectations across all domains: 30%). Females were more likely than males to be in the Professional/Service Focused than High Expectancy profile. Adolescents with greater internal locus of control and family obligation were less likely to be in the Low Expectancy and Family Focused than High Expectancy profile, whereas adolescents in higher grade levels were more likely to be in the Family Focused than High Expectancy profile. Adolescents with closer relationships with mothers were less likely to be in the Professional/Service Focused than High Expectancy profile; adolescents with closer relationships with fathers were more likely to be in the Professional/Service Focused than High and Low Expectancy profiles. Findings elucidate configurations of adolescents' future expectations, and factors distinguishing among adolescents with different configurations.

The present study was designed to gain a better understanding as to how adolescents' perceptions of parenting evolves across a major educational transition and how the parenting perceived across this transition may facilitate adolescents' psychosocial adjustment and identity formation. Swiss adolescents (N = 483, M-age = 14.96 years old; 64.6% female) in their last year of mandatory secondary school completed self-report measures at two semiannual time points both prior to and following their educational transition. Adolescents reported on their perceptions of their parents' autonomy support and psychological control as well as their self-esteem, risk-taking behaviors, and identity processes. Group-based trajectory analyses identified three parenting trajectory classes (i.e., Highly Supportive Parenting, Decreasing Supportive Parenting, Stable Controlling Parenting), three psychosocial adjustment trajectory classes (i.e., Low Self-Esteem/Low Risk-Taking, High Self-Esteem/Low Risk-Taking, Moderate Self-Esteem/Increasing Risk-Taking), and four identity trajectory classes (i.e., Lost Searchers, Guardians, Pathmakers, Successful Searchers). These solutions support the contention that adolescents are likely to experience academic transitions differently, whether in terms of their parent-adolescent relationship, their psychosocial adjustment, or their identity. Furthermore, parenting trajectory classes were associated with specific identity and psychosocial adjustment classes. Notably, Highly Supportive Parenting was associated with the High Self-Esteem/Low Risk-Taking class and the Pathmaker identity class, whereas Stable Controlling Parenting was most strongly associated with the Low Self-Esteem/Low Risk-Taking class and the Lost Searcher identity class. These findings highlight the importance of autonomy supportive parenting for adolescent development during educational transitions.

Drawing on this model, the present study used three-wave longitudinal data to examine patterns of the success and lack of success in the resolution of Eriksonian crisis in relation to romantic loneliness as a negative outcome of the intimacy crisis, and compared across Poland and the United States. The data were collected from Polish and U.S. individuals aged 18-40 for Wave 1 (N = 763). Four patterns of the Eriksonian intimacy crisis were identified: (a) stable partnered status; (b) stable single status; (c) transition from single to partnered status; (d) transition from partnered to single status. In both countries, transition from single to partnered status was related to decreased romantic loneliness. Greater initial romantic loneliness was observed among Polish single adults who transited to partnered status in contrast to stable single adults. In turn, the U.S. partnered adults who transited to single status initially experienced lower romantic loneliness than stable single adults. Bivariate latent growth curve models pairing romantic loneliness with relationship satisfaction revealed that higher initial relationship satisfaction was associated with lower initial romantic loneliness, and a greater increase in relationship satisfaction was associated with smaller increases in romantic loneliness. The findings highlight that different resolutions of the intimacy crisis are related to diverse romantic loneliness and relationship satisfaction trajectories and these associations also appear to differ as a function of various marital and loneliness contexts in Poland and the United States.

This outcome led to the view that bilingualism was a positive experience. However, subsequent research abandoned intelligence tests as the assessment tool and evaluated performance on cognitive tasks, making the research after Peal and Lambert qualitatively different from that before their landmark study, creating a disconnect between the new and earlier research. These newer cognitive studies showed both positive effects of bilingualism and no differences between language groups. But why were Peal and Lambert's results so different from previous studies that were also based on intelligence tests? The present study analyzed data from verbal and nonverbal intelligence tests that were collected from 6,077 participants across 79 studies in which intelligence tests were administered as background measures to various cognitive tasks. By including adults, the study extends the results across the life span. On standardized verbal tests, monolinguals outperformed bilinguals, but on nonverbal measures of intelligence, there were no differences between language groups. These results, which are different from those reported by Peal and Lambert, are used to reinterpret their findings in terms of the sociolinguistic, political, and cultural context in which the Peal and Lambert study was conducted and the relevance of those factors for all developmental research.

The Cognitive Costs and Advantages of Children's Exposure to Parental Relationship Instability: Testing an Evolutionary-Developmental Hypothesis	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Guided by evolutionary-developmental models, this study tested the hypothesis that children's exposure to parental relationship instability, defined by initiation and dissolution of caregiver intimate relationships, has both costs in cognitive impairments and benefits in enhanced learning skills. Participants included 243 mothers and their preschool children (M age 4.60 years; 56% girls) from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds (e.g., 46% Black; 19% Latinx). Consistent with hypotheses, higher levels of parental relationship instability during preschool predicted children's poorer performance on explicit, higher-order cognitive functioning tasks (e.g., IQ, working memory) and better performance in detecting reward probabilities in an implicit learning task 2 years later. Results of the piecewise latent growth curve analysis of the implicit learning task revealed that children experiencing greater family instability were able to more rapidly identify the locations of the hidden rewards in the early, rather than later, stages of the games. Additional findings supported the role of children's antagonistic representations of family relationships as an intermediary mechanism. More specifically, parental relationship instability significantly predicted higher levels of children's antagonistic representations of their families 2 years later after controlling for their earlier antagonistic representations and demographic covariates. Children's antagonistic representations, in turn, were concurrently linked with poorer explicit cognitive functioning and better implicit learning abilities when they were in first grade. The findings inform an understanding of cognitive tradeoffs of experiencing parental relationship instability and may have important implications for modifying educational and clinical programs to capitalize on the cognitive strengths of children who experience environmental unpredictability.

J	Jansen, M; Boda, Z; Lorenz, G				Jansen, Malte; Boda, Zsofia; Lorenz, Georg			Social Comparison Effects on Academic Self-Concepts-Which Peers Matter Most?	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Social comparisons with peers are important sources of self-development during adolescence. Many previous studies showed that students' academic self-concepts (ASC) form by contrasting one's own achievement with the average of one's class or school (the Big-Fish-Little-Pond Effect [BFLPE]). Based on social comparison theory, however, we would expect some peers to be more likely social comparison targets than other peers, for example, because they are more visible or students perceive them as similar to themselves. In this study, we used sociometric data to analyze which peers play the most important role for social comparison effects on ASC. We examined how the average achievement of friends, study partners, peers perceived as popular by the student, as well as same-gender and same-ethnic peers affect the general ASC and how these effects compare to the effect of the classroom's average achievement. The study was based on a German longitudinal sample of 2,438 students (44% no recent immigrant background, 19% Turkish immigrant background, 10% Eastern European immigrant background, 27% other immigrant background) from 117 school classes that were followed from grade 9 to 10. Results from longitudinal social network analysis do not confirm substantial incremental effects of specific types of peers, while class average achievement showed a stable negative effect (confirming the BFLPE). In addition, we could provide evidence for social selection effects based on ASC. We conclude that classrooms provide a specific setting that imposes social comparisons with the "generalized peer" rather than with specific subgroups of peers.

J	Wang, MM; Cardarelli, A; Leslie, SJ; Rhodes, M				Wang, Michelle M.; Cardarelli, Amanda; Leslie, Sarah-Jane; Rhodes, Marjorie			How Children's Media and Teachers Communicate Exclusive and Essentialist Views of Science and Scientists	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Language that uses noun labels and generic descriptions to discuss people who do science (e.g., "Let's be scientists! Scientists discover new things") signals to children that "scientists" is a distinctive category. This identity-focused language promotes essentialist beliefs and leads to disengagement from science among young children in experimental contexts. The extent to which these cues shape the development of children's beliefs and behaviors in daily life, however, depends on (a) the availability of identity-focused language in children's environments and (b) the power of these cues to shape beliefs over time, even in the noisier, more variable contexts in which children are exposed to them. Documenting the availability of this language, linguistic coding of children's media (Study 1) and prekindergarten teachers' language from one science lesson (Study 2; n = 103; 98 female, one male, four unknown; 66% White, 8% African American, 6% Asian/Asian American, 3% mixed/biracial; 21% of the sample, of any race, identified as Hispanic/Latinx) confirmed that identity-focused language was the most common form of science language in these two samples. Further, children (Study 3; n = 83; M-age = 4.36 years; 43 female, 40 male; 64% White, 12% Asian/Asian American, 24% mixed/biracial; 36% of the sample, of any race, identified as Hispanic/Latinx) who were exposed to lower proportions of identity-focused language from their teachers developed increasingly inclusive science beliefs and greater science engagement over time. These findings suggest that linguistic input is an important mechanism through which exclusive beliefs about science are conveyed to children in daily life.

J	Butti, N; Finisguerra, A; Urgesi, C				Butti, Niccolo; Finisguerra, Alessandra; Urgesi, Cosimo			Holistic Processing of Body Stimuli: Evidence of Body Composite Illusion in Adults and Children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												There is inconsistent evidence that human bodies are processed through holistic processing as it has been widely reported for faces. To assess how configural and holistic processes may develop with age, we administered a visual body recognition task assessing the presence of body inversion and composite illusion effects to white adults (114 participants, 77 women, aged between 18 and 35 years) and children (138 participants, 74 girls, aged between 6 and 11 years). Furthermore, to verify the presence of an own-age bias in body processing, we presented either child or adult bodies to both age groups. Adults and children showed reliable and comparable body inversion and composite illusion effects, confirming the use of configural and holistic body processing. Cross-sectional analysis showed that these perceptual strategies were already reliable in children aged 6-7 years and did not encounter significant changes across childhood. Although we found reliable body inversion and composite illusion effects for both own- and different-age bodies, results pointed to greater composite illusion effects for own-age bodies. This may suggest that sharing similar body structures might facilitate the holistic processing of others' bodies. These findings provide new insights into the development of body-specific perceptual processes and may have theoretical and clinical implications for the evaluation and treatment of body perception disorders in childhood.

J	Peterson, CC; Wellman, HM				Peterson, Candida C.; Wellman, Henry M.			Altruism, Hypocrisy and Theory of Mind in Autistic and Nonautistic Children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Children make choices between generosity and greed every day. Often they must also choose between confession or denial of antisocial acts like greed, thereby displaying either honesty or hypocrisy. Such choices pose cognitive challenges that, in theory, might reflect children's developing social-cognitions and affect their daily social lives and developmental opportunities. Individual differences in altruism and hypocrisy were examined in relation to theory of mind (ToM) in 102 school-age children (44 autistic; 58 typically developing) using ecologically valid altruism and hypocrisy tests where generosity had lasting real-life costs and hypocrisy was self-serving. Selfless altruism was abundant for autistic and nonautistic children alike and was significantly predicted by ToM over and above other predictors like age, gender, and language. More nonautistic (74%) than autistic children (41%) displayed hypocrisy, although individual ToM differences among ASD children were not significantly correlated with it. Findings extend to new instances (altruism and hypocrisy) evidence of ToM's importance for everyday social behaviors that impact upon peer relations while also extending past evidence that: (a) unexpected sociomoral strengths can coexist with ToM delays, (b) attention to individual differences is crucial, and (c) autistic children's capacity to develop sociomoral reasoning should not be underestimated.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				JUL	2022	58	7					1331	1344		10.1037/dev0000942	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000942		APR 2022						35446073					WOS:000783959000001

Contextual Variation in Language Input to Children: A Naturalistic Approach	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Children learn what words mean from hearing words used across a variety of contexts. Understanding how different contextual distributions relate to the words young children say is critical because context robustly affects basic learning and memory processes. This study examined children's everyday experiences using naturalistic video recordings to examine two contextual factors-where words are spoken and who speaks the words-through analyzing the nouns in language input and children's own language productions. The families in the study (n = 8) were two-parent, dual-income, middle-class families with a child between 1 year, 3 months to 4 years, 4 months (age M = 3 years, 5 months) and at least one additional sibling. The families were filmed as they interacted in their homes and communities over 2 weekdays and 2 weekend days. From these videos, we identified when the focal child was exposed to language input and randomly selected 9 hr of contiguous speech segments per family to obtain 6,129 noun types and 30,257 noun tokens in language input and 1,072 noun types and 5,360 noun tokens in children's speech. We examined whether the words that children heard in more variable spatial and speaker contexts were produced with greater frequency by children. The results suggest that both the number of places and the number of speakers that characterized a child's exposure to a noun were positively associated with the child's production of that noun, independent of how frequently the word was spoken.

However, little research has been conducted on within-person changes of prosocial behavior and behavioral problems over time. With random-intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs), the current study analyzed longitudinal associations between prosocial behavior and behavioral problems in two twin cohorts (98% Western European): in early childhood (age M = 4.77, SD = .58, 52% girls, N = 440) and middle childhood (age M = 7.94, SD = .67, 51% girls, N = 512). To obtain robust results, two parental reported questionnaires and an observational task were used as prosocial behavior assessments. In line with the literature, we found a significant between-person association between externalizing behavior and parent reported prosocial behavior in middle childhood, but not in early childhood. Some evidence indicated that changes in externalizing problems affect later prosocial behavior in middle childhood. Overall, however, the RI-CLPMs provided most support for the hypothesis that within-person changes in prosocial behavior are not related to within-person changes in behavioral problems. Thus, our findings did not support the hypothesis that increased prosocial behavior directly results in decreased behavioral problems, but emphasizes the need to take into account the multifaceted nature of prosocial behavior.

However, the empirical evidence supporting this claim is inconsistent. In the current study, we examined the longitudinal data from a sample of Swedish infants (6, 10, and 18 months, n = 118, 59 boys) across a broad set of eye-tracking tasks to find stable markers of attention. Two attention indices showed a high degree of stability and internal consistency but were not related to self-regulatory functions measures at 18 or 30 months. Our findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that a relation between attentional control and self-regulation is unsupported. We discuss the need for a revision of the idea of attention as foundational for self-regulation.

Tiny Dancers: Effects of Musical Familiarity and Tempo on Children's Free Dancing	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Around the world, musical engagement frequently involves movement. Most adults easily clap or sway to a wide range of tempos, even without formal musical training. The link between movement and music emerges early-young infants move more rhythmically to music than speech, but do not reliably align their movements to the beat. Laboratory work encouraging specific motor patterns (e.g., drumming, tapping) demonstrates that toddlers and young children's movements are affected by music in a rudimentary way, such that they move faster to faster rhythms (tempo flexibility). In the present study, we developed and implemented a novel home recording method to investigate how musical familiarity and tempo affect children's naturalistic free-dance movements. Caregivers made home recordings of their children's responses to an experimenter-created playlist (N = 83, age range = 1.25 to 3.91 years, M-age = 2.39 years, SD = .74 years; 41 girls, 42 boys; 75% of household incomes > $90 000 CAD). Children listened to 1-min excerpts of their favorite music and unfamiliar, genre-matched music, each played at 90, 120, and 150 bpm (pitch constant; order randomized). Children moved faster to faster music and demonstrated tempo flexibility for both favorite and unfamiliar music. Favorite music encouraged more smiling across tempo conditions than unfamiliar music, as well as more dancing in the slowest tempo condition. Results demonstrate that young children's self-selected movements are affected by musical tempo and familiarity. We also demonstrate the usefulness of a naturalistic home recording method for assessing early auditory-motor integration.

In the present study, we examined whether decision-making varies as a function of socioeconomic status (SES) using the Children's Gambling task (CGT). We administered the CGT to 227 children (49% female, 48% low SES) between the ages of 5 and 7 years. After completing the CGT, we assessed children's knowledge of the reward/loss contingencies. Data analysis was conducted through multilevel modeling. Fluid intelligence, as measured by the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence, was included as a covariate in the analysis. Overall performance differed between SES groups. Children from middle/high-SES backgrounds learned to choose more from the deck with higher future reward. In contrast, children in the low-SES group did not act in a full future-oriented manner. No differences were found in the level of explicit understanding of the task reached by the two SES groups. Whereas middle/high-SES children with higher knowledge of the game performed better on the last blocks of the task in comparison with their same-SES peers with no understanding, low-SES children with higher explicit knowledge did not exhibit an improvement in their decision-making strategy in comparison with their same-SES low-awareness counterparts. Fluid intelligence did not predict CGT performance, suggesting that SES differences were not mediated by reasoning capabilities. The finding that children from low-SES families continued exhibiting an immediate reward-oriented strategy despite being aware of deck contingencies fits with (although speculatively) the evolutionary-developmental framework.

Intersensory Matching of Faces and Voices in Infancy Predicts Language Outcomes in Young Children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Parent language input is a well-established predictor of child language development. Multisensory attention skills (MASks; intersensory matching, shifting and sustaining attention to audiovisual speech) are also known to be foundations for language development. However, due to a lack of appropriate measures, individual differences in these skills have received little research focus. A newly established measure, the Multisensory Attention Assessment Protocol (MAAP), allows researchers to examine predictive relations between early MASks and later outcomes. We hypothesized that, along with parent language input, multisensory attention to social events (faces and voices) in infancy would predict later language outcomes. We collected data from 97 children (predominantly White and Hispanic, 48 males) participating in an ongoing longitudinal study assessing 12-, 18-, and 24-month MASks (MAAP) and parent language input (quality, quantity), and 18- and 24-month language outcomes (child speech production, vocabulary size). Results revealed 12-month intersensory matching (but not maintaining or shifting attention) of faces and voices in the presence of a distractor was a strong predictor of language. It predicted a variety of 18- and 24-month child language outcomes (expressive vocabulary, child speech production), even when holding traditional predictors constant: parent language input and SES (maternal education: 52% bachelor's degree or higher). Further, at each age, parent language input predicted just one outcome, expressive vocabulary, and SES predicted child speech production. These novel findings reveal infant intersensory matching of faces and voices in the presence of a distractor can predict which children might benefit most from parent language input and show better language outcomes.

This study examines the relations among cumulative risk, EF, and learning outcomes measured 2-years later in Ghanaian third- and fourth-graders (N = 371; 49% female), shedding light on underlying mechanisms of how risk can undermine learning. A cumulative risk index was created based on a set of four child-reported risk factors: home aggression, unsafe home neighborhood, hunger, and having worked for pay. Cumulative risk and EF were negatively correlated. Learning outcomes (literacy and math test scores) were negatively correlated with earlier measures of cumulative risk and positively correlated with earlier measures of EF. EF mediated the association between cumulative risk and later learning outcomes, accounting for 65.3% of the total effect for literacy and 100% for math. This mediated pathway was robust to controls for child and household sociodemographic characteristics. The findings contribute to a small evidence base on the mediating role of EF in linking adversity and learning outcomes in a global context.

Working Memory Capacity Development Through Childhood: A Longitudinal Analysis	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Working memory is an often studied and important psychological construct. The growth of working memory capacity (WMC) in childhood is described as linear. Average adult WMC is estimated as either four or five "chunks." Using latent curve models of data from a measure of digit span backward that was administered longitudinally to a large sample representative of the native-English-speaking U.S. kindergarten population in 2011, we found that WMC growth in childhood is curvilinear. It shows an increasing yet decelerating pattern. Scoring rules (e.g., requiring 50% or 75% of trials correct) influence age-based estimates, but WMCs have likely been underestimated in children, and the average adult WMC of five is more plausible than four, as measured by digit span backward. Developmental WMC estimates, such as those reported in this research, may help others develop prescriptive learning interventions for children and understand its growth and decline across the life span.

Attention was measured at 10 months using a dynamic puppet task and receptive vocabulary was measured at 3-, 4-, 6-, and 9 years of age using the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test. The best-fitting multilevel growth model was a quadratic model as a function of age. Results indicated that both infant attention and maternal education were predictors of receptive vocabulary initial status, with no differences as a function of child sex. In contrast, infant attention, but not maternal education, predicted growth in receptive language skill, and boys demonstrated a faster rate of receptive language development in comparison to girls. These findings illustrate that even after accounting for child sex and maternal education, infant visual attention predicts children's receptive language development starting from the early preschool period into the elementary school years. These findings demonstrate the importance and nature of the role that infant attention and maternal education play with respect to childhood receptive language development.

Retaliatory Attitudes as Mediator of Exposure to Violence and Firearm Aggression Among Youth: The Protective Role of Organized Activity Involvement	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Firearm injury is a significant public health concern among youth living in the United States. Youth with exposure to violence (ETV) are more susceptible to carrying and using a firearm. Few researchers, however, have examined psychological mechanisms undergirding the association between ETV and firearm aggression. Retaliatory attitudes have been discussed as a potential mediator linking ETV with firearm aggression. Moreover, organized activity participation may disrupt direct and indirect pathways connecting ETV to firearm aggression. We tested: (a) the mediating role of retaliatory attitudes in the ETV-firearm aggression link, and (b) the moderating role of organized activity participation among 570 youth with past year illicit drug use and seeking emerging department care in an urban emergency department (ages 14-24; 58.8% males). Using multigroup path analysis, ETV indirectly influenced firearm aggression through retaliatory attitudes for youth not involved organized activities. Organized activities also buffered the association between retaliatory attitudes (mediator) and firearm aggression (outcome). Organized activities may, therefore, prevent firearm aggression by reducing retaliatory attitudes among youth contending with ETV.

J	Yucel, M; Drell, MB; Jaswal, VK; Vaish, A				Yucel, Meltem; Drell, Marissa B.; Jaswal, Vikram K.; Vaish, Amrisha			Young Children Do Not Perceive Distributional Fairness as a Moral Norm	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Young children robustly distinguish between moral norms and conventional norms (Smetana, 1984: Yucel et al., 2020). In existing research, norms about the fair distribution of resources are by definition considered part of the moral domain; they are not distinguished from other moral norms such as those involving physical harm. Yet an understanding of fairness in resource distribution (hereafter, "fairness") emerges late in development and is culturally variable, raising the possibility that fairness may not fall squarely in the moral domain. In 2 preregistered studies, we examined whether U.S. American children who were primarily White see fairness as a moral or conventional norm. In study 1 (N = 96). we did not obtain the established moral-conventional difference needed to investigate questions about the status of fairness. We improved our design in our second preregistered study. In study 2 (N = 94), 4-year-olds rated moral transgressions (e.g.. hitting) as more serious than fairness and conventional transgressions (e.g., wearing pajamas to school), but importantly, they rated fairness and conventional transgressions as similarly serious. In contrast, 6- and 8-year-olds rated moral transgressions as more serious than fairness and conventional transgressions, and fairness as more serious than conventional transgressions. An additional. forced-choice procedure revealed that most 6-year-olds also categorized fairness with moral rather than conventional transgressions: 4- and 8-year-olds' responses on this measure did not show systematic patterns. U.S. American children may not equate norms of fairness in resource distribution with harm-based moral norms, even into middle childhood.					; Yucel, Meltem/S-2689-2019	Jaswal, Vikram/0000-0002-7667-1252; Yucel, Meltem/0000-0002-7274-5971													0012-1649	1939-0599				JUN	2022	58	6					1103	1113		10.1037/dev0001349	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001349		APR 2022						35377702					WOS:000777031100001
J	Del Toro, J; Jackson, DB; Wang, MT				Del Toro, Juan; Jackson, Dylan B.; Wang, Ming-Te			The Policing Paradox: Police Stops Predict Youth's School Disengagement Via Elevated Psychological Distress	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Negative interactions with the legal system can inform adolescents' relationships with schools. The present daily-diary study examined 13,545 daily survey assessments from 387 adolescents (M-age = 13-14; 40% male; 32% Black, 50% White, and 18% Other ethnic-racial minority) across 35 days to assess whether police stops predicted adolescents' school disengagement through their psychological distress as a mediator. Results showed that 9% of youth experienced at least one police stop, and 66 stops occurred in total over the 35-day study course. Youth stopped by the police reported greater next-day school disengagement, and youth's psychological distress mediated the link between police stops and school disengagement. Disengagement did not predict youth's next-day police stops. In addition, ethnic-racial minority youth reported more negative police encounters than did White youth, and the effect of a police stop on next-day psychological distress was more negative for Other ethnic-racial minority youth. Implications for reducing police intervention in adolescents' lives are discussed.

J	Borovsky, A				Borovsky, Arielle			Lexico-Semantic Structure in Vocabulary and Its Links to Lexical Processing in Toddlerhood and Language Outcomes at Age Three	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Toddlerhood is marked by advances in several lexico-semantic skills, including improvements in the size and structure of the lexicon and increased efficiency in lexical processing. This project seeks to delineate how early changes in vocabulary size and vocabulary structure support lexical processing (Experiment 1), and how these three skills together (vocabulary size, structure, and lexical processing) relate to later language outcomes at age 3 (Experiment 2). Experiment 1 explored how the size and semantic structure of toddlers' vocabulary from 18 to 24 months (N = 61) predicted performance on two lexical processing tasks (semantically related and semantically unrelated trials). Denser semantic connectivity (i.e., global level connectivity between near and far neighbors) positively associated with semantic interference during semantically related lexical processing, whereas denser category structure (i.e., lower-level connectivity between near neighbors) facilitated lexical processing in semantically unrelated trials. In Experiment 2, a subset of the same children (N = 49) returned at age 36 months and completed a comprehensive assessment of their language skills using the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamental, Preschool 2 (CELF-P2). Here, earlier measures of lexico-semantic connectivity and lexical processing best predicted age 3 language skill. The findings support accounts that early vocabulary structure and lexical processing skills promote continued growth in language.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				APR	2022	58	4					607	630		10.1037/dev0001291	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001291								35343711					WOS:000773043400007

Two waves of data collection included 338 monolingual children (17-36 months; 143 female) at Time 1 and 308 children (32-55 months; 139 female) at Time 2 and their caregivers, whose education ranged from third grade (elementary school) or below to postgraduate with a median of high school. Our data showed a clear order of grammatical marking acquisition among these children and supported findings on the linguistic specificity of morphological development such that early- and late-acquired markers in Mandarin are not acquired in the same order as English or other languages. Negative "mei2," "bu4," possessive "-de," classifiers, and the aspect marker "le" were the earliest-acquired markers, followed by modals, negative "bie2," adverbs, sentence final particles, resultative verb compounds, and aspect markers "guo4" and "yao4." Complex clauses and the aspect marker "zheng4" were acquired the latest. Furthermore, consistent with previous cross-linguistic studies, the development patterns of a wide range of Mandarin grammatical markers indicate that markers that are more perceptually salient and obligatory, have clear form-meaning mappings, and often appear in isolation or utterance-final position were acquired earlier than others.

Children's Trust in and Learning From Voice Assistants	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												As children increasingly interact with digital voice assistants, it is important to know whether they treat these devices as reliable information sources. Two studies investigated children's trust in and recall of statements made by a novel voice assistant and a human informant. In Study 1, children ages 4-5 (M-age = 5.05; 20 boys, 20 girls) and 7-8 (M-age = 7.98; 18 boys, 22 girls) from predominately White, upper middle-class families heard each informant respond to questions from multiple categories. With increasing age, children showed greater trust in the voice assistant for factual information and greater trust in the human for personal information about the experimenter identified as her friend. Endorsement of each informant's statements also predicted later recall. In Study 2, children ages 4-5 (M-age = 5.00; 20 boys, 20 girls) and 7-8 (M-age = 8.03; 19 boys, 21 girls) from predominately White, upper middle-class families chose whether to seek out information from a voice assistant or human informant. With increasing age, children showed an increasing preference to seek factual information from the voice assistant and an increasing preference to seek personal information from the human. Additionally, children's preferences were not related to attributions of epistemic capacities to each informant nor the presence of a voice assistant in children's homes. These results suggest that children's trust in voice assistants varies with age and depends on the type of information involved.

DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Creating objects can increase our evaluation of them, even when we compare them to physically identical copies (IKEA effect). Here we evaluate the influence of collaboration on the IKEA effect in two societies-the United Kingdom and India. One hundred twenty-eight 5-to-6-year-old children (48% female, 50% British middle class, 50% Indian middle class) assembled toys in pairs. Half of the children collaborated to assemble a single toy and half assembled their own toy. In both societies, children demonstrated an IKEA effect (eta(2)(p) = .19), valuing their own creation over an identical copy. This was the case regardless of whether children collaborated or worked independently. In summary, it seems that the IKEA effect is a potent bias that is present in diverse societies and is insensitive to others' contributions in a collaborative environment.

Here, we examined what young children infer when they observe stewardship behavior of an object. Through four experiments on predominantly middle-class Canadian children (total N = 350, 168 girls and 182 boys from a predominantly White and middle-class region), we found that children as young as 4 or 5 infer feelings of ownership from stewardship behaviors and distinguish between psychological and legal ownership. They also understand that psychological and legal ownership are independent as one can exist without the other, and children as young as 3 may link stewardship with welfare concerns. We also suggest that while stewardship has been shown to be a consequence of psychological ownership, it is also likely to be an antecedent. As future stewards of our resources, young children's understanding of the link between psychological ownership and stewardship links directly to sustainability concerns. We contribute theoretically both to the child development and psychological ownership literatures.

Children (N = 192; 4-6 years of age; 49.5% male, 50.5% female; middle-income Chinese families) participated in a modified temptation resistance paradigm where they were asked not to peek at a toy in the absence of an experimenter. Next, the children were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: (a) guilt condition, where children were induced with guilt using a revised mishap paradigm; (b) sadness condition, where children were induced with sadness by watching a video; and (c) baseline condition, where children did not participate in any additional emotion-inducing task. When later questioned about whether they peeked at the toy, children in the guilt condition were significantly less likely to lie compared with those in the sadness or baseline conditions. There was no significant difference between the sadness and baseline conditions.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				APR	2022	58	4					693	699		10.1037/dev0001323	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001323								35343716					WOS:000773043400016

A Comparative Study of Children Born in US and UK Cities	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Residential mobility is a normal feature of family life but thought to be a source of disruption to a child's development. Mobility may have its own direct consequences or reflect families' capabilities and vulnerabilities. This article examines the association between changes of residence and verbal and behavioral scores of children aged 5, contributing to the literature in three ways. First, it compares two countries, by drawing on the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study in the United States (N = up to 1,820) and an urban subsample of the U.K. Millennium Cohort study (N = up to 7,967). Second, beside taking into account an extensive range of demographic characteristics, it applies inverse probability weights to minimize observable selection bias associated with residential mobility and further controls for a wide range of family changes that often co-occur with moves. Third, the article adds to extant research on residential mobility by incorporating the type of locality from and into which families move. Individual-level longitudinal data are linked to objective measures of neighborhood socioeconomic status to gauge the quality of moves families make. Results show that residential moves are not inevitably deleterious to children. In both countries the poorer outcomes of some moves result not from moving per se but rather from the context in which they occur.

First, using longitudinal multilevel structural equation modeling, it was shown that aggressive behavior and victimization preceded lower school liking, achievement, and social class climate at the individual student level over 1 year (Sample 1: 665 Austrian preadolescents, 46.62% girls, first wave: M-age = 11.68 years, SD = 0.84). Second, the results from multilevel latent profile analysis revealed relations between aggression and school functioning profiles and allowed identifying distinct latent classes at the classroom level based on the relative frequency of these profiles (Sample 2: 1,639 Austrian preadolescents, 47.59% girls, M-age = 11.70 years, SD = 0.86). Aligned with cumulative risk perspectives, aggressor-victims belonged significantly more often to the least adaptive school functioning profile and the less adaptive latent class at the classroom level than uninvolved youth.

Data were drawn from a longitudinal study of executive control development in a community sample of children (N = 294; 53% female, 47% male) oversampled for low family income (25.4% below poverty line; M-income = $46,638; SD = $33,256). The sample was representative of the Midwestern city in which the study was conducted in terms of race (71.4% White, 24.5% multiracial, 3.7% Black, and .3% Asian American) and ethnicity (14% Hispanic). Children completed a battery of ten performance-based tasks assessing executive control abilities in grades 1 (M-age = 7.08 years), 2 (M-age = 8.04 years), 3 (M-age = 9.02 years), and 4 (M-age = 9.98 years). Confirmatory factor analysis supported a two-factor structure at each grade with factors representing working memory and inhibitory control/flexible shifting. Measurement invariance testing revealed partial scalar (indicator intercepts) invariance for working memory and partial metric (indicator loadings) and partial scalar invariance for inhibitory control/flexible shifting. Preschool executive control (age 4.5 years), represented by a unitary latent factor, significantly predicted working memory (beta s = .79, .72, .81, .66) and inhibitory control/flexible shifting (beta s = .69, .64, .63, .62) factors in grades 1 through 4. Follow-up analyses indicated that the findings were not attributable to general cognitive ability. Findings support greater separability of executive control components in elementary school versus preschool, and considerable continuity of executive control from preschool through elementary school.

Participants (N = 3,944; age: M = 20.8 years, SD = 19.6, range: 3-85; maternal/self education: M = 12.9 years, SD = 2.6; 53.3% girls/women, 46.7% boys/men; 61.1% White, 18.2% African American, 14.0% Latinx, 6.8% other races/ethnicities) completed tests of inhibition, shifting, and updating/working memory. Zero-order and partial correlation network models were calculated for divided age groups, with network parameters compared between groups: edge weights, corresponding to zero-order or partial correlations between two executive functions; expected influence, quantifying centrality; and global strength, quantifying differentiation. Executive functions differentiated from childhood to adolescence and dedifferentiated during young adulthood, with further dedifferentiation at older adulthood. Shifting emerged as more central than other abilities in adolescence and adulthood versus childhood, with a mediational role of shifting between inhibition and updating/working memory. A network approach can appropriately capture the unity and diversity of executive functions, by which unity reflects the reciprocal engagement between diverse abilities to produce goal-directed behavior. The engagement between abilities, and a mediational role of shifting between inhibition and updating/working memory, may be necessary for the emergence of effective goal-directed behavior. Through a network approach, the unity of executive functions represents an emergent property of the dynamics between multiple abilities (e.g., inhibition, shifting, and updating/working memory) that, when working effectively in tandem, lead to integrative processes (e.g., problem solving) that contribute to successful executive behavior and goal attainment.

However, to date, almost no work has explored the distinctive ways that different listeners might shape narration, and the socioemotional outcomes of narrating experience. The present study examines how early adolescents (n = 106, age range 12-14, 54 girls, 21% low-income, 7% Latinx, 3% non-White) narrate anger experiences to mothers and close same-sex friends. Our findings suggest that these two listeners provide distinct affordances for narration, with implications for emotions and learning. Mothers provide a more elaborative, emotion-focused narrative context, whereas friends provide a playful, creative narrative context. Friends elicit larger reductions in distress than mothers, although listener-associated differences in learning were more complex. Findings are discussed in terms of implications for narrative development specifically as well as more generally for relatively underexamined aspects of narrative across adolescence and adulthood.

Understanding parent-driven socialization is particularly relevant in adolescence, as an increasing social independence is developed. However, the relationship between key parenting styles of care and control and the microlevel expression of daily-life social interactions has been insufficiently studied. Adolescent and young adult twins and their nontwin siblings (N = 635; mean age = 16.6; age range = 14.2-21.9; 58.6% female; 79.5% in or having completed higher secondary/tertiary education; 2.8% speaking language other than Dutch at home) completed the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI) on parental care and control. Participants also completed a 6-day experience sampling period (10 daily beeps, mean compliance = 68.0%) to assess daily-life social interactions. Higher overall parental bonding quality (of both parents) related to more positive social experiences in daily life (e.g., belonging in company), but not to more social behaviors (e.g., being with others). Factor analysis indicated a three-factor structure of the PBI, with care, denial of psychological autonomy, and encouragement of behavioral freedom. Paternal care was uniquely predictive of better social experiences. These findings demonstrate how parenting styles may be uniquely associated with how adolescents experience their social world, with a potentially important role for fathers in particular. This complements the long-held idea of socialization through parenting by bringing it into the context of daily life and implies how both conceptualizations of social functioning and interventions aimed at alleviating social dysfunction might benefit from a stronger consideration of day-to-day social experiences.

DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Past meta-analyses show that both child-mother and child-father attachment insecurity are independently and jointly associated with more externalizing behaviors in children. Little is known, however, on the ways that different types of insecure attachment independently and jointly predict the development of externalizing behaviors over time. Existing work also neglects the impact of children's gender within the context of child-father relationships. The current study addresses these limitations by investigating how insecure type of child-father attachment, child-mother attachment, and their interaction in the preschool years predict boys' and girls' externalizing behaviors in middle childhood, when controlling for children's externalizing behaviors in the preschool years. The sample included 144 preschool-aged children (M = 46.89 months, SD = 8.77, 83 girls) and both of their parents. At Time 1, children completed independent separation-reunion procedures with each parent, which were coded using the Preschool Attachment Rating Scales. At Time 1 and Time 2 (5 years later), mothers and fathers completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire to report on their children's externalizing behaviors. Results showed no systematic differences in the way that child-mother and child-father attachment predicted the development of externalizing behaviors in boys and girls. Across all children, results identified an interaction of child-father and child-mother ambivalence, by which the presence of ambivalence toward both parents predicted the development of more externalizing behaviors. In addition, child-father controlling-caregiving attachment predicted the development of fewer externalizing behaviors. These results provide insight into the ways that insecure child-father and child-mother attachment predict later socioemotional adaptation.

Similarity of Friends Versus Nonfriends in Adolescence: Developmental Patterns and Ecological Influences	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examines developmental change across adolescence in the similarity of friends versus nonfriends. This differential in similarity is a key aspect of the organization of the peer context of development: The stronger the correlation between friends for an attribute, the more the attribute delineates clustering and divisions of friendships. We investigated change in the correlation between friends across 12 attributes covering demographics, orientations to key institutions (family, school, religion), and problem behavior, and we expected that the link between similarity and friendship would increase during adolescence for most attributes other than gender. We also predicted that the social ecological factors of school size and attribute variability would be associated with stronger correlations between friends and partially mediate developmental change. Data are from two grade cohorts of 27 small school districts, followed from sixth through 11th grades (N = 454 time-specific networks and over 65,000 person/waves of data; 84.2% White, 6.8% Hispanic/Latino, 3.2% African American, 1.3% Asian, .5% Native American, 3.9% other or multiple). The data analysis takes the form of a three-level random effects meta-analysis of network level correlations between friends (Moran's I). As expected, declining dominance of gender was offset by the emergence of moderate correlations across a broader profile of attributes. The ecological opportunity factors of grade cohort size and attribute variability significantly mediated these increases in correlations between friends, accounting for 23 to 73% of age-related change for 10 of the 11 attributes other than gender.

Fine Motor Skills During Early Childhood Predict Visuospatial Deductive Reasoning in Adolescence	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Extensive evidence and theory suggest that the development of motor skills during infancy and early childhood initiates a "developmental cascade" for cognitive abilities, such as reading and math. Motor skills are closely connected with the development of spatial cognition, an ability that supports deductive reasoning. Despite the linkage between motor skills and spatial cognition, and spatial cognition with deductive reasoning, no research has explored the developmental connection between early motor skills and reasoning ability, a plausible pathway through which the developmental cascade operates. Drawing data from the 1970 British Cohort Study (N = 1,233; 95% British, 5% other race/ethnicity; 54% male, 46% female; 7% low income, 80% middle income, 12% high income), this study investigated whether there was a relationship between gross and fine motor skills in infancy (22 months of age) and early childhood (42 months of age) and visuospatial deductive reasoning in adolescence (at 10 and 16 years of age). Results indicated that fine but not gross motor skills during early childhood positively predicted reasoning in adolescence. Critically, the fine motor-reasoning association mediated the previously observed link between early fine motor skills and adolescent reading and math ability. These results deepen our understanding of developmental cascade theory and mental model theory by identifying visuospatial reasoning (i.e., mental modeling) as a potential mechanism through which motor skills initiate cognitive development and academic success in reading and math. These findings also highlight the importance of early intervention programs targeting motor skills and illuminate the impact of those interventions on later cognitive and academic skills.

A Longitudinal Observational Test in the Context of a Parenting Program	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Caregivers are often encouraged to praise children to reduce externalizing behavior. Although several theoretical perspectives suggest that praise works (e.g., praise reinforces positive behavior), others suggest it may not (e.g., children dismiss praise or experience it as controlling). This longitudinal-observational study examined whether (a) caregivers' praise and children's externalizing behavior were related; (b) an evidence-based parenting program increased caregivers' praise; (c) and increasing praise reduced children's externalizing behavior. Participants (387 caregiver-child dyads) were randomly assigned to a 14-session parenting program (aiming to improve parenting behavior, partly via praise) or a control group. Children (aged 4-8 years, 45% girls) scored at or above the 75th percentile on externalizing behavior problems. Caregivers (91% Caucasian, 85% born in the Netherlands, 50.5% highly educated) were mostly mothers (91%). At baseline, postintervention, and follow-up, we assessed caregivers' labeled and unlabeled praise via in-home observations, and children's externalizing behavior via caregiver-reports and observations. At baseline, caregivers' unlabeled praise was related to more (rather than less) externalizing behavior. The parenting program successfully increased praise and reduced caregiver-reported (but not observed) externalizing behavior; importantly, however, praise did not mediate the program's effect on caregiver-reported externalizing behavior. Although the program did not directly reduce observed externalizing behavior, it did so indirectly via labeled praise. Our results suggest that, although praise and externalizing child behavior are related, praise may not be a key mechanism underlying the effects of the parenting program. If praise has beneficial effects on children's externalizing behavior, these effects are probably limited to labeled praise.

J	Lee, YE; Warneken, F				Lee, Young-eun; Warneken, Felix			Does Third-Party Punishment in Children Aim at Equality?	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Third-party punishment has been regarded as an important mechanism to promote fairness. Although previous research has shown that children aged 6 and older punish unfair behaviors at a personal cost, it is unknown whether they actually intend to establish equality or whether equality is a mere byproduct of punishment. In this preregistered study, N = 60 five- to 9-year-olds witnessed that an agent made unfair resource allocations to a peer. Children could then decide not only whether to punish but also how much to punish. We found that with age, children's intervention is more likely to equalize outcomes between third parties (e.g., turning 3:1 into 1:1). In conclusion, the egalitarian motive to reduce differences in payoffs could underlie children's punishment over development.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				MAY	2022	58	5					866	873		10.1037/dev0001331	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001331		MAR 2022						35324225					WOS:000772151500001

Antibullying Program on Ethnic Victimization: When the Peer Educators' Immigrant Status Matters	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Nowadays, an increasing number of children and adolescents living in Europe have an immigrant background. Because ethnicity is a recognizable characteristic that may become the driver of bullying, these youths are at high risk of victimization. School interventions based on peer-led approaches, assuming all the conditions postulated in contact theory, could be suitable to counteract bias-based bullying and victimization. This study aims to analyze whether the NoTrap! antibullying program, an evidence-based peer-led intervention, may also be effective in counteracting ethnic bullying and victimization when students with an immigrant background are involved as peer educators. There were 1,570 students who participated in the study: 24 control classes (N = 476) and 50 experimental classes (N = 1094). Within the last group we identified two conditions: 30 classes in which all peer educators were Italian (Experimental A, N = 661); 20 classes in which at least one of them had an immigrant background (Experimental B, N = 433). Results of two linear mixed models showed a significant interaction Time x Experimental condition for ethnic victimization, F(1, 1170) = 4.185; p = .015. Specifically, the NoTrap! is effective in reducing ethnic victimization when at least one student with an immigrant background is involved as a peer educator. Only in this condition, indeed, peer educators are directly involved in the phenomenon they counteract, and all four circumstances postulated in the contact theory are satisfied. No effects on ethnic bullying have been found, F(1, 1162) = .215; p = .806. This is in line with the activities proposed in the program, which is more focused on empowering victims than on acting directly on bullies.

Reexamining the Cultural Specificity of Controlling and Autonomy-Supportive Parenting in the United States and China With a Within-Individual Analytic Approach	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This research examines whether prior research may not have detected cultural-specificity in the role of controlling and autonomy-supportive parenting in children's adjustment because of reliance on between-individual analyses. In two longitudinal studies (Ns = 825 and 934) of early adolescents, within-individual analyses were conducted to examine the reciprocal pathways between children's reports of parenting and their reports of their adjustment in the United States and China. Increments in controlling parenting predicted decrements in children's emotional and behavioral, but generally not academic, adjustment over time, with little evidence that this was stronger in the United States than in China. Decrements in children's emotional and behavioral, but generally not academic, adjustment predicted increments in controlling parenting over time similarly in the two countries. There were few overtime pathways involving autonomy-supportive parenting in either direction in either country.					xiong, yu/JAX-3589-2023; Wang, Qian/J-1412-2012	xiong, yu/0000-0003-2951-1026; Pomerantz, Eva/0000-0003-0259-2700; Qin, Lili/0000-0002-7820-7269; Wang, Qian/0000-0003-2319-6969													0012-1649	1939-0599				MAY	2022	58	5					935	949		10.1037/dev0001329	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001329		MAR 2022						35324223					WOS:000772148800001

Children's Attributions of Moral and Epistemic Virtue: Effects on Learning and Memory	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												One developmental task faced by children is to identify, remember, and learn from epistemic and moral agents around them who are known to be good or virtuous. Here, in 2 studies, we examined U.S children's (N = 138; 55% female, 45% male; predominantly White, middle-class) memory processes for agents varying in moral and epistemic virtue. In Study 1, when presented with 16 faces of individuals who were said to vary in moral or epistemic virtue, children demonstrated enhanced trait memory for the characteristics of agents lacking in virtue relative to their more moral and competent counterparts. In Study 2, when presented with pairs of faces in the moral and epistemic domains, children showed enhanced content memory for information communicated by an epistemically competent individual with age. Together, these findings provide evidence that when categorizing single agents among many, children show better memory for their negative characteristics; and in a learning context, children show better retention of information communicated by more competent agents.

However, no studies have simultaneously examined these two environmental supports in relation to children's early language skills and later literacy skills across elementary school. The current study examined how multiple years of early maternal language input from 6 to 36 months and later classroom instructional quality from pre-kindergarten (pre-K) through fifth grade were related to children's early language at 36 months and later literacy trajectories in word recognition and reading comprehension across elementary school. The study included a diverse, population-representative sample of 1,292 children who were born in low-wealth rural communities and followed through fifth grade. Video recordings and subsequent transcripts of mother-child shared picture book tasks in the home at four timepoints during early childhood were used to assess maternal diversity of vocabulary, utterance complexity, and engagement (wh-questions) during book sharing. The quality of instruction in elementary school was assessed using classroom observations from pre-K through fifth grade. Maternal complexity and engagement were indirectly related to children's literacy trajectories across pre-K to fifth grade through effects on early child language at 36 months. Higher-quality classroom instruction was not reliably related to concurrent literacy skills in pre-K through fifth grade. Findings suggested the enduring importance of early maternal language input in predicting children's early language and later literacy skill development during elementary school.

Evidence for Losses and Gains	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic might have affected older adults' personal and general views on aging (VoA) because they were frequently, particularly during the early phase of the pandemic, portrayed as a homogeneous, vulnerable group in the media and in public debates. Also, their higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease progression as well as other pandemic-related stressors and restrictions might have impacted how older adults perceive their own aging. In this study, it was examined to which extent middle-aged and older adults' personal and general VoA changed due to the pandemic by distinguishing between normative age-graded change across multiple measurement occasions and potentially pandemic-specific history-graded change. Multiple VoA indicators (personal VoA: attitude toward own aging, subjective age, awareness of age-related change [gains and losses]; general VoA: domain-specific age stereotypes) of 423 German adults aged 40 years and older were assessed across three prepandemic measurement occasions (2012, 2015, and 2017) and one occasion after the pandemic's outbreak (summer 2020). Normative age-graded changes and pandemic-specific changes were estimated and compared using longitudinal multilevel regression analyses. Both perceived age-related gains and age-related losses decreased between 2012 and 2017, but increased thereafter between 2017 and 2020. Further, the overall change trend toward less positive attitude toward own aging slowed down from 2017 to 2020. There was also a slight trend toward younger subjective ages from 2017 to 2020. For most age stereotypes, pandemic-specific trends indicated a shift toward more negative stereotypes. These findings suggest that pandemic-specific changes in VoA are multidirectional, comprising perceptions of both losses and gains.

Stable Truthiness Effect Across the Lifespan	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												When semantically-related photos appear with true-or-false trivia claims, people more often rate the claims as true compared to when photos are absent-truthiness. This occurs even when the photos lack information useful for assessing veracity. We tested whether truthiness changed in magnitude as a function of participants' age in a diverse sample using materials appropriate for all ages. We tested participants (N = 414; Age range = 3-87 years) in two culturally diverse environments: a community science center (First language: English (61.4%); Mandarin/Cantonese (11.6%); Spanish (6%), other (21%); ethnicity: unreported) and a psychology lab (First language: English (64.4%); Punjabi (9.8%); Mandarin/Cantonese (7.4%); other (18.4%); ethnicity: Caucasian (38%); South Asian (30.7%); Asian (22.7%); other/unreported (8.6%). Participants rated trivia claims as true or false. Half the claims appeared with a semantically related photo, and half appeared without a photo. Results showed that participants of all ages more often rated claims as true when claims appeared with a photo; however, this truthiness effect was stable across the lifespan. If truthiness age differences exist, they are likely negligible in the general population.

Flexibility in Action: Development of Locomotion Under Overhead Barriers	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Behavioral flexibility-the ability to tailor motor actions to changing body-environment relations-is critical for functional movement. Navigating the everyday environment requires the ability to generate a wide repertoire of actions, select the appropriate action for the current situation, and implement it quickly and accurately. We used a new, adjustable barrier paradigm to assess flexibility of motor actions in 20 17-month-old (eight girls, 12 boys) and 14 13-month-old (seven girls, eight boys) walking infants and a comparative sample of 14 adults (eight women, six men). Most participants were White, non-Hispanic, and middle class. Participants navigated under barriers normalized to their standing height (overhead, eye, chest, hip, and knee heights). Decreases in barrier height required lower postures for passage. Every participant altered their initial walking posture according to barrier height for every trial, and all but two 13-month-olds found solutions for passage. Compared to infants, adults displayed a wider variety of strategies (squat-walking, half-kneeling, etc.), found more appropriate solutions based on barrier height (ducked at eye height and low crawled at knee height), and implemented their solutions more quickly (within 4 s) and accurately (without bumping their heads against the barrier). Infants frequently crawled even when the barrier height did not warrant a low posture, displayed multiple postural shifts prior to passage and thus took longer to go, and often bumped their heads. Infants' improvements were related to age and walking experience. Thus, development of flexibility likely involves the contributions of multiple domains-motor, perception, and cognition-that facilitate strategy selection and implementation.

J	Barak, L; Degani, T; Novogrodsky, R				Barak, Lara; Degani, Tamar; Novogrodsky, Rama			Influences of Bilingualism and Developmental Language Disorder on How Children Learn and Process Words	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Previous studies found that bilingual children and adults with typical language development (TLD) perform better than monolinguals in novel word learning, but show lower scores on lexical retrieval tasks (e.g., naming known words). Children with developmental language disorder (DLD) lack in their abilities in both tasks compared with children with TLD. The current study tested the interplay between bilingualism and language disorder during novel word learning and lexical retrieval. Preschoolers (N = 101; 50 boys and 51 girls; mothers' mean years of education = 16.35) in four groups (Hebrew monolinguals or Russian-Hebrew bilinguals with DLD or TLD) learned 12 novel real words (6 with a familiar referent and 6 with a novel referent) and performed a lexical retrieval task. Children exhibited significant learning with no effect of bilingualism, but a negative effect of language disorder. Thus, children with DLD performed worse than children with TLD, and this ability was not affected by bilingualism. In lexical retrieval, DLD groups scored lower than TLD groups, and critically also bilinguals scored lower than monolinguals. This differential effect of bilingualism in the two tasks suggests that bilingualism does not impede language learning mechanisms even among children with DLD. Instead, the findings suggest that lower performance in the lexical retrieval task is due to decreased frequency of exposure. By exploring both word learning and lexical retrieval, the study highlights the differential mechanisms at play in the effects of bilingualism and language disorder on the developing lexicon.

Distinctions Between Moral and Conventional Judgments From Early to Middle Childhood: A Meta-Analysis of Social Domain Theory Research	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Understanding distinctions between morality and conventions is an important milestone in children's moral development. The current meta-analysis integrated decades of social domain theory research (Smetana, 2006; Turiel, 1983) on moral and conventional judgments from early to middle childhood. We examined 95 effect sizes from 18 studies (2,707 children; M-age = 7.30 years; 51% females; 42% Whites). Along with these, effects from additional 28 studies were estimated with imputed correlations in a secondary analysis of 248 effect sizes from 46 studies (4,469 children; M-age = 7.34 years; 46% females; 32% Whites). Across all judgments, moral/conventional distinction effects were significant, positive, and moderate. Consistent with social domain theory definitions of morality, children evaluated moral transgressions as more wrong independent of authorities' commands or rules than conventional transgressions and moral rules as more generalizable and inalterable than conventional rules. Moral transgressions also were seen as more unacceptable and more deserving of punishment than conventional transgressions. The aggregated effects were also significant for each type of judgment. However, effects were stronger for criteria considered definitional of the domains than for acceptability or punishment judgments, which are not considered criteria. Moreover, children made greater domain distinctions with age across all types of judgments. When examined separately, age moderated effects only for criterion judgments, not for acceptability or punishment judgments. Effects for distinctions also were moderated by the types of moral and conventional rules assessed. Thus, moral/conventional distinctions were found across early and middle childhood, but there was variability in children's developing understanding.

Five- and 7-year-old children (n = 160, 50% female, predominantly White from lower-middle- to middle-class families) had to remember to put cards with a picture of a dog into a box (placed behind the child) every time they finished working on an activity book with a line drawing on each page (activity-based PM task). Additionally, the picture presented on the last page of each activity book was manipulated to examine the role of incidental reminders on PM. Results showed that 7-year-old children significantly outperformed 5-year-olds on the PM task despite age equivalence of performance on the ongoing visual search task. For both age groups, an incidental reminder (a line drawing of a dog) that was similar to the target of the PM task (a card with a color picture of a dog) significantly improved PM compared to the no-reminder condition (a line drawing of a flower), while reminders related to the PM action (a line drawing of a box) or semantically related to the target of the PM task (a line drawing of a cat) were not effective. These findings have important practical and theoretical implications and open up interesting avenues for future research.

Development of Updating in Working Memory in 4-7-Year-Old Children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Children live in a dynamic environment, in which objects continually change locations and move into and out of occlusion. Children must therefore rely on working memory to store information from the environment and to update those stored representations as the environment changes. Previous work suggests that the ability to store information in working memory increases through infancy and childhood. However, less is known about the development of the ability to update stored information. Participants were 63 4-7-year-old children (37 girls; 34 caregivers completed optional demographic forms, and those children were reported as Asian [one], Asian/White [four], Black [one], Middle East/Arab [one], or White [27]; two were Hispanic/Latinx). We asked children to keep track of arrays of hidden items that either remained where they were hidden (static trials) or swapped locations (swap trials) and then to identify from two alternatives which item was hidden in a particular location. We manipulated the number of items in the arrays and the number of times the items swapped locations in order to investigate how increasing storage and updating load impacted children's performance. We found that children's ability to update working memory developed significantly across our age range. Updating appeared to impose a significant one-time cost to working memory performance, regardless of the number of times items swapped. Our results yield new insights into the developmental trajectories of storage and updating in working memory across early childhood.

The Role of School Friendship Stability, Instability, and Network Size in Early Adolescents' Social Adjustment	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examined longitudinal associations between early adolescents' school friendship stability, instability, and network size and their perceived social adjustment. The final sample consisted of 430 early adolescents residing in seven Midwestern schools (52% female, 47% Black, 42% White, 5% Hispanic or Latinx, and 6% Other). School friendship stability, instability, and network size were assessed via students' peer nominations of their same-grade friendships collected midway through their 7(th) and 8(th) grade years. Students also self-reported on several measures of social adjustment (their social satisfaction, social confidence, and school belonging). Results indicated having new friendships and having a larger friendship network at school were each more predictive of early adolescents' perceived social adjustment than was having maintained friendships or a consistent friend group within this context. However, school friendship stability consistently predicted greater perceived school belonging, whereas having a primarily new friend group and/or having lost more or most of a prior friend group predicted lower levels of this perception. Having lost school friendships was not predictive of early adolescents' social adjustment except when losses composed a significant proportion of their school friendship network (i.e., they had lost more or most of their school friendships from the year before). These findings provide valuable insights about peer friendship dynamics and social adjustment during a life stage critical to social development.

Phonological awareness-the ability to identify and manipulate the sound units of oral language-has been reported to play a central role in reading acquisition. However, current evidence is mixed with respect to its universal contribution to reading acquisition across orthographies. This longitudinal study examines the development and contribution of phonological awareness to early reading skills in Spanish, a transparent orthography. The results of a comprehensive battery of phonological awareness skills in a large sample of children (Time 1 n = 616, 296 females, mean age 5.6, from middle to high socioeconomic backgrounds; Time 2 n = 397) with no reading experience at study onset suggest that the development of phonological awareness is delayed in Spanish. Furthermore, our results show that phonological awareness does not contribute to the prediction of reading acquisition above and beyond other preliteracy skills. Letter knowledge indexes children's ability to identify phonemes and thus takes a more central role in the prediction of early reading skills. Therefore, we underscore the need to thoughtfully address the distinctive features of the reading acquisition process across orthographies, which should be taken into account in models of reading and learning to read.

The Codevelopment of Reading and Attention From Middle Childhood to Early Adolescence: A Multivariate Latent Growth Curve Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Attention skills are strong cross-sectional predictors of reading comprehension from childhood through to adolescence. However, less is known about the developmental relations between these two domains across this period. This study examined the codevelopment of reading and attention in a community sample of 614 Australian school students (50% female). Reading and attention were assessed at ages 8, 10, 12, and 14. Results of univariate latent growth models demonstrated, on average, curvilinear trajectories for reading in which rapid growth across younger age spans decelerates as children reach adolescence. By contrast, attention skills remained relatively stable on average. Significant negative correlations were observed between the intercept and slope factors in separate reading (r = -.62) and attention models (r = -.39) suggesting compensatory growth patterns in which poorer performing students in both domains at age 8 have steeper trajectories than their higher performing peers. A comparison of a multivariate latent growth model and an autoregressive latent trajectory model with structured residuals (ALT-SR) examined the interrelatedness of development in reading and attention. Both between-individual and within-individual cross-domain parameters showed reading and attention to be positively related at Grade 3, indicating an association between better attention and higher reading achievement at age 8. However, there was little evidence for interrelated growth across domains in this sample. The results contribute to theories which explain whether and how multiple cognitive domains codevelop over a substantial period of childhood and early adolescence.

J	Zhang, Z; Peng, P				Zhang, Zheng; Peng, Peng			Reading Real Words Versus Pseudowords: A Meta-Analysis of Research in Developmental Dyslexia	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Word reading is critical for reading development. However, it has long been debated on the processes involved in real word and pseudoword decoding in developmental dyslexia (DD). We conducted a meta-analysis of 28 neuroimaging studies (519 participants with DD, 562 typical readers, age range 5-63 years, female 37.65%, 382 foci, 64 experimental contrasts) using effect-size signed differential mapping. Individuals with DD compared with typical readers showed hypoactivity in the left-lateralized reading network, including the occipitotemporal regions, temporoparietal regions, and inferior frontal gyri (pars triangularis and pars opercularis), in real word and pseudoword decoding. In pseudoword compared with real word decoding, hypoactivity was more severely reduced in the inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis). Metaregression showed that no hypoactivity was associated with age in real word decoding, whereas in pseudoword decoding, hypoactivity in the left superior temporal gyrus was negatively associated with age and hypoactivity in the left inferior temporal gyrus was quadratically associated with age. Accommodating the connectionist triangle model, our findings demonstrate that DD may be associated with abnormalities in both the direct orthography-phonology and the indirect orthography-semantics-phonology pathways across real word and pseudoword decoding. Compared with real word decoding, pseudoword decoding in those with DD may be more associated with abnormalities in the indirect pathway. With development, abnormalities in both pathways seem stable in real word decoding. In pseudoword decoding, abnormalities in the indirect pathway become more severe initially but could be improved in later development; abnormalities in the direct pathway could be persistently becoming more severe with age.

Training Young Children in Strategic Deception Promotes Epistemic Vigilance	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Learning from others allows young children to acquire vast amounts of information quickly, but doing so effectively also requires epistemic vigilance. Although preschool-age children have some capacity to engage in such processes, they often have trouble resisting information from misleading informants. The present research takes a novel strategic deception training approach to addressing this limitation. The approach is grounded in theoretical work on children's recognition of self-other equivalences (Meltzoff, 2007) and in the default tendency to view communication as helpful (Mascaro et al., 2017). Eighty 3-year-old Singaporean children (M-age = 39.36 months, 37 girls, 90.0% Chinese) were randomly assigned to either an experimental condition, in which they were trained on strategic deception, or to a conservation training control condition. Findings showed that the strategic deception training was effective in promoting epistemic vigilance on a semantic task that involved object naming and no pointing, although the effect did not extend to performance on an episodic task that involved pointing to object locations. These findings provide the first evidence of a causal link between young children's reasoning about how to deceive others and their resistance to being misled by others. In doing so, they shed light on the mechanisms that come into play when children learn epistemic vigilance.

With a Little Help From My Empathic Friends: The Role of Peers in the Development of Empathy in Adolescence	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Despite ample research on empathy development, its social origins have been understudied, particularly in the context of peer relations. This two-wave study of Swedish adolescents (N = 318; M-ageT1 = 16.28, SD = .49; 55% females) examined longitudinal associations between youth friendships and empathy. The results showed that adolescents befriended peers with similar levels of empathy and that, controlling for the initial similarity in empathy, youth who had more empathic friends increased in empathy over time compared with youth with less empathic friends. These selection and influence effects were comparable for the affective and cognitive empathy components (i.e., empathic concern and perspective taking). These results provide strong evidence for the role of friendships in the development of empathy. They underscore the importance of peer-based, social-emotional programs to foster adolescent empathy.

Intraobject and Extraobject Memory Binding Across Early Development	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The ability to bind, or link, different aspects of an experience in memory undergoes protracted development across childhood. Most studies of memory binding development have assessed extraobject binding between an object and some external element such as another object, whereas little work has examined the development of intraobject binding, such as between shape and color features within the same object. In this work, we investigate the development of intra- and extraobject memory binding in five-year-olds, eight-year-olds, and young adults with a memory interference paradigm. Between two experiments, we manipulate whether stimuli are presented as coherent objects (Experiment 1: n(5-year-olds) = 32, 19 males, 13 females; n(8)(-year-olds) = 30, 15 males, 15 females; n(adults) = 30, 15 males, 15 females), requiring intraobject binding between shape and color features, or as spatially separated features (Experiment 2: n(5-year-olds) = 24, 16 males, 8 females; n(8)(-year-olds) = 41, 19 males, 22 females; n(adults) = 31, 13 males, 18 females), requiring extraobject binding. To estimate the contributions of different binding structures to performance, we present a novel computational model that mathematically instantiates the memory binding, forgetting, and retrieval processes we hypothesize to underlie performance on the task. The results provide evidence of substantial developmental improvements in both intraobject and extraobject binding of shape and color features between 5 and 8 years of age, as well as stronger intraobject compared with extraobject binding of features in all age groups. These findings provide key insights into memory binding across early development.

The first objective was to determine if preschool language skills were associated with high school writing, and if so, whether they contributed directly or indirectly through school age language. The second aim was to explore the extent to which genetic and environmental factors explained these potential associations. The sample was drawn from the Quebec Newborn Twin Study, a longitudinal follow-up of twins born in the greater Montreal area, Quebec, Canada. Language skills were assessed when children were 1.5, 2.5, 6, 7, 10, and 12 years old. Writing skills were measured at 15 years old. Participants who completed the writing task in French were included in the study (n = 316 twin pairs: 46% males). Mothers of these participants self-identified mostly as White. About 74% of them had a postsecondary diploma or certificate, and 27% further had a university degree. Most families had an income higher than 30,000 CND. Results indicate that preschool language was modestly associated with high school writing (r = .25) and that school age language fully mediated this association. Genes explained 53% of the association between preschool language and school age language and 64% of the association between school age language and high school writing. These results highlight the developmental continuity from oral to written language from preschool to high school and show that genetic factors largely account for this continuity.

This study evaluates the impacts on narrative language abilities and the costs of a 4-week, strengths-based program that leverages two valued sociocultural practices with built-in benefits, personal narratives, and family food routines (e.g., grocery shopping), for improving Latino kindergarteners' learning outcomes in the United States. Two-hundred and 34 children (M age = 67 months; 51% girls; 13 schools) and their parents participated in a cluster randomized trial. Children produced personal narratives at three time points: pretest, end-of-treatment, and 5-month follow-up. Four narrative features were measured: narrative coherence, elaborations, word types, and literate language features. Large positive impacts were observed on all four narrative features at the end-of-treatment posttest (d = 1.21-1.76). There was suggestive evidence of moderate impacts on one narrative feature (i.e., narrative coherence) at the 5-month follow-up (d = .59). The costs required to implement the family program were relatively low. Findings highlight the potential value of implementing this strengths-based program in schools serving Latino kindergarteners using a rigorous evaluation of its effectiveness.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				MAY	2022	58	5					835	847		10.1037/dev0001332	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001332		MAR 2022						35298191					WOS:000769737000001

Maternal Nighttime Sleep and Infant-Mother Attachment Security: The Mediating Role of Maternal Parenting Quality During Bedtime and Free Play	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The present study examined mothers' emotional availability (EA) during daytime free play and bedtime as a mediator of linkages between maternal nighttime sleep and infant-mother attachment. Participants included 153 mothers (85% White) with infants (53% female). When infants were 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, maternal sleep was assessed using actigraphy and daily sleep diaries for 7 consecutive days. At each time point, mothers' EA was scored from one observation of daytime free play and from one evening observation of infant bedtime by trained observers who were blind to all other participant information. Average scores were created for maternal sleep and EA across the five occasions in the first year. At 12 and 18 months, infant-mother attachment security in the home was scored by blind observers using the Attachment Q-Set, averaged across the two age points, and used in analyses. Mediational analyses revealed that mothers who experienced highly variable sleep and had poor sleep quality were less emotionally available with infants at bedtime during infants' first year of life, which in turn was predictive of lower infant-mother attachment security in the second year, supporting mediation. Linkages between maternal sleep characteristics and daytime EA were less evident. Later maternal sleep timing was also directly predictive of low attachment security, after accounting for maternal EA. Findings emphasize that poor parental sleep places both parenting and infant socioemotional development at risk, and that parental sleep hygiene and sleep habits should be a salient focus of parenting intervention.					bai, liu/KBD-2486-2024	Kim, Christine/0000-0002-1707-1900; Bai, Liu/0000-0001-7018-0594; Teti, Douglas/0000-0002-1574-6257													0012-1649	1939-0599				MAY	2022	58	5					923	934		10.1037/dev0001327	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001327		MAR 2022						35298188					WOS:000769659600001

However, it is unclear how the sense of identity (synthesis and confusion) develops and how it relates to life satisfaction. This study aims to examine the relationship between sense of identity and life satisfaction among Japanese youth living in the urban Kanto, Kansai, and Chubu areas. A total of 5,047 Japanese youth (49.7% female; Time 1 M-age = 17.08 years, range = 12-22 years) in four age groups (early adolescence, middle adolescence, late adolescence, and young adulthood) participated in a three-wave longitudinal study. Latent growth modeling (LGM) analysis revealed that from early to middle adolescence, synthesis continued to be higher than confusion, whereas from late adolescence to young adulthood, confusion tended to be higher than synthesis. The results of the LGM further showed that the change in synthesis was positively related to the change in life satisfaction and the change in confusion was negatively related to it in all age groups. Using latent class growth analysis (LCGA), five identity classes were extracted: high synthesis-low confusion, low synthesis-high confusion, high synthesis-high confusion, low synthesis-low confusion, and moderate synthesis-moderate confusion. LCGA revealed that youth in the high synthesis classes had a higher sense of life satisfaction than did youth in high confusion classes. These findings provide critical insights into trajectories of identity formation and the relationship between identity development and life satisfaction among Japanese youth that can inform future research and programs designed to facilitate their identity formation.

Young Children Rely on Gossip When Jointly Reasoning About Whom to Believe	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												People rely on reputational information communicated via gossip when deciding about with whom to cooperate, whom to believe, and whom to trust. In two studies, we investigated whether 5- and 7-year-old children trust in gossip when determining a course of action. In Study 1, 5- and 7-year-old German-speaking peer dyads (N = 64 dyads, 32 female dyads) were presented with a collaborative problem-solving task (e.g., deciding together what a creature eats). Each child individually received conflicting information about the solution from a different informant (e.g., one proposed rocks; the other proposed sand). Each child additionally heard gossip about the informant's reputation: one informant had a good reputation; the other had a bad reputation. In the experimental condition, the reputation was relevant to the task (honesty), whereas it was irrelevant in the control condition (tidiness). Seven-year-old dyads, and 5-year-old dyads to a lesser extent, settled on the items suggested by the informant with good reputation in the experimental but not in the control condition. Only 7-year-old children explicitly referred to the information conveyed via gossip, engaging in metatalk about the reputations of the informants. In Study 2, we replicated these findings in a more controlled experiment in which 5- and 7-year-old American English-speaking children (N = 48, 27 girls) tried to convince an adult partner who proposed the item suggested by the informant with bad reputation. Thus, starting around age 5, and more reliably at age 7, children selectively rely on gossip in identifying trustworthy individuals in their collaborative reasoning with partners.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				JUN	2022	58	6					1091	1102		10.1037/dev0001066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001066		MAR 2022						35298189					WOS:000769659300001

Children's Self and Other's Body Perception: Effects of Familiarity and Gender on How Children Perceive Adults	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Our ability to perceive our own and other people's bodies is critical to the success of social interactions. Research has shown that adults have a distorted perception of their own body and those of other adults. However, these studies ask perceivers to estimate for adults with a similar bodily make-up. This study explored the developmental progression in how children perceive their own body (6- to 12-year-old children; from a predominantly White urban population of middle socioeconomic status; E1) and whether children have similar distortions as adults when estimating the dimensions of adults' bodies both unknown (E2) and familiar to them (E3). Overall, children showed similar distortions to those found in adult's estimations for own body perception (i.e., limbs with a smaller density of sensory receptors showed a larger error than those with a higher density). Perception of adults' bodies showed less distortion when perceiver and model were of the same gender, but not when the adult was familiar to the child.

Striking a New Path to Study the Adaptation Processes of Immigrant Adolescents: Changes in Language Use and Family Interactions	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Investigating the adoption and use of the host language is one common method for studying acculturation among immigrants. What is less known is how this type of acculturation changes over time and how individual patterns of change can affect other adaptation processes in the host country, for example within families. This study investigated immigrant adolescents' host language use by applying two recently introduced concepts of acculturative change, pace (the speed in which one acculturates) and relative timing (one's acculturation level relative to coethnic peer acculturation levels), and its relation with family interactions (child disclosure, acculturation-related family hassles). Data comprised a three-wave longitudinal sample of 378 ethnic German immigrant parent-adolescent dyads from former Soviet Union in Germany (adolescent M-age = 15.7, 62% girls). Latent True-Change models were used to model pace of acculturative changes between waves. Structural equation analyses revealed that acculturative pace in language use predicted family interactions over time: Pace between Wave 1 and 2 predicted higher levels of child disclosure, pace between Wave 2 and 3 increased acculturation-related family hassles. Associations were stronger among recently immigrated families. Relative timing was not related to family interactions at all. The results highlight that understanding the dynamics in immigrant adolescents' acculturation can explain differences in family functioning. Thus, insights into individual acculturative change trajectories have the potential to broaden current knowledge about immigrants' adaptation processes in general.

DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												In adolescence, being rejected by one's peers is positively associated with aggression. However, whether self-perceptions of being rejected or accepted by peers, and biases in these perceptions, are linked to aggression remains unclear, as the literature points to 2 perspectives: Youth are more likely to be aggressive when they (a) know or believe that they are rejected or (b) overestimate their acceptance. By addressing some of the limitations of prior studies, this study aimed to clarify how self-perceptions of status are related to concurrent and future aggression, and whether high levels of aggression are predictive of biased self-perceptions of acceptance and rejection. Data were collected in 2 consecutive school years from 572 high school students (M-age = 15.06, SD = .75; 55.4% girls). The ethnic/racial composition of the sample was 47.5% Asian, 43.1% Latino/Hispanic, 4.0% White, and 5.3% other. For well-liked youth, awareness of one's acceptance was positively associated with concurrent relational aggression, whereas for highly rejected youth, awareness of one's rejection was positively associated with concurrent overt aggression. Awareness of being rejected (i.e., high levels of both self-perceived and actual rejection) was associated with elevated levels of aggression over time. There was no evidence that youth with high levels of aggression had more biased perceptions of their status (concurrently or longitudinally) than youth with low levels of aggression. These findings help clarify how youth's status-related perceptions relate to the development of aggression.

This gender brilliance stereotype emerges early and may undermine women's engagement in many prestigious careers. However, past research on its acquisition has focused almost exclusively on American children's beliefs of White people's intellectual talents. Therefore, less is known about how this stereotype develops in non-Western cultures and whether children consider other social identities such as race in forming this stereotype. To address these issues, the present research (a) provided the first cross-cultural test examining its development in 5- to 7-year-old Chinese and American children and (b) compared children's gender brilliance stereotype of White people with that of Asian people. Studies 1 (N = 96; Chinese children) and 2 (N = 96; Chinese children) revealed that, similar to American children, Chinese children associated brilliance with White men (vs. White women) around the age of 6. In contrast, Studies 3 (N = 96; Chinese children) and 4 (N = 96; American children; 76.9% White) showed that 5- to 7-year-old children from both cultures associated brilliance with Asian women (vs. Asian men). The results suggest that the gender stereotype about brilliance has a racial component and may be culturally consistent. Overall, these findings add to our knowledge of children's acquisition of the gender stereotype about brilliance in non-Western cultural contexts and highlight the importance of considering multiple social identities to understand the acquisition of stereotypes.

Mothers Talk About Infants' Actions: How Verbs Correspond to Infants' Real-Time Behavior	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Infants learn nouns during object-naming events-moments when caregivers name the object of infants' play (e.g., ball as infant holds a ball). Do caregivers also label the actions of infants' play (e.g., roll as infant rolls a ball)? We investigated connections between mothers' verb inputs and infants' actions. We video-recorded 32 infant-mother dyads for 2 hr at home (13 month olds, n = 16; 18 month olds, n = 16; girls, n = 16; White, n = 23; Asian, n = 2; Black, n = 1; other, n = 1; multiple races, n = 5; Hispanic/Latinx, n = 2). Dyads were predominantly from middle-class to upper middle-class households. We identified each manual verb (e.g., press, shake) and whole-body verb (e.g., kick, go) that mothers directed to infants. We coded whether infants displayed manual and/or whole-body actions during a 6-s window surrounding the verb (i.e., 3 s prior and 3 s after the named verb). Mothers' verbs and infant actions were largely congruent: Whole-body verbs co-occurred with whole-body actions, and manual verbs co-occurred with manual actions. Moreover, half of mothers' verbs corresponded precisely to infants' concurrent action (e.g., infant pressed button as mother said, "Press the button"). In most instances, mothers commented on rather than instigated infants' actions. Findings suggest that verb learning is embodied, such that infants' motor actions offer powerful cues to verb meanings. Furthermore, our approach highlights the value of cross-domain research integrating infants' developing motor and language skills to understand word learning.

Census Tract Ambient Ozone Predicts Trajectories of Depressive Symptoms in Adolescents	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Exposure to ozone is a well-documented risk factor for negative physical health outcomes but has been considered less frequently in the context of socioemotional health. We examined whether levels of neighborhood ozone predicted trajectories of depressive symptoms over a four-year period in 213 adolescents (ages 9-13 years at baseline; 57% female; 53% of minority race/ethnicity). Participants self-reported depressive and other types of psychopathology symptoms up to 3 times, and their home addresses were used to compute ozone levels in their census tract. Possible confounding variables, including personal, family, and neighborhood characteristics, were also assessed. We found that higher ozone predicted steeper increases in depressive symptoms across adolescent development, a pattern that was not observed for other forms of psychopathology symptoms. These findings underscore the importance of considering ozone exposure in understanding trajectories of depressive symptoms across adolescence.

HEU children and HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) children from the community were recruited and tested at 3 to 4 and 5 to 6 years of age. Demographic information, HIV/ARV exposure and measures of intelligence, visuomotor skills, and adaptive functioning were obtained. Nonparametric tests assessed group differences and multiple regression analyses adjusted for demographic variables. Additional multiple regression analyses were performed within the HEU group to investigate associations between neurodevelopmental measures and variables of HIV/ARV exposure. At 3 to 4 years, 211 HEU children and 31 HUU children were assessed, and 144 HEU children and 58 HUU children were assessed at 5 to 6 years of age. At 3 to 4 years of age, HEU children scored significantly lower on measures of Full-Scale IQ, Performance IQ, visual motor integration, and adaptive functioning. At 5 to 6 years of age, HEU children scored significantly lower on all neurodevelopmental measures. At both ages, children who were female and those with mothers who were employed achieved higher scores on measures intellectual ability and/or adaptive functioning. Within the HEU group, no consistent associations were found between neurodevelopmental measures and HIV/ARV specific variables. HEU children demonstrated significantly lower scores on neurodevelopmental measures than HUU children during early childhood. Gaps in verbal intellectual abilities were identified with age, highlighting the importance of monitoring neurodevelopment in this population over time.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				MAR	2022	58	3					551	559		10.1037/dev0001319	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001319								35286108					WOS:000767499200020

Presence versus absence of such interactive contingency makes a difference for our theories of development. We examined whether preterm infants can contingently coordinate behaviors with mothers and fathers in spontaneous communication in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and whether mother-infant versus father-infant engagement and contingency differ. Twenty Italian preterm infants (60% girls, born 27-33 weeks, largely middle-class families) lying in a heated cot in the NICU were videotaped at 35 weeks with mothers, and fathers (counterbalanced), in face-to-face communication. Videotapes were coded on a 1-s time-base with parent and infant engagement scales. Multilevel time-series models evaluated self-contingency (auto-correlation) and interactive contingency (lagged cross-correlation). Mothers (vs. fathers) showed higher levels of engagement, interpreted as more arousing. Fathers (vs. mothers) showed more midrange engagement, interpreted as less "demanding" of infant engagement. Infants were more gaze-on-parent's-face and gaze-on-environment with mothers than fathers. Fathers interacted contingently with infants, whereas mothers did not. However, infants interacted contingently with mothers, but not fathers. When infants were in lower engagement levels 1 s prior, fathers stayed in lower engagement levels in the current second, closer to infants than mothers. We suggest that fathers were more coordinated because fathers were more able to join the infant's dampened state. We suggest that infants were more coordinated with mothers because mothers were more socially stimulating, and more familiar. We conclude that preterm infants, shortly after birth, are capable of contingent communication.					/AAA-9734-2020; Stefana, Alberto/C-5954-2016	Stefana, Alberto/0000-0002-4807-7184; Lavelli, Manuela/0000-0002-8667-1088; Beebe, Beatrice/0000-0002-2887-3853													0012-1649	1939-0599				FEB	2022	58	2					270	285		10.1037/dev0001298	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001298								35113602					WOS:000749773900008

Counterfactual Alternatives to Negative Outcomes Generated by Religious and Secular Children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Recent research has shown that a religious upbringing renders children receptive to ordinarily impossible outcomes, but the underlying mechanism for this effect remains unclear. Exposure to religious teachings might alter children's basic understanding of causality. Alternatively, religious exposure might only affect children's religious cognition, not their causal judgments more generally. To test between these possibilities, 6- to 11-year-old children attending either secular (n = 49, 51% female, primarily White and middle-class) or parochial schools (n = 42, 48% female, primarily White and middle-class) heard stories in which characters experienced negative outcomes and indicated how those characters could have prevented them. Both groups of children spontaneously invoked interventions consistent with natural causal laws. Similarly, when judging the plausibility of several counterfactual interventions, participants endorsed the intervention consistent with natural laws at high levels, irrespective of schooling. However, children's endorsement of supernatural interventions inconsistent with these laws revealed both group similarities and differences. Although both groups of children judged divine intervention (i.e., via prayer) as more plausible than mental (i.e., via wishing) and magical (i.e., via magical powers) interventions, children receiving religious (vs. secular) schooling were more likely to do so. Moreover, although children with a secular upbringing overwhelmingly chose naturalistic interventions as the most effective, children with a religious upbringing chose divine as well as naturalistic intervention. These results indicate that religious teaching does not alter children's basic understanding of causality but rather adds divine intervention to their repertoire of possible causal factors.

J	Lany, J; Thompson, A; Aguero, A				Lany, Jill; Thompson, Abbie; Aguero, Ariel			What's in a Name, and When Can a [Beep] Be the Same?	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Words influence cognition well before infants know their meanings. For example, three-month-olds are more likely to form visually based categories when exemplars are paired with spoken words than with sine-wave tones, a likely precursor to learning symbolic relations between words and their referents. However, it is unclear why words have these effects. In 3 experiments we tested the hypothesis that exaggerated "showing" gestures used when naming objects, and the resultant cross-modal synchrony between a name and object motion, can affect object categorization. Participants were 119 3-month-old infants (56 were female and 63 were male). According to caregiver report, the sample was composed of European American (N = 114) Black (N = 6), Hispanic (N = 2) and multiracial (N = 6) infants. Participants were growing up predominantly in homes with at least 1 parent who completed a college education or a higher degree (80%), and the remaining 20% completed high school. After replicating evidence that words and tones have different effects on categorization, we found that prefamiliarizing infants with tone-object synchrony leads tones to influence categorization as words do. Moreover, we found that concentrated experience with word-object synchrony enhances the effects that words themselves have on categorization. Thus, temporal structure within caregivers' communicative behaviors may lead words to facilitate categorization, and ultimately to aid in forming symbolic representations.

What Kind of Parenting Is Associated With Early Self-Control Among Toddlers Living in Poverty? The Importance of Learning Support	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The present study examined what kind of parenting best supports toddlers' self-control in the context of poverty. Parents and toddlers (52% female; M-age = 2.60 years) in 117 families (35% White, 25% Black, 22% Latinx, 15% Multiracial, and 3% Asian; M family income = $1,845/month) engaged in structured interaction tasks, and toddlers completed a snack delay task concurrently and after 6 months. Latent profile analysis based on eight observed parenting behaviors representing learning support and responsiveness/sensitivity (e.g., teaching, technical scaffolding, teamwork, instructions, choices, language use, specific praise, and warmth) identified four parenting profiles: Lower Learning Support/Lower Responsiveness, Moderate Learning Support/Moderate Responsiveness, High Responsiveness, and High Learning Support. Toddlers with parents in the High Learning Support profile demonstrated the greatest self-control 6 months later, compared with toddlers of parents in the other three profiles, and there were no statistically significant differences in self-control among toddlers of parents in those other three profiles. Results were robust even after controlling for initial levels of self-control, as well as multiple other child, parent, and family characteristics. These study findings highlight the importance of parents' learning support in understanding the early development of toddlers' self-control in the context of poverty and reinforce the need to create and refine preventive interventions in this area.

At least three hypotheses explain this "fade-out" of Pre-K effects: Pre-K does not focus on the "trifecta skills" that uniquely support subsequent learning and development; the quality of school-age experiences as "sustaining environments" are more important for Pre-K attenders than nonattenders; and kindergarten (K) teachers provide "redundant instruction" by teaching the same skills taught in preschool programs. The present sample included the second year of assessments on 455 children living in rural counties in the Southeast recruited from Pre-K classrooms and the first year of assessments for 246 K classmates without center-based preschool experience. Children's academic, language, executive function (EF), and social skills were assessed each fall and spring, and the quality of classrooms was measured each winter. Propensity scores weighted the two groups on demographic characteristics. Hierarchical linear models indicated that the Pre-K attenders had higher levels of language, academic, and EF skills than nonattenders at the beginning of K, but those differences significantly declined for academic skills. By the end of K, the Pre-K group showed slightly higher language and EF skills than the nonattenders. Results appeared to support the trifecta skills hypothesis to explain fade-out, with no evidence supporting the differential sustaining environments or redundant instruction hypotheses. Implications and the study's limitations are discussed.

Effects of a Statewide Pre-Kindergarten Program on Children's Achievement and Behavior Through Sixth Grade	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												As state-funded pre-kindergarten (pre-K) programs expand, it is critical to investigate their short- and long-term effects. This article presents the results through sixth grade of a longitudinal randomized control study of the effects of a scaled-up, state-supported pre-K program. The analytic sample includes 2,990 children from low-income families who applied to oversubscribed pre-K program sites across the state and were randomly assigned to offers of admission or a wait list control. Data through sixth grade from state education records showed that the children randomly assigned to attend pre-K had lower state achievement test scores in third through sixth grades than control children, with the strongest negative effects in sixth grade. A negative effect was also found for disciplinary infractions, attendance, and receipt of special education services, with null effects on retention. The implications of these findings for pre-K policies and practices are discussed.

J	Vaish, A; Savell, S				Vaish, Amrisha; Savell, Shannon			Young Children Value Recipients Who Display Gratitude	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Gratitude is a positive social emotion that one experiences when one has benefited from another person's goodwill (McCullough, 2002). Feeling gratitude urges the grateful person to reciprocate and respond prosocially, thereby solidifying cooperation. Yet little prior research has focused on the social functions of displaying gratitude, namely to convey that a grateful recipient is likely to be a reliable and trustworthy cooperative partner. The present study examined when in development children become sensitive to these important functions of gratitude displays. The sample consisted of 4-year-old (n = 20; 10 girls) and 5-year-old children (n = 20; 10 girls) from families in the United States that were predominantly White and college educated. Children watched videos of two beneficiaries receiving gifts from a benefactor. One beneficiary showed gratitude, whereas the other was positive but nongrateful. As predicted, 5-year-olds preferred the grateful recipient, thought the benefactor would also prefer her, thought she would be more likely to reciprocate, and distributed more resources to her. The 4-year-olds' responses showed some of the same patterns as those of the 5-year-olds but were less systematic. These findings provide the first evidence that as early as the preschool years. gratitude displays elicit affiliation and cooperation, even among bystanders, and thus serve vital social and cooperative functions.

However, DD has been associated with timing disorders as well as other motor and cognitive dysfunctions. It is still unclear whether nonverbal timing skills per se may be considered as independent determinants of DD. In this study, we investigated the independent contribution of predictive timing to DD above and beyond the motor and cognitive dysfunctions typically associated with this disorder. Twenty-one children with DD (aged 8-12, nine females) and 27 controls (14 females) were evaluated on perceptual timing, finger tapping, fine motor control, as well as attention and executive tasks. Participants were native French speakers from various socioeconomic backgrounds. The performance of children with DD was poorer than that of controls in most of the tasks. Predictors of DD, as identified by logistic regression modeling, were beat perception and precision in tapping to the beat, which are both predictive timing variables, children's tapping rate, and cognitive flexibility. These data support temporal accounts of DD in which predictive timing impairments partially explain the core phonological deficit, independent from general motor and cognitive functioning, making predictive timing a valuable tool for early diagnosis and remediation of DD.

Early Exploration of One's Own Body, Exploration of Objects, and Motor, Language, and Cognitive Development Relate Dynamically Across the First Two Years of Life	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Early exploratory behaviors have been proposed to facilitate children's learning, impacting motor, cognitive, language, and social development. This study related the performance of behaviors used to explore oneself to behaviors used to explore objects, and then related both types of exploratory behaviors to motor, language, and cognitive measures longitudinally from 3 through 24 months of age via secondary analysis of an existing dataset. Participants were 52 children (23 full-term, 29 preterm). Previously published results from this dataset documented delays for preterm relative to full-term infants in each assessment. The current results related performance among the assessments throughout the first 2 years of life. They showed that the developmental trajectories of behaviors children used for self-exploration closely related to the trajectories of behaviors they employed to explore objects. The trajectories of both self and object exploration behaviors significantly related to trajectories of children's motor, language, and cognitive development. Specifically, significant relations to global development were observed for self-exploratory head lifting, midline head and hand positioning, hand opening, and behavioral variability, as well as for object-oriented bimanual holding, mouthing, looking, banging, manipulating, transferring of objects, and behavioral intensity and variability. These results demonstrate continuity among the early exploratory behaviors infants perform with their bodies alone, exploratory behaviors with portable objects, and global development. The findings identify specific self- and object-exploration behaviors that may serve as early indicators of developmental delay and could be targeted by interventions to advance motor, language, and cognitive outcomes for infants at risk for delay.

We used behavioral observations of maternal and child behavior and maternal changes in cardiac vagal tone assessed via respiratory sinus arrhythmia in 15-s intervals during a 5-min challenging puzzle task (N = 121 dyads; 65 girls, M-age = 4.42 years). Results from multilevel models showed that increases in children's defeat (e.g., frustration, task withdrawal) coupled with maternal vagal augmentation (an index of social engagement) in a given 15-s interval predicted increases in maternal support in the next interval, whereas increases in children's defeat coupled with maternal vagal withdrawal (an index of physiological arousal) in a given 15-s interval did not predict increases in maternal support. Findings suggest that vagal augmentation in mothers may operate together with fluctuations in children's negative behaviors to predict supportive parenting in real time.

Forms of Peer Victimization in Adolescence: Covariation With Symptoms of Depression	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Peer victimization is a common concern in adolescence that includes both relational (e.g.. exclusion, rumor spreading) and overt (e.g.. hitting, threatening) forms (Crick & Bigbee, 1998). Relational and overt peer victimization have shown to be differentially associated with depressive symptoms, with relational peer victimization showing a stronger association to depressive symptoms than overt peer victimization (Casper & Card, 2017). The current study uses an accelerated longitudinal research design to investigate: (a) how relational and overt peer victimization and depressive symptoms change over an accelerated age period from 11.1 to 16.8 years (centered at 12.5 years). and (b) concurrent and prospective associations of relational and overt peer victimization with depressive symptoms. Gender differences are investigated. Participants included 1.434 adolescents in grades 7 to 9 (53.5% girls; M-age = 13.5 years. SD = .9) who were assessed over 2 school years. Adolescents were from diverse ethnic groups (45% racialized groups) and from low- to middle-income households. Adolescents reported the frequency of their experiences of relational and overt peer victimization (Crick & Grotpeter, 1996) and depressive symptoms (Bevans et al., 2012) in the fall and spring of each school year. Both forms of peer victimization and depressive symptoms increased from age 12.5 to age 14 before decreasing by age 16.8 years. Frequency of relational peer victimization at age 12.5 was related to depressive symptoms at age 16.8. Frequency of depressive symptoms at age 12.5 predicted change in both forms of peer victimization at age 16.8. Some gender differences were observed.

Early Risk Factors Associated With Preschool Developmental Patterns of Single and Co-Occurrent Disruptive Behaviors in a Population Sample	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The present study investigated prenatal and early postnatal risk factors associated with developmental patterns of disruptive behaviors (DBs; e.g., hyperactivity-impulsivity, noncompliance, physical aggression) from ages 1.5 to 5 years in a population birth cohort (N = 2,057; 50.7% boys). Six high-trajectory classes obtained by latent growth modeling were used as longitudinal indicators of single-DB and co-occurrent DBs. Children following low or moderate trajectories for all DBs served as the reference class. Results showed low commonality of risk factors among single-DB trajectory classes, suggesting that "pure" forms of DBs have specific etiologies. In contrast, the trajectory classes with a high DB in common shared 20.0% to 46.7% of their risk factors. Overall, 40.0% of significant risk factors across trajectory classes were common to between two and four classes, whereas 60.0% of the significant risk factors were specific to one class or another. However, risk factors common among classes accounted for the greater part (63.2%) of the associations, especially in co-occurrent DBs trajectory classes. These risk factors included male sex, a higher number of siblings, maternal symptoms of depression and conduct problems, young motherhood, lack of positive parenting, family dysfunction, and lower socioeconomic status. Children thus develop early distinct patterns of DBs associated with both common and specific prenatal and early postnatal risk factors. Longitudinal assessments of early manifestations of DB, including a range of behaviors and a variety of potential risk factors to reflect the distinctiveness of children and their families, could help guide etiological research, tailor early interventions, and prevent a cascade of deleterious influences and outcomes.

Building on evidence highlighting the role of parental input and guidance, the current study investigates how within-person changes in adolescent school-related communication (i.e., frequency of talking about school and educational planning) with friends and family across high school contribute to college preparedness and subsequent enrollment. Capitalizing on a diverse adolescent sample (N = 4,495), longitudinal analyses across high school showed that school-related communication with friends increased, but remained relatively stable with family, from Grades 9-12 (approximately ages 15-18 years). Parallel process latent growth curve modeling demonstrated that steeper increases in school-related communication with friends independently predicted college enrollment, consistently across racial/ethnic and parental education groups. Moreover, within-person changes in friend and family school-related communication across high school interacted in a compensatory fashion to predict grade point average and perceived college readiness at 12th grade. At a time of growing need for independence from parents, the findings highlight the positive developmental function of friends in helping adolescents reach a critical educational milestone.

The Destabilization and Destandardization of Social Roles Across the Adult Life Course: Considering Aggregate Social Role Instability and Its Variability From a Historical-Developmental Perspective	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Existing research focused on social role destabilization (historical increases in role instability) and destandardization (historical increases in variability of role instability) has primarily focused on discrete social roles during discrete periods of development. Building on this work, we applied a macro approach to elucidate the extent to which historical trends toward destabilization and destandardization are occurring at the aggregate among a key set of social roles (union formation, education, residential independence, and employment) and across the whole of adulthood. Applying a historical-developmental approach, we also document how historical trends toward destabilization and destandardization vary by age. We used 3 historical, longitudinal data sets: the Monitoring the Future study (N = 69,464; 55.4% women; 75.5% white), the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (N = 45,001; 51.4% women; 54.3% white), and The Health and Retirement Study (N = 30,913; 53.6% women; 75.6% white) that collectively cover the entire adult life course and over a century of U.S. birth cohorts. We found that aggregate destabilization and destandardization have occurred across the entirety of adulthood, although trends appear more pronounced at either end of the adult life course and the specific roles driving both trends vary across the adult life course. Findings were robust for educational attainment, and destabilization and destandardization were more pronounced among women. Findings highlight the importance of considering social role changes at the aggregate and singularly, and the need to evaluate social role changes in any 1 period of adulthood in conjunction with those occurring in other periods of adulthood.

Reexamining the Association Between the Interparental Relationship and Parent-Child Interactions: Incorporating Heritable Influences	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Family systems research has identified two key processes (spillover and compensatory), linking interparental relationship quality to the parent-child relationship. However, previous research has focused on the parent as the sole initiator and had not often considered the role of the child in these processes. The present study adds to the literature by leveraging a genetically informed design to examine possible child evocative effects on spillover and compensatory processes. Participants were from a longitudinal parent-offspring adoption sample of 361 linked sets of adoptive parents of an adopted child (57% male), and the child's birth parents. Adoptive parents reported on child pleasure and anger at 18 months and the interparental relationship at 27 months. Parent-child interactions were observed at child age 6 years, and heritable influences were assessed via birth mother self-report at 5 months. Our results indicated a dampening effect where higher interparental warmth at child age 27 months was associated with less adoptive mother-child coercion at child age 6 years, and a compensatory effect where higher interparental conflict was associated with more adoptive father-child positive engagement. Moreover, our results indicated child-driven effects via both genetic and environmental pathways. Specifically, higher levels of birth mother negative affect (heritable characteristic) were associated with lower levels of adoptive father-child coercion. Also, child anger was positively associated with interparental conflict, and child pleasure was positively associated with interparental warmth. These findings support findings from the family literature with evidence of compensatory mechanisms, while also highlighting the active role children play in shaping family interactions.

Effects of Spatial Training on Mathematics Performance: A Meta-Analysis	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Prior research has revealed robust and consistent relations between spatial and mathematical skills. Yet, establishing a causal relation has been met with mixed effects. To better understand whether, to what extent, and under what conditions mathematics performance can be improved through spatial training, we conducted a systematic meta-analysis of the extant literature. Our analysis included 29 studies that used controlled pre-post study designs to test the effects of spatial training on mathematics (N = 3,765; k = 89). The average effect size (Hedges's g) of training relative to control conditions was .28 (SE = .07). Critically, there was also evidence that spatial training improved individuals' spatial thinking (g = .49, SE = .09). Follow-up analyses revealed that age, use of concrete manipulatives, and type of transfer ("near" vs. "far") moderated the effects of spatial training on mathematics. As the age of participants increased from 3 to 20 years, the effects of spatial training also increased in size. Spatial training paradigms that used concrete materials (e.g., manipulatives) were more effective than those that did not (e.g., computerized training). Larger transfer effects were observed for mathematics outcomes more closely aligned to the spatial training delivered compared to outcomes more distally related. None of the other variables examined (training dosage, spatial gains, posttest timing, type of control group, experimental design, publication status) moderated the effects. Additionally, analyses of publication bias and selective outcome reporting were nonsignificant. Overall, our results support prior research and theoretical claims that spatial training is an effective means for enhancing mathematical understanding and performance. However, our meta-analysis also highlights a poor understanding of the mechanisms that support transfer. To fully realize the potential benefits of spatial training on mathematics achievement, more theoretically guided studies are needed.

Spatial Skills, but Not Spatial Anxiety, Mediate the Gender Difference in Number Line Estimation	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Recently, there has been increasing evidence showing that males estimate whole numbers more accurately than females on the number line. However, relatively little is known about what factors contribute to this gender gap. The current study explored potential mediators of the gender difference in number line estimation, including spatial skills and spatial anxiety. In the Fall (time-point 1 [T1]), 490 children from kindergarten through fourth grade (274 girls) completed age-appropriate measures of number line estimation, spatial skills (including proportional reasoning, mental rotation, mental transformation, and visuospatial working memory), and spatial anxiety. About 5 month later in the Spring (time-point 2 [T2]), children completed the same measure of number line estimation again. Boys were more accurate on number line estimation, proportional reasoning, and mental rotation than girls, whereas girls showed higher levels of spatial anxiety. Critically, spatial skills (a latent variable constructed from proportional reasoning, mental rotation, mental transformation, and visuospatial working memory) at T1 mediated the gender difference in T2 number line estimation whereas spatial anxiety was not a significant mediator. These relationships held even after controlling for T1 number line estimation, reading achievement, and reading anxiety. Among the four spatial skills, proportional reasoning and mental rotation (but not mental transformation or visuospatial working memory) were mediators of the gender difference in T2 number line estimation. These findings constitute, to our knowledge, the first evidence regarding factors contributing to the gender difference in whole number line estimation.

DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Although a number of social-cognitive and contextual correlates of defending against bullying have been identified, research on the personality traits associated with defending have yielded weak and inconsistent results. The current study provided a novel examination as to whether a tendency toward social withdrawal is associated with less frequent defending and whether perceived injunctive norms for defending and aggression minimize the impact of social withdrawal on defending behaviors. A sample of 1,564 children (760 girls; M-age = 10.05; 55.0% White; 36.1% Black) were followed in the fall, winter, and spring of a school year. Defending was measured with self-reports and peer-reports. Social withdrawal was measured using teacher-reports. Perceived injunctive norms were estimated by calculating within-person correlations between participants' ratings of peers' popularity and defending and between peers' popularity and aggression. Results revealed that social withdrawal was associated with less peer-reported defending in the fall, and this effect was sustained over the school year. For boys, lower levels of social withdrawal in the fall were associated with less peer-reported defending when they viewed popular peers as unlikely to defend. A temporary (i.e., fall) association was found between viewing defenders as popular and self-reported defending, and children became less likely to self-report defending over the school year if they viewed popular children as aggressive. These findings underscore the need to examine how temperamental traits and perceived contextual norms cocontribute to bystanders' behavior when witnessing bullying.

This study is a longitudinal investigation of the development of this organization during infancy. Middle-high socioeconomic status Mexican toddlers (n = 28, 15 female) were presented with a preferential looking task using an eye-tracker at 18, 21, and 24 months of age, manipulating semantic and phonological lexical links. The experimental task consisted of presenting an auditory label, which was phonologically or semantically related or unrelated, with a displayed target image. Mean proportion of target looking, time-course of fixations, pupillometry, and vocabulary network analysis were used to describe the properties of priming effects. The results showed that phonological priming developed earlier than semantic priming, and that they were produced by behavioral interference. In addition, pupil dilation showed differential use of cognitive effort in critical developmental periods. Finally, the density of vocabulary networks correlated with semantic effects, and vocabulary size and local network features with phonological effects. These findings extend our understanding of the development of the lexical-semantic system during infancy.					; Avila-Varela, Daniela Susana/GRJ-7924-2022; Arias-Trejo, Natalia/L-7790-2014; Mani, Nivedita/F-8795-2010	Angulo-Chavira, Armando/0000-0002-6756-6717; Chua-Rodriguez, Fernanda/0000-0002-3009-8438; Avila-Varela, Daniela Susana/0000-0002-3518-8117; Arias-Trejo, Natalia/0000-0002-4169-1616; Mani, Nivedita/0000-0002-9843-4629													0012-1649	1939-0599				FEB	2022	58	2					236	251		10.1037/dev0001290	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001290		DEC 2021						34941301					WOS:000733197300001

Profiles of Family-Based Social Experiences in the First 3 Years Predict Early Cognitive, Behavioral, and Socioemotional Competencies	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study utilized latent profile analyses to identify unique configurations of children's family-based social experiences during the first 3 years of life and examine differences across profiles with respect to developmental outcomes at 36 and 48 months of age. Seven family process variables were used: maternal emotional functioning, maternal sensitivity, negative controlling parenting, cognitive stimulation, corporal punishment, adult-adult aggression, and household disorganization. Data were collected by the Family Life Project (N = 1,087), a longitudinal study of families living in low-wealth, nonurban areas, for whom the biological mother was the child's primary caregiver from 6 to 36 months of age. On average, mothers were 26 years of age at 2 months of child age. Approximately 36% of the families lived below the federal poverty limit, and 41% identified as Black; 49% of children were female. Latent profile analyses identified four groups: (a) positive exposure (b) average exposure, (c) problematic adult functioning, and (d) problematic parenting . Comparisons indicate that children in the positive exposure profile had the highest levels of socioemotional and cognitive outcomes compared to overall profiles. Children in the problematic adult functioning and problematic parenting profiles had the most problematic child outcomes, with children in the problematic parenting profile scoring lowest overall. Results indicate that there is configural heterogeneity in family-based social experiences at the highest levels of risk and that exposures to problematic parenting may be more consequential for later child outcomes than exposures to problematic adult functioning in the absence of compromised caregiving.

In three studies, we investigated the scope of information (individual vs. category) Jewish-Israeli 5- and 8-year-olds prefer to receive about "real" in-group ("Jews") and out-group members ("Arabs" and "Scots") (Study 1, N = 64); the scope of information Jewish and Arab Israeli 8-year-olds prefer to receive about minimal in- and out-groups (Study 2, N = 64); and how providing such information affects children's intergroup attitudes (Study 3, N = 96). The main findings were that (a) 8-year-olds requested category information more about out-groups than in-groups, and vice-versa regarding individual information-for both, "real" and minimal groups, and (b) providing individual information about a "conflict" out-group reduced attitudinal biases. These findings highlight children's differential construal of in- and out-groups and suggest ways for remedying biases toward out-groups.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				MAR	2022	58	3					493	509		10.1037/dev0001304	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001304		DEC 2021						34941302					WOS:000733224000001

Children (N = 95; 46 girls, 49 boys; 67% White, 18% Black, 8% Latinx, 4% Asian, 3% other; median household income = $US97,810) who were 4 to 8 years old (M = 6.11 years old, SD = 1.34) were interviewed about their gender stereotypes about toy preferences, how often they engage in counterstereotypical playmate experiences, and their desire to play with peers who hold counterstereotypical toy preferences. Children with less gender stereotype-consistent expectations reported more playmate experiences with children who played with toys that were gender counterstereotypical compared to children with more gender stereotype-consistent expectations. Additionally, children with less gender stereotype-consistent expectations reported a greater desire to play with peers who held counterstereotypical toy preferences compared to children with more gender stereotype-consistent expectations. Younger children's reported playmate experiences with peers who liked toys that were gender counterstereotypical and their desire to play with these peers were strongly related to their gender stereotypical expectations (and more so than for older children). Together, these findings indicate that children's gender stereotypes and peer playmate experiences are related to their desire to play with peers who hold counterstereotypical toy preferences, highlighting the importance of facilitating diverse friendships for promoting inclusive orientations in childhood.

If so, How? A Randomized Field Experiment	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Emerging evidence suggests interventions can improve childhood self-regulation. One intervention approach that has shown promise is Taekwondo martial arts instruction, though little is known about its acceptability among stakeholders or its mechanisms of effect. We extend evidence on Taekwondo interventions in three ways: (a) testing the efficacy of a standard introductory course of Taekwondo, (b) assessing the acceptability of Taekwondo instruction among school children, and (c) investigating two self-regulatory mechanisms by which Taekwondo may operate (executive functions and motivation). This article reports findings from a randomized control trial implementing a standard 11-week beginners' course of Taekwondo. Participants were from a mixed-sex, nonselective U.K. primary school (N = 240, age range 7 to 11 years). Measures of self-regulation included teacher-rated effortful control, impulsivity, prosocial behavior, and conduct problems; computer-based assessments of executive functions; and child self-reported expectancies and values to use self-regulation. Postintervention, children in the Taekwondo condition were rated by teachers as having fewer symptoms of conduct problems and better effortful control (specifically attentional control), and they also had better executive attention assessed by a flanker task. Effects were not found for teacher-rated inhibitory control, activation control, impulsivity, and prosocial behavior or for assessments of response inhibition, verbal working memory, and switching. Taekwondo was rated very positively by children. Finally, there was evidence that children who completed Taekwondo classes reported higher expectancies and values to use self-regulation and that expectancies and values mediated intervention effects on self-regulation. We conclude that short standard Taekwondo courses are well received by pupils, improve attentional self-regulation, and reduce symptoms of conduct problems.

Intergenerational Transmission of Mastery Between Mothers and Older Offspring: Considering Direct, Moderated, and Mediated Effects	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Mastery involves a sense of having control over one's surroundings and an ability to accomplish meaningful goals and determine important meaningful outcomes across situations. Mastery is a dynamic, learned resource that has implications for mental health. Although mastery is known to be influenced by exposure to family members (i.e., parental socialization, parenting styles; provided opportunities for autonomy and choice) there remain few long-term considerations of intergenerational transmission of mastery within families and the enduring implications for offspring's mental health and adjustment. Using a nationally representative sample from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, the current study addresses the longitudinal effects of mothers' early sense of mastery on adolescent and adult offspring's mastery and well-being. In considering mothers' reports between 1987 and 1992 and offspring's ongoing reports between 1994 and 2012; this study addressed questions about direct, moderated, and mediated mother effects on longitudinal offspring outcomes. Mother mastery and mother self-esteem predicted offspring's respective reports, but only mother mastery predicted offspring depressive symptoms. Effects of mother mastery, but not mother self-esteem, were moderated by offspring age. Older offspring of high mastery mothers showed the largest benefits for reported mastery. Older offspring of low mastery mothers reported the greatest concerns with depressive symptoms. Last, effects of mother mastery on offspring depressive symptoms were mediated by offspring mastery and self-esteem. We discuss the fit of these findings with existing theories and empirical work on intergenerational transmission.

Although past research has examined concurrent correlates of parental burnout, the impacts of parental burnout on adolescent development over time remain largely unknown. The current study explored the indirect mechanisms linking mothers' parental burnout to adolescents' later internalizing and externalizing problems through maternal hostility among Chinese families. Using a sample of 606 adolescents (51.5% boys; M-age = 12.89 years old) and their mothers (M-age = 38.50 years old), this three-wave longitudinal study showed that mothers' parental burnout was predictive of adolescents' perceptions of their mothers' parental hostility over time, which were in turn related to adolescents' later internalizing and externalizing problems. Moreover, mothers' parental burnout was directly related to adolescents' later externalizing problems. Taken together, parental burnout played a role in adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems over time through increased parental hostility. These findings underscore the importance of parental burnout on parenting behavior and adolescent adjustment.

The new measure was developed using a sample of mothers and 44-month-olds (N = 171), characterizing mind-mindedness in terms of (a) solicited child involvement, (b) adaptive communication, and (c) internal state talk. These indices were positively related to established assessments of mind-mindedness at 8, 44, and 61 months. Positive associations were also observed with children's later mentalizing abilities. The new measure of mind-mindedness did not, however, mediate the relation between mind-mindedness in the first year of life and children's mentalizing abilities.

J	Xing, XP; Wei, YT; Wang, MF				Xing, Xiaopei; Wei, Yutong; Wang, Meifang			Reciprocal Relation Between Executive Function and Receptive Vocabulary in Chinese Preschoolers: Evidence From a Two-Year Longitudinal Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												By using a three-time longitudinal design, the present study focuses on three components of executive function (EF), respectively, to examine whether the relation between EF and receptive vocabulary was reciprocal and whether the direction of the above relation would differ by EF components and child gender. A total of 320 Chinese preschool children were assessed when they enrolled in preschool the first year (T1), the second year (T2) and the third year (T3), respectively. Children's EF was assessed by six computerized tasks, and receptive vocabulary was assessed by the Peabody Picture Vocabulary test (PPVT-4). Data were analyzed in the random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM). Findings provided some support for within-person reciprocal relations between EF and receptive vocabulary, but the reciprocal patterns varied depending on EF components. In specific, inhibitory control/attention shift and receptive vocabulary were reciprocally predicted between T1 and T2, and inhibitory control/attention shift at T2 could significantly predict receptive vocabulary at T3, but not vice versa. In addition, working memory and receptive vocabulary were reciprocally predicted between T1 and T2 and between T2 and T3. Finally, no child gender differences were found in the above relations. Our findings suggest that the instructions and interventions integrating EF and language skills may be an important avenue for enhancing success across skills.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				JAN	2022	58	1					83	95		10.1037/dev0000996	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000996		DEC 2021						34928629					WOS:000733144500001

DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Most cooperative interactions involve interpersonal trust and the expectation of mutual reciprocation. Thus, understanding when and how humans acquire interpersonal trust can help unveil the origins and development of children's cooperative behavior. Here, we investigated whether prior sociomoral information about trading partners modulates the choice of preschool (4-5 years) and school-age children (7-8 years) to share their own goods in a child-friendly version of the trust game. In this game, the trustee partner can repay the child's initial investment or keep everything and betray the trustor. In two studies, we addressed whether trust is modulated by trustees exhibiting prosocial versus antisocial behaviors (Study 1, "helper and hinderer"), or respect-based versus fear-based power (Study 2, "leader and bully"). Preschoolers trusted the leader reliably more than the bully, and the hinderer reliably less than a neutral agent. The tendency to trust the helper more than the hinderer increased with age as a result of the increased propensity to trust the prosocial agent. Overall, these findings indicate that, by age 5, children understand complex cooperative exchanges and start relying on sociomoral information when deciding whom to trust.

The Role of Household Chaos on Levels and Trajectories of Socioemotional Behavior in the Second Year	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The second year of life is a time of formative developmental change as basic behavioral systems undergo rapid integration and expansion. This study examined the developmental trajectories of social-emotional (SoE) outcomes and the effects of infant sex and household chaos (HC) on the development of SoE outcomes across the second year of life. The participating families (N = 143) were ethnically homogenous (88% Caucasian) but economically diverse (31% low-to-very-low income). Mothers reported on their children's SoE outcomes including externalizing, internalizing, dysregulating problem behaviors as well as SoE competence when infants (54% girls) were 12, 18, and 24 months old. At each age point, HC was assessed through observations during home visits and compliance to the study protocols. Multilevel modeling revealed increasing developmental trajectories in all of the domains of SoE outcomes across the second year of life, reflecting the premise that these behavioral systems continue to form and become increasingly part of the infant's behavioral repertoire as development unfolds. However, compared to infants in less chaotic homes, infants in more chaotic households experienced steeper increases in both externalizing and internalizing problem behaviors across the second year, and girls showed higher levels of internalizing problem behaviors compared to boys. Results emphasize the increasing trajectories of problem behaviors in relation to ongoing chaotic caregiving environment among infants as young as 2 years of age.					bai, liu/KBD-2486-2024	Chimed-Ochir, Ulziimaa/0000-0002-2773-4763; Whitesell, Corey/0000-0002-6516-778X; Teti, Douglas/0000-0002-1574-6257; Bai, Liu/0000-0001-7018-0594													0012-1649	1939-0599				FEB	2022	58	2					311	324		10.1037/dev0001297	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001297		DEC 2021						34928631					WOS:000733203600001

Cognitive Reflection and Authoritarianism Relate to How Parents Respond to Children's Science Questions	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												When children ask questions about science, parents use a variety of strategies to answer them. including providing accurate information, connecting to prior knowledge, or simply saying "I do not know." This study examines the factors underlying individual differences in parental explanatory characteristics. Parents (N = 148: M-age = 38; 84% female, 16% male: 58% with White American children; 67% having completed college; 49% with household income over $75,000) of children ages 7 to 10 answered eight questions about biology as if they were responding to their child. They also completed three measures of different aspects of reasoning and values: the Picture Vocabulary Test (PVT) to measure verbal intelligence (Gershon et al., 2013), the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT: Toplak et al., 2014), which measures the tendency to override intuitive but incorrect responses to engage in reflective thinking, and the Authoritarianism Scale (Feldman & Stenner, 1997), which measures a parent's preference for encouraging obedience toward authority figures over encouraging their child's autonomy. Our findings support that different factors are associated with different explanatory characteristics. Parents high in reflective thinking tend to provide more connections to other knowledge in their explanations, while parents high in authoritarianism tend to provide fewer references to uncertainty and how to manage it. Implications for effective parent-child communication and children's scientific understanding will be discussed.

Auditory selective attention, therefore, is a valuable tool to orient oneself, to focus on specific sound sources, and to extract relevant information. Until now, it is unknown to what extent children have developed the cognitive processes of intentional attention control in spatial situations and how they differ from adults. This work provides a paradigm to examine children's intentional switching of auditory selective attention that also allows to examine effects due to noisy and spatial sound environments presented virtually via headphones. A listening experiment was conducted in Germany with 24 children (6-10 years, 50% female) and 24 young adults (18-26 years, 50% female). First, results revealed higher error rates and lower reaction times in conditions with noise (relative to conditions without noise) for children, but not for adults. This assumes that children are more sensitive to noise and conclude faster with noise trials, taking errors into account. Second, although auditory attention flexibility reflected in attention switch and relevant information selection was comparable between children and adults, it was found that adults benefited from spatial cues when selecting the relevant information. This was not observed to the same extent in children. These results suggest that children's cognitive processes are affected at significantly lower noise levels than adults and that noise effect assessment methods should consider spatial aspects.

The sample includes adolescents sampled from public schools in a large urban area in the northeastern United States, 62% female and with an average age of 14.3 years. Multilevel analyses support an exposure effect (Model 1) where a higher level of ethnic/racial identity (ERI) commitment was associated with a 28% reduction in experiencing discrimination stress. The negative effects of discrimination were attenuated by ERI commitment and centrality/private regard, while effects were exacerbated by ERI exploration (Model 2). Two approaches investigated next-day and longer-term recovery from discrimination (Model 3). With the exception of positive mood and anxiety, the data support recovery from discrimination stress. Discrimination is discussed in the development and maintenance of health disparities.

J	Glynn, R; Salmon, K; Low, J				Glynn, Ruth; Salmon, Karen; Low, Jason			Retrieval-Induced Forgetting for Autobiographical Memories Beyond Recall Rates: A Developmental Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We investigated whether selective discussion of autobiographical memory narratives would impact the quality of young people's recall of their nondiscussed memory narratives. Children (ages 8-9 years, n = 65) and adolescents (ages 13-15 years, n = 58) completed an adapted version of the retrieval-induced forgetting (RIF) paradigm for self-generated positively and negatively valenced autobiographical memories. Overall, 54.5% of the sample were female and 63.4% were of European ethnicity (11.4% Pacific Peoples, 8.1% Middle Eastern/Latin American/African, 7.3% Maori, 7.3% Asian, 2.4% Other). We defined narrative qualities as narrative coherence (Reese et al., 2011) and episodic and nonepisodic information (Addis et al., 2008). In light of developmental findings in other domains of autobiographical memory research (e.g., Reese et al., 2011; Willoughby et al., 2012), we hypothesized that selective discussion would result in RIF for children's, but not adolescents', narrative coherence and episodic detail, and that RIF would not occur for nonepisodic details for either children or adolescents. Findings for narrative coherence and nonepisodic detail indicated support for our hypotheses. Findings for episodic detail were in partial support of our hypothesis; RIF for episodic detail was found for both children and adolescents. Our findings not only demonstrate the importance of investigating the wider effects of RIF but also uncovered developmental differences previously overlooked in the field.

In postconflict Northern Ireland, widespread residential segregation and a largely separate school system limit opportunities for intergroup contact between adolescents from the Catholic and Protestant communities. We evaluated whether a large-scale intervention to facilitate intergroup contact between students attending separate schools (the 'Shared Education' program) improves a range of outcomes relevant for intergroup relations in Northern Ireland. We conducted a 5-wave longitudinal, quasi-experimental study that followed a large sample of school students (N = 5,159, M-age = 12.4, age range: 10-14 years; 2,988 girls, 2,044 boys) from 56 predominantly Catholic or Protestant schools from sixth to tenth grade. We compared the developmental trajectories of students who, in 9th (14-15 years) and 10th (15-16 years) grade, shared some classes with students from the other community, as part of the program, to students who did not. We found that participating in shared classes had a medium-size, positive effect on the amount of intergroup contact students had outside of class, and small, positive effects on students' outgroup attitudes, outgroup trust, and intergroup empathy (but not on their intergroup anxiety, future contact intentions, deprovincialization, or multicultural beliefs). Our findings show that a school-based program of shared education can provide a viable and effective intervention to facilitate intergroup contact, improve intergroup relations, and foster social integration among adolescents at a large scale in a postconflict society.

The Effect of Parental Cell Phone Use on Parents' and Children's Question-Asking	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Although questions fuel children's learning, adult cell phone use may preoccupy parents, affecting the frequency of questions parents and children ask and answer. We ask whether parental cell phone use will lead to a decrease in the number of questions children and parents ask one another while playing with a novel toy. Fifty-seven parent-child dyads (M-age = 48.72 months, SD = 6.53, 28 girls; 84.2% White) were randomly assigned to a cell phone, paper, or control condition. As children played with a novel toy with hidden functions, parents in the cell phone condition completed a survey about reading on their cell phone, while parents in the paper condition did it on paper. Parents in the control condition did not complete the survey. Results suggest that children asked fewer questions in the cell phone than in the control condition. However, no other condition differences emerged. Parents' information-seeking questioning, however, differed in all three conditions: they asked more in the control than in the cell phone and paper conditions and, critically, asked more in the paper than cell phone condition. Possible explanations and implications for parents' cell phone use are discussed.

The Development of Template-Based Facial Expression Perception From 6 to 15 Years of Age	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												When perceiving emotional facial expressions, adults use a template-matching strategy, comparing the perceived face with a stored representation. A rejection of unnaturally exaggerated faces is characteristic of this strategy because the exaggerated expressions do not match the stored template. In contrast, a rule-based perceptual strategy (e.g., wide eyes indicate surprise) would be more tolerant of exaggeration. The current study uses exaggeration tolerance to test the expression perception strategies of children from 6 to 15 years of age. In Experiment 1, 62 (38 male) participants viewed pairs of happy or sad faces varying in exaggeration and selected the face that looked closest to how a happy (or sad) person really looks. With age, children became less likely to choose the more exaggerated expression. In Experiment 2, this result was replicated with each of the six basic emotions. Sixty-six children (26 male, 50 Caucasian, 10 mixed-race, four Indian, two unidentified) from 6 to 15 years of age completed the same experimental tasks as Experiment 1 for all six emotions. Again, with age children became less likely to choose the more exaggerated face. The results from both experiments suggest that the development of an adult-like template-matching strategy lasts into adolescence.

Substantial research has documented the communicative strategies in certain (predominantly White) United States families, yet we know little about these communicative strategies in Native American families. The current study addresses that gap by documenting the verbal and nonverbal behaviors used by parents and their 4-year-old children (N = 39, 25 boys) across two communities: Menominee families (low to middle income) living on tribal lands in rural Wisconsin, and non-Native, primarily White families (middle income) living in an urban area. Dyads participated in a free-play forest-diorama task designed to elicit talk and play about the natural world. Children from both communities incorporated actions and gestures freely in their talk, emphasizing the importance of considering nonverbal behaviors when evaluating what children know. In sharp contrast to the stereotype that Native American children talk very little, Menominee children talked more than their non-Native counterparts, underlining the importance of taking into account cultural context in child assessments. For children and parents across both communities, gestures were more likely than actions to be related to the content of speech and were more likely than actions to be produced simultaneously with speech. This tight coupling between speech and gesture replicates and extends prior research with predominantly White (and adult) samples. These findings not only broaden our theories of communicative interaction and development, but also provide new evidence about the role of nonverbal behaviors in informal learning contexts.					waxman, sandra/LUY-0990-2024	waxman, sandra/0000-0002-5009-2068; Novack, Miriam/0000-0003-0522-0371; Standley, Murielle/0000-0001-8988-7274; Bang, Megan/0000-0001-7364-469X													0012-1649	1939-0599				JAN	2022	58	1					32	42		10.1037/dev0001279	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001279		DEC 2021						34881968					WOS:000733092100001

However, in diglossic languages, like Arabic, the large gap between the spoken and the formal, modern standard (MSA) varieties of the language may restrict the benefits of oral language proficiency to subsequent literacy skills. Here, we tested, in a randomized controlled study, whether an intervention program, implemented in kindergarten, that familiarized the children with rhymes presented in MSA through recitation, facilitated reading and spelling in first grade. We also tested whether engaging the children in recitation affords an advantage over repeated listening by itself and whether rhymes directly referring to the alphabet impart additional advantages. The children were assigned to one of four intervention conditions (10 sessions, 2 months) wherein they either recited or repeatedly listened to nursery rhymes that were either related or unrelated to the alphabet, or engaged in nonlinguistic activities (control). A year later, all intervention groups read faster compared to a control group (nonlinguistic activity). The two recitation groups gained in reading accuracy, reading efficiency, and spelling; spelling gains were found also in children who only listened to alphabet-related rhymes. The reciting groups were superior to the listening groups in all study measures (reading and spelling). The results suggest long-term contributions from structured interventions based on oral rhyme repetition, in kindergarten, to reading and spelling in first grade. Vocal recitations in kindergarten can benefit the mastering of literacy skills even in a language that differs from the one spoken in the child's home.

Examination of Chinese Immigrant Parents' Beliefs About Children's Social Development Through Play: A Mixed Methods Explanatory Sequential Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Currently, despite the rapid growth of the population of Chinese immigrant families and children in the United States, preschool-aged Chinese-heritage children are an underrepresented group in research. The overarching purpose of this project was to provide a deeper understanding of Head Start Chinese immigrant parents' beliefs about children's social-emotional development, the value of play during the preschool period, and the potential role of cultural orientation. The study followed the steps of a mixed methods explanatory sequential design. First, using quantitative data collected from 213 primary caregivers, the study employed a person-centered lens to explore profiles of parents' cultural orientations and beliefs about play and academics in preschool to better understand the association of these profiles to children's social competencies. Next, 34 primary caregivers from the quantitative study participated in in-depth, focus group discussions to further explore parents' perceptions of children's social behaviors, cultural adjustment experiences, and their perceptions about U.S. preschools. Four reliable profiles were resolved quantitatively and showed within-group variations in patterns of Chinese immigrant parents' beliefs and cultural orientations that related differentially to children's social-emotional competencies as evidenced within peer play at home. Qualitative findings corroborated and elaborated the quantitative findings. These results underscored the importance of engaging with Chinese immigrant parents to inform research and program practices.

To date, only polynomial growth models have been fit to model cognitive recovery across childhood, limiting the applicability of the growth parameters to later developmental periods. We fit a nonlinear asymptotic Gompertz growth model to prospective cognitive scores from 1,153 individual twins from 578 families (47.9% male, 91.5% White, 61.6% monozygotic) measured at 16 time points between 3 months and 15 years. Twins displayed a lower asymptote of 86.47 (.90 SD below the population mean) and gained on average 17.01 points, achieving an upper asymptote of 103.48. Growth was observed to be most rapid at 3.26 years, highlighting the importance of the toddler years in cognitive development. Biometric analyses revealed that shared environmental factors accounted for the majority of the variance in initial cognitive ability as well as asymptotic growth in cognitive ability. Gestational age and family socioeconomic status (SES) were robust predictors of cognitive growth. Results from the present study provide insight into the growth processes underlying the recovery of cognitive ability to the population mean for children evincing slight delays in their initial cognitive ability. In particular, findings highlight prenatal factors and family economic resources as important aspects of the environment in the recovery of cognitive ability.

We relied on a multinomial processing tree model to compare the processes underlying EC in middle-aged children (n = 57, M-age = 8.65, range = 6.94-11.03; 31 females) and young adults (n = 57, M-age = 19.16, range = 17.60-23.60; 53 females). We found that controllable and uncontrollable valence transfer processes concurrently contributed to EC in adults and provided initial evidence that they are already present in children. Moreover, the experiment revealed that both types of processes are weaker in children than in adults and that controllable processes are stronger in older children than in younger ones. These findings suggest that both controllable and uncontrollable processes already underlie EC in middle-aged children but that they continue to mature after childhood.

J	Bukowski, WM; Troop-Gordon, W				Bukowski, William M.; Troop-Gordon, Wendy			Replication Studies of Critical Findings From the Peer Literature: An Introduction	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Despite its importance, replication has remained in the background of social development research. The aim of this special section was to elucidate and elevate the role of replication in peer relations research, examining its challenges and its utility for moving the field forward. To accomplish this aim, five sets of researchers undertook identifying an important finding from a widely cited article in the peer literature and tried to replicate its basic results using new data. As a group, the resulting five articles cover a broad range of topics, measures, and methods that are seen in peer research. Four of the five articles provide evidence of replication. This evidence was seen more for basic principles or processes observed in earlier studies than for exact or specific findings. In addition, the authors used varied approaches to replication, highlighting the need to embrace diverse methods when attempting to replicate complicated mechanisms of social development. It is argued that replication efforts should be aimed at identifying basic principles and processes of social development while clarifying the parameters that account for variability across studies in the specific findings.

(2009) and Hou et al. (2013) findings by determining the contribution of peers' deviance to changes in participants' (monozygotic [MZ] twins') self-reported delinquency from mid- to late adolescence while controlling for possible gene-environment correlations (rGE) through the use of the cotwin method in the context of a cross-lagged design. Two separate samples were used to this purpose. The first sample included 289 MZ-twin pairs (48.42% female; 65.5% of European descent, 21.7% of African descent, 12.8% other; average age at first assessment = 16.20 years) and relied on perceived measures of peer deviance, as in the two original studies. The second sample comprised 181 MZ-twin pairs (50.67% female; 84% of European descent, 3% of African descent, 2% of Asian descent, 2% Native North Americans, and 9% unspecified; average age at first assessment = 13.05 years) and used direct measures to assess peers' deviance. Participants in the first sample were part of a large representative sample of American adolescents, whereas the second sample included families with twins born in a large Canadian city. Results showed that within-pair differences in self-reported delinquency were stable from midadolescence to late adolescence in both samples. As in Burt et al. (2009) and Hou et al. (2013) within-pair differences in peer deviance did not predict changes in within-pair differences in self-reported delinquency in both samples (i.e., no socialization effect). In contrast to Burt et al. (2009) and Hou et al. (2013), however, we found no predictive link from twins' self-reported delinquency to peers' deviance (i.e., no selection effect). Finally, as in Burt et al. (2009) we found that peers' deviance was stable from middle to late adolescence and that peers' deviance and participants' delinquency were cross-sectionally correlated in the first sample, but not in the second sample. These results are interpreted in the context of the ongoing debate in regard to peers' socialization vs selection effects.

Colombia (N = 449) and Montreal, Canada (N = 331) were used to replicate findings reported by Valdivia et al. (2005). This prior study revealed contextual variations in the association between two measures of social behavior, specifically aggression and withdrawal, and two measures of effective functioning with peers. specifically sociometric preference and friendship. The Montreal participants were primarily from families with European backgrounds. The ethnicity of the participants from Barranquilla can be described as Latinx/Caribbean. Multilevel analyses provided evidence of replication of place differences only for the associations between measures of aggression and sociometric preference. Stronger negative associations were observed between (a) measures of aggression and sociometric preference, (b) measures of withdrawal and sociometric preference. and (c) withdrawal and friendship in peer groups that were high in collectivism. These findings are interpreted as largely replicating the deep structure of the findings from the Valdivia et al. study.

(1995) social process model were reexamined with two longitudinal samples using both the original and contemporary analytic strategies. Study goals included reconstructing (e.g., quasireplicating) Boivin et al.'s (1995) original findings and evaluating hypothesized relations across both comparable and longer developmental epochs. Samples included 491 children (245 girls, M-age = 10.0; 80.1% White;19.1% low-, 43.1% middle- or higher-income) followed from grades 4 to 12 and 272 children (148 girls, M-age = 9.61; 84.2% White; 8.2% low-, 17.1% middle-, 74.7% upper middle to higher-income) followed from grades 4 to 5. The assumption that social withdrawal instigates a cascade of within-person changes in the quality of peer relationships, sense of loneliness and social dissatisfaction, and depression was evaluated using Boivin et al.'s (1995) original regression strategy plus two variants of cross-lagged panel models (classical CLPM; Latent Curve Model with Structured Residuals [LCM-SR]). Unlike classical CLPM, LCM-SR allowed for isolating within-person changes and testing hypothesized predictors of within-person increases and decreases. Results differed by type of analysis. Regression and classical CLPM yielded greater substantiation for some of the processes stipulated by Boivin et al. (1995). LCM-SR results, however, called into question the assumption of a cascade effect of early social withdrawal and the reliance on traditional regression and CLPM analyses to test for presumed predictors of within person change.

In 2004, Bellmore et al. applied this theory to the ethnic composition and social climate of the classroom. The current study tested whether their findings replicate with a slightly younger, rural sample from the Southeastern United States, whether associations held longitudinally, and whether child ethnicity moderated effects. Participants were 4th-grade and 5th-grade students from 13 elementary schools (N = 1,448; M-age = 10.13 years; 701 girls; 37.9% Black, 4.40% Latina/o, 57.7% White). Measures included peer-reports of peer victimization, teacher-reports of loneliness, social withdrawal, and anxiety, and self-reports of prosocial peer treatment. Classroom social disorder was assessed using teacher-reports of aggressive behavior and peer victimization. Evidence that having a large percentage of same-ethnicity peers amplifies peer victimization-adjustment linkages was limited. Although the exact nature of identified interactive effects somewhat varied from Bellmore et al., findings similarly underscored the benefits of low social disorder and ethnically diverse classrooms. Together, these findings point to a need to understand the proximal sociostructural impact of ecological factors when studying the consequences of peer victimization.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				DEC	2021	57	12					2050	2066		10.1037/dev0001161	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001161								34928658					WOS:000731155100014

Revisiting the Hypothesis That Friends Buffer Against Diminished Self-Esteem Arising From Poor Quality Parent-Adolescent Relationships: A Replication Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This replication study revisited conclusions from 2 previous investigations (Gauze. Bukowski, Aquan-Assee, & Sippola. 1996; van Aken & Asendorpf. 1997), which suggested that support from friends buffers against diminished self-esteem arising from poor quality relationships with mothers during the transition into adolescence. The aim of this replication study was to conduct an independent test of these findings with both concurrent and longitudinal data. Concurrent data for replication analyses were drawn from 4 projects, involving a total of 959 boys and 1,119 girls (ages 10 to 14) from Canada and the United States. Three samples reported participant ethnic descent: Africa (12.1%). Asia (5.6%). Europe (65.3%), Latin America (12.1%), and Native North America (0.991). Child and mother reports of mother-child relationship quality assayed (a) maternal social support (in 3 data sets). and (b) family cohesion and adaptability (in 2 data sets). Main effects were replicated but hypothesized buffering effects were not. Maternal social support and friend social support were independently associated with adolescent self-esteem, concurrently, but not longitudinally. Family cohesion (but not adaptability) was associated with adolescent self-esteem, concurrently and longitudinally. Friend social support did not moderate associations between mother-child relationship quality and adolescent self-esteem. concurrently or longitudinally. The findings are consistent with a cumulative effects model wherein friends uniquely contribute to adolescent self-worth. over and above the contribution of mothers.

J	Sabato, H; Kogut, T				Sabato, Hagit; Kogut, Tehila			Sharing and Belonging: Children's Social Status and Their Sharing Behavior With In-Group and Out-Group Members	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The association between children's social-status within their peer-group and their prosociality was examined among fourth and sixth graders (N = 276), using sociometric nominations, and actual sharing with a fellow in-group member, or a member of an out-group. Results show an overall increase in sharing with age, and an overall correlation between children's social status among peers and their sharing behavior-however, across both age groups, this association was significant only in the in-group condition, not when the recipient child was an out-group member. Specifically, less accepted children behaved in a less prosocial manner only toward in-group members, not toward out-group ones. This suggests that situational factors and characteristics of the prospective recipient play an important part in the degree to which less socially accepted children are willing to act prosocially.

Examining Transactional Relations Between Behavioral Self-Regulation and Social-Emotional Functioning During the Transition to Kindergarten	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The present study examined longitudinal associations between behavioral self-regulation and social-emotional functioning across four waves of measurement during the transition from preschool to kindergarten in a low-income sample. Participants included two cohorts of children (N = 558; 51% male). Children in both cohorts were 4 years old (Cohort 1: M = 4.82 years, SD = .31; Cohort 2: M = 4.80 years, SD = .31). Forty-four percent of children were Black, 32% were White, 13% were Latino, 10% were Multiracial, and 1% were Asian. Monthly income ranged from $0-5,539 (M = $1,508.18, SD = $892.92). Two statistical methods were used to examine relations among constructs. The cross-lagged panel model revealed a mixed pattern of relations between behavioral self-regulation and two indicators of social-emotional functioning (social skills and behavior problems) over time. There were no significant relations among behavioral self-regulation and social-emotional functioning during the preschool year; however, evidence for bidirectional associations were found between the spring of preschool and the fall of kindergarten. There were no significant relations among behavioral self-regulation and behavior problems at any time point. Finally, there were bidirectional relations among social skills and behavior problems in preschool, but directional relations emerged after this time point. A second model that included random intercepts was also run with the cross-lagged paths. Results from this model indicated that the random intercepts between behavioral self-regulation, social skills, and behavior problems were significantly related. Implications for future research are discussed.

J	Fisk, E; Lombardi, CM				Fisk, Eleanor; Lombardi, Caitlin McPherran			Are Math and Behavioral Skills Interrelated? A Longitudinal Analysis in Early Childhood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The interrelationships between math and behavioral skill development prior to school entry are not well understood, yet have important implications for understanding how to best prepare young children for kindergarten. This study addresses this gap by utilizing a sample of 1,750 children (53% male; 47% White, 16% Black, 16% Hispanic, 8% Asian, and 13% other or multirace) from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) to examine the interrelationships between behavioral (parent-reported prosocial skills and externalizing problems) and math skills (directly assessed) across the ages of 4, 5, and 6 years. Results from a random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RICLPM) revealed significant between-person associations between each of these skills over time. After controlling for these between-person differences, findings identified several significant within-person associations both between and within domains, with prosocial skills at age 4 predicting both prosocial and math skills at age 5. At age 5, math skills were predictive of future math and prosocial skills at age 6. Externalizing problems were not significantly associated with either of the other skills at any time points, but did predict continued externalizing problems from ages 5 to 6. Findings highlight the importance of supporting children's prosocial and math skills in conjunction with one another during early childhood prior to school entry.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				DEC	2021	57	12					2106	2118		10.1037/dev0001273	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001273								34928662					WOS:000731155100019

Executive Functions and Science Achievement During the Five-to-Seven-Year Shift	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Executive functions (EF) are domain-general cognitive skills that predict foundational academic skills such as literacy and numeracy. However, less is known about the relation between EFs and science achievement. The nature of this relation might be explained by the theory of mutualism, which states that development is the result of complex and interacting processes, in which growth in one domain influences growth in another domain. The present study examined the bidirectional associations between science achievement and children's cognitive flexibility and working memory in a nationally representative sample of children in the United States (Early Childhood Longitudinal Study: Kindergarten Class of 2010-2011 [ECLS-K:2011]; N = 18,174). Using random intercepts cross-lagged panel modeling, results revealed a heterogeneous pattern of associations between EF and science achievement, consistent with mutualism theory. Trait-like and construct stability emerged in the between-person and within-person estimates of EF and science. Cognitive flexibility and working memory in kindergarten each predicted science achievement in first grade. Science achievement at the beginning of first grade predicted cognitive flexibility at the end of first grade. There were also bidirectional associations between working memory and science achievement from the beginning to the end of the first grade year. Although effect sizes were small, findings reveal the complex interplay between EF and science achievement during early childhood and highlight a core tenet of mutualism theory-that small gains in academic and cognitive domains are positively associated with future skills and abilities within and across domains.

Participants were African American, Asian, Latinx, and White youth recruited at the start of middle school in 6th grade (N = 4,361; M-age = 11.33 years) and followed across the 3 years of middle school. School racial/ethnic diversity and the racial/ethnic representation of students in their academic classes, including honors classes, were examined as predictors of friendship preferences over time. Results from latent growth curve models revealed that same-race friendship preference increased over the course of middle school and was shaped by both the school and classroom racial/ethnic context, above and beyond availability. Greater school racial/ethnic diversity predicted steeper increases in same-race friendship preference over time for all racial/ethnic groups. However, there were interactions involving race/ethnicity when the analyses focused on how students were represented in their academic classes compared with school. African American and Asian youth who were underrepresented in honors classes showed steeper increases in same-race friendship preference over time. Implications for prejudice reduction and creating more inclusive school environments are discussed.

Testimony Bias Lingers Across Development Under Uncertainty	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Children have a powerful ability to track probabilistic information, but there are also situations in which young learners simply follow what another person says or does at the cost of obtaining rewards. This latter phenomenon, sometimes termed bias to trust in testimony, has primarily been studied in children preschool-age and younger, presumably because reasoning capacities improve with age. Less attention has been paid to situations in which testimony bias lingers-one possibility is that children revert to a testimony bias under conditions of uncertainty. Here, participants (4 to 9 years old) searched for rewards and received testimony that varied in reliability. We find support for testimony bias beyond preschool-age, particularly for uncertain testimony. Children were sensitive to trial-by-trial uncertainty (Experiment 1: N = 102, 59 boys, 43 girls; the sample included nine Hispanic/Latinx, 93 non-Hispanic/Latinx participants, of whom six were Black/African American, seven were Asian American, eight were multiracial, 77 were White, and four indicated "other" or did not respond), and with uncertainty defined as a one-time, unexpected change in the testimony (Experiment 3: N = 129; 68 boys, 61 girls; the sample included 12 Hispanic/Latinx, 117 non-Hispanic/Latinx [10 Black/African American, four Asian American, nine multiracial, 103 White, and three "other"]). However, the impact of the testimony bias decreased with age. These effects were specific to the testimony coming from another person as opposed to resulting from a computer glitch (Experiment 2: N = 89, 52 boys, 37 girls; five Hispanic/Latinx, 80 non-Hispanic/Latinx, of whom one was Black/African American, three were Asian American, 15 were multiracial, 66 were White, and four did not report race). Taken together, these experiments provide evidence of a disproportionate influence of testimony, even in children with more advanced reasoning skills.

Family Context in Association With the Development of Child Sensory Processing Sensitivity	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Informed by the biological sensitivity to the context (BSC) theory, this multimethod, longitudinal study sought to examine how family context may be associated with the development of child sensory processing sensitivity (SPS) over a year. Participants were 235 young children (M-age = 2.97 at the first measurement occasion, 55.3% were girls) and their parents (median annual household income: $55,000 to 74,999), who were followed for two annual measurement occasions. These children consisted of 56.2% White, 21.3% African American, and 16.2% mixed race. Child SPS was measured via behavioral observation within multiple laboratory tasks at both waves and exhibited moderate stability over time. A curvilinear association between environmental harshness and the change in child SPS emerged, which proved consistent with the U-shaped pattern hypothesized by the BSC theory. Children remain at similar levels of SPS over the year under low and high levels of environmental harshness but exhibited decreases in SPS under moderate levels of environmental harshness. A follow-up exploration for the developmental implication of SPS change showed that children with higher SPS benefited more from the supportive environment by developing greater cognitive and behavioral functioning.

Beyond Destructive and Constructive Interparental Conflict: Children's Psychological Vulnerability to Interparental Disorganization	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Guided by models of family unpredictability, this study was designed to identify the distinctive sequelae of disorganized interparental conflict, a dimension of interparental conflict characterized by abrupt, inexplicable changes in parental emotional lability, conflict tactics, and verbalizations. Participants included 208 kindergarten children (M age = 5.74 years; 56% girls), mothers, and their caregiving partners from racially diverse backgrounds (e.g., 44% Black) who participated in a longitudinal study with two annual measurement occasions. At Wave 1, trained observers assessed disorganized interparental conflict. Observational and survey assessments were used to assess several family (i.e., interparental conflict, parenting difficulties, parent psychopathology, family instability) and demographic (i.e., children's gender, household income, parent education) characteristics. Assessments of child functioning at each wave included psychological adjustment (i.e., externalizing and internalizing symptoms, prosocial behavior), social information processing difficulties, and attention to emotion cues. Findings from structural equation modeling analyses indicated disorganized interparental conflict significantly predicted decreases in children's prosocial behavior and increases in their externalizing problems, angry reactivity to social problems, and biased attention to angry and sad cues over a one-year period. Results were significant while controlling for established measures of interparental conflict, parenting difficulties, parent psychopathology, family instability, and demographic characteristics. The findings suggest that disorganized characteristics of interparental conflict may be an important domain of clinical change beyond the established targets of family harshness and adversity.

To demonstrate that the assessment of children's caregiving context is an often neglected, but crucial prerequisite for attachment studies, we (a) conducted a literature analysis of attachment research in non-Western contexts and (b) empirically investigated the caregiving arrangements and cultural concepts of attachment figures in three cultural groups in Costa Rica: rural Guanacaste, urban San Jose, and rural indigenous Bribri. All persons involved in caring for 65 infants (7-20 months) participated in the study, resulting in a total of 179 semistructured interviews. The samples showed differences in caregiving practices, with the urban sample resembling Western middle-class contexts emphasizing the maternal importance; the two rural samples showing extensive caregiving networks; however, differently composed. Moreover, the three samples revealed culturally specific concepts of potential attachment figures. The study emphasizes the need for culturally sensitive conceptual and methodological approaches in attachment research.

A Longitudinal Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												To examine whether implicit social cognition is developmentally stable or variable, this study investigated three primary types of implicit social cognition (self-esteem, the gender-science stereotype, and racial attitude) across 2 years in a sample of Chinese adolescents and emerging adults (N = 608; 56% female; 15- to 27-year-olds). Rank-order stability analyses indicated that implicit self-esteem and implicit racial attitude manifested low stability (r = .16, .19, respectively), whereas implicit gender-science stereotype was highly stable (r = .75). Latent change score model analyses showed that: (a) the mean level of implicit self-esteem decreased across the 2 years, whereas the mean levels of implicit gender-science stereotype and implicit racial attitude manifested no changes; (b) individual changes were heterogeneous for all the three types of implicit social cognition (while some of the participants manifested increasing tendencies, 15%-46%, the others exhibited decreasing tendencies); (c) 30% of participants manifested similar changes across the three types of implicit social cognition (either increasing or decreasing over time on all three), while the remaining participants exhibited distinct changes across them. Together, these findings indicate that, developmentally, implicit social cognition is variable but also stable, though the degree of variability and stability vary across individuals and domains.					li, xin/HHS-9461-2022	Cai, Huajian/0000-0001-5575-4158; luo, yu/0000-0002-8595-5265													0012-1649	1939-0599				DEC	2021	57	12					2220	2233		10.1037/dev0001255	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001255								34928670					WOS:000731155100029

Data were drawn from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (NICHD SECCYD) and included a diverse sample (52% male at birth; 76% White; 13% Black; 6% Hispanic; and 5% other; 14.23 mean years of maternal education) of 1,364 participants born in 1991 and followed through age 26. Four main findings emerged. First, we observed significant bivariate relations between EF measured at 54 months and adult educational attainment (r = .36, p < .01), and impulse control (r = .11, p = .01). Second, early EF measured during preschool and childhood explained variance in adult educational attainment and impulse control above and beyond adolescent EF. Third, childhood EF mediated the association between preschool EF and adult educational attainment and impulse control but did not operate through adolescent EF. Finally, neither preschool EF nor EF measured at other developmental stages predicted health during adulthood. Together, these findings shed light on the direct and cascading influences of EF across development on important domains of adult functioning.

The Externalizing and Internalizing Pathways to Marijuana Use Initiation: Examining the Synergistic Effects of Impulsiveness and Sensation Seeking	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Adolescent marijuana use has become increasingly more problematic compared with the past; thus, understanding developmental processes that increase the liability of marijuana use is essential. Two developmental pathways to adolescent substance use have been proposed: an externalizing pathway that emphasizes the expression of aggressive and delinquent behavior, and an internalizing pathway that emphasizes the role of depressive symptoms and negative affect. In this study, we aimed to examine the synergistic role of impulsiveness and sensation seeking in the two risk pathways to determine whether both high and low levels of the traits are risk factors for marijuana use. Our study included 343 adolescents (52% were girls, 78% identified as Hispanic) that oversampled high-risk youth (78% had a family history of substance use disorder), assessed biannually between the ages of 13-16 years old. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that high levels of sensation seeking indirectly predicted marijuana use through higher mean levels of externalizing behavior. The positive relationship between sensation seeking and externalizing behavior was only significant at high levels of impulsiveness. Conversely, low levels of sensation seeking indirectly predicted marijuana use through higher mean levels of internalizing behavior. The negative relationship between sensation seeking and internalizing behavior was only significant at low levels of impulsiveness. Collectively, these results demonstrate that high and low levels of both impulsiveness and sensation seeking confer increased risk of marijuana use, albeit through different mechanisms.

Most studies have examined identity development focusing on how individuals develop their identities (identity process), such as identity exploration and commitment. Meanwhile, researchers have emphasized incorporating the what of identity development (identity content) with identity processes to further the understanding of identity development in sociocultural contexts. This study focuses on the positive and negative valences of identity defined by desirable and undesirable images shared in sociocultural contexts. We investigated the bidirectional associations of identity exploration and commitment processes with positive and negative identity elements using longitudinal data over three measurement waves. Participants were 2,313 Japanese emerging adults enrolled in higher education (70.95% women; M-age = 20.43). The cross-lagged panel analysis and random-intercept cross-lagged panel analysis were used to estimate associations at both between- and within-person levels. Results indicated that commitment making negatively predicted negative identity elements, whereas identification with commitment positively predicted positive identity elements. Meanwhile, positive identity elements positively predicted identification with commitment only for participants with low levels of negative identity elements, while negative identity elements negatively predicted commitment making and identification with commitment. These associations were found only at the between-person level. The findings highlight that emerging adults develop identities through close interactions in which they engage in identity exploration and commitment processes, as well as construct identity content valences. Developmental sequences of identity, along with their sociocultural contexts and practical implications, are discussed.

Wall; Steinberg, Laurence; Cauffman, Elizabeth			The Associations of Maternal Warmth and Hostility With Prosocial and Antisocial Outcomes in Justice-Involved Adolescents	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Parental warmth and hostility are two key dimensions of parenting for child development, but the differential effects of these parenting dimensions on child prosocial and antisocial development has not been adequately investigated. The current study hypothesized that parental warmth would be uniquely related to child callous-unemotional traits and prosocial behavior, whereas parental hostility would be uniquely related to child delinquency and aggression. These hypotheses were investigated in a diverse sample of 1,216 adolescent males (13 to 17 years old, 46% Latino, 37% Black) with justice-system involvement in the 5 years following their first arrest. Hybrid models estimated within- and between-individual associations over time, while controlling for the overlap between parental warmth and hostility and between child prosocial and antisocial outcomes. Results indicated that maternal warmth showed consistent associations with callous-unemotional traits and prosocial behavior over time, whereas maternal hostility showed consistent associations with delinquency and aggression over time. Further, the findings were similar across racial and ethnic groups. Implications for developmental models of antisocial behavior, particularly for those including the role of callous-unemotional traits, are discussed.

Cascades in Action: How the Transition to Walking Shapes Caregiver Communication During Everyday Interactions	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												New motor skills supply infants with new possibilities for action and have consequences for development in unexpected places. For example, the transition from crawling to walking is accompanied by gains in other abilities-better ways to move, see the world, and engage in social interactions (e.g., Adolph & Tamis-LeMonda, 2014). Do the developmental changes associated with walking extend to the communicative behaviors of caregivers? Thirty infants (14 boys, 16 girls; 93% White, not Hispanic or Latino) and their caregivers (84% held a college degree or higher) were observed during everyday activities at home during the two-month window surrounding the onset of walking (M infant age = 11.98 months, range = 8.74-14.86). Using a cross-domain coding system, we tracked change in the rates of co-occurrence between infants' locomotor actions and caregivers' concurrent language and gesture input. We examined these relations on two timescales-across developmental time, as infants transitioned from crawling to walking, and in real time based on moment-to-moment differences in infant posture. A consistent pattern of results emerged: compared to crawling, bouts of infant walking were more likely to co-occur with caregiver language and gestures that either requested or described movement or provided information about objects. An effect of infants' real-time behavior was also discovered, such that infants were more likely to hear language from their caregivers when they moved while upright compared to prone. Taken together, findings suggest that the emergence of walking reorganizes the infant-caregiver dyad and sets in motion a developmental cascade that shapes the communication caregivers provide.

Heterotypic Continuity of Inhibitory Control in Early Childhood: Evidence From Four Widely Used Measures	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Inhibitory control has been widely studied in association with social and academic adjustment. However, prior studies have generally overlooked the potential heterotypic continuity of inhibitory control and how this could affect assessment and understanding of its development. In the present study, we systematically considered heterotypic continuity in four well-established measures of inhibitory control, testing two competing hypotheses: (a) the manifestation of inhibitory control coheres within and across time in consistent, relatively simple ways, consistent with homotypic continuity. Alternatively, (b) with developmental growth, inhibitory control manifests in more complex ways with changes across development, consistent with heterotypic continuity. We also explored differences in inhibitory control as a function of the child's sex, language ability, and the family's socioeconomic status. Children (N = 513) were studied longitudinally at 30, 36, and 42 months of age. Changes in the patterns of associations within and among inhibitory control measures across ages suggest that the measures' meanings change with age, the construct manifests differently across development, and, therefore, that the construct shows heterotypic continuity. We argue that the heterotypic continuity of inhibitory control motivates the use of different combinations of inhibitory control indexes at different points in development in future research to improve validity. Confirmatory factors and growth curves also suggest that individual differences in inhibitory control endure, with convergence among inhibitory control measures by 36 months of age.

J	Bialecka-Pikul, M; Bialek, A				Bialecka-Pikul, Marta; Bialek, Arkadiusz			Developmental Continuity in Coordination of Perspectives as an Alternative to the Implicit and Explicit Theory of Mind Controversy	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The dichotomy between explicit and implicit theory of mind remains controversial. This study proposed a developmental and social-constructionist perspective that challenges this notion through a model showing that coordination of perspectives (CoP) is a continuously developing ability in children. Our tested model comprises eight distinct abilities that emerge sequentially. We tested our model using 25 different tasks in a longitudinal six-wave study with 300 native Polish children aged from 1 year (M-T1 = 1 year 0 months; SDT1 = 1.73 weeks; 44% girls) to 3.5 years (M-T6 = 3 years 6 months; SDT6 = 1.81 weeks; 45% girls). All children were Caucasian; both parents of 54% children had university degree. Structural equation modeling with factor scores for each of the eight abilities was used to verify the fit of obtained data. We provide preliminary support for distinguishing six abilities: (a) immediate social perspective-tracking and taking at age of 1 year, (b) deferred social perspective-tracking and visual perspective-taking as an intermediate step at age of 2 years, and (c) epistemic perspective-tracking and taking at 3.5 years. Using our new nomenclature-emphasizing the function of coordination of own and another person perspective in social situations-we found that development of mindreading begins when infants coordinate their bodily-expressed orientations with those of others, and by the age of 4 is manifested by coordinating own and others mental states. Thus, we support the idea of heterotypic continuity of mindreading development. Development of CoP and difference between perspective-tracking and taking should be further elucidated.

J	Wan, YJ; Zhu, LQ				Wan, Yingjia; Zhu, Liqi			Effects of Rhythmic Turn-Taking Coordination on Five-Year-Old Children's Prosocial Behaviors	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Rhythmic activities such as joint music-making and synchronous moving are known to produce prosocial effects in both adults and children, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. One possible mechanism is that the time-locked, fine-grained coordination characteristic of rhythmic activities plays a key role in producing powerful prosocial effects. The present study investigated how coordination in a joint music-making task would influence kindergarteners' prosociality toward both coperformers and unaffiliated strangers. The study involved 138 Chinese children (72 girls, M = 5 years and 6 months, range = 5.0 to 6.0 years) from urban middle-class families. Participants were paired and instructed to play percussion instruments in alternation accompanying a song. In the fine-grained coordination condition, the dyad alternated every measure, resulting in a moment-to-moment coordinative experience; in the coarse-grained coordination condition where the coordination was sparser, the dyad alternated every eight measures. Children in the fine-grained coordination condition were subsequently more willing to help their partner complete a block-assembly task and more generous in sharing stickers with unknown children in a dictator game, compared with children in the coarse-grained coordination condition. These findings demonstrate that fine-grained coordination in rhythmic activities increases prosociality above and beyond having a shared goal of coperforming, supporting that coordination is an integral part of the prosocial mechanism. The prosocial effects of joint rhythmic activities generalized beyond the coperformers to anonymous strangers, indicating that the role of coordination may change from directing specific bonding in infancy to encouraging general prosociality from early childhood and onward.

This study used a randomized controlled trial to examine the intervention effects of TIK on Chinese parents of low to middle socioeconomic status in Hong Kong. One hundred four parents (99 mothers and five fathers; M-age in years = 37.92) of preschoolers aged 3-6 years were randomly assigned to the experimental (n = 54) or waitlist control group (n = 50). Parent and child outcomes were assessed at baseline (Time 1), immediately after the 6-week intervention (Time 2), and 6 weeks postintervention (Time 3), using the Alabama Parenting Questionnaire, Coping with Children's Negative Emotions Scale, Parenting Stress Index-Short Form, and Emotion Regulation Checklist. The experimental group reported significant reductions in punitive parenting and parenting stress at Time 2, and these effects were maintained at Time 3. Delayed improvements in parents' use of expressive encouragement and children's emotion lability/negativity were observed at Time 3 in the experimental group. The immediate intervention effects were replicated in the waitlist control group at Time 3 after they attended the training. This study represented one of the few randomized controlled trials of TIK conducted in a non-Western sample. Our results corroborated the findings of prior studies of TIK and provided preliminary support for its effectiveness across different cultural contexts.

Children's Perceptual Sensitivity to Optic Flow-Like Visual Motion Differs From Adults	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Observers experience complex patterns of visual motion in daily life due to their own movements through space, the movement of objects, and the geometry of surfaces in the visible world. Motion information shapes behavior and brain activity beginning in infancy. And yet most prior behavioral research has focused on how children process only one type, linear motion, leaving largely unexplored how children respond to radial or rotational motion patterns that co-occur with linear motion in everyday visual experience. This study examined how children and adults detect linear and radial motion patterns corrupted by a range of noise levels. Five to eight-year-old children (n = 25, 16 females; 76% White, 4% Asian, 16% more than one, 4% unknown) and young adults (n = 29, 15 females; 83.33% White, 16.67% Asian) viewed pairs of radial and linear motion displays mixed with random noise at one of two speeds (2 deg/s or 8 deg/s). Participants selected the display with coherent motion. Children and adults showed higher accuracy (percent correct) to radial versus linear motion patterns. Children had higher accuracy to the faster speed, while adults showed the opposite pattern. Adults showed better performance than children in all conditions. Exploratory analyses showed that male children had higher accuracy than their female peers. We conclude that motion processing develops in childhood with separable developmental trajectories for the processing of slow and fast visual motion, and that while further investigation is warranted, sex differences in motion processing found in young and older adults may begin in middle childhood.

Evidence for a Kernel of Truth in Children's Facial Impressions of Children's Niceness, but Not Shyness	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Adults teach children not to "judge a book by its cover." However, adults make rapid judgments of character from a glance at a child's face. These impressions can be modestly accurate, suggesting that adults may be sensitive to valid signals of character in children's faces. However, it is not clear whether such sensitivity requires decades of social experience, in line with the development of other face-processing abilities (e.g., facial emotion recognition), or whether this sensitivity emerges relatively early, in childhood. An important theoretical question therefore, is whether or not children's impressions are at all accurate. Here, we examined the accuracy in children's impressions of niceness and shyness from children's faces. Children (aged 7-12 years, similar to 90% Caucasian) and adults rated 84 unfamiliar children's faces (aged 4-11 years, 48 female, similar to 80% Caucasian) for niceness (Study 1) or shyness (Study 2). To measure accuracy, we correlated facial impressions with parental responses to well-established questionnaires about the actual niceness/shyness of those children in the images. Overall, children and adults formed highly similar niceness (r = .94) and shyness (r = .84) impressions. Children also showed mature impression accuracy: Children and adults formed modestly accurate niceness impressions, across different images of the same child's face. Neither children nor adults showed evidence for accurate shyness impressions. Together, these results suggest that children's impressions are relatively mature by middle childhood. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that any mechanisms driving accurate niceness impressions are in place by 7 years, and potentially before.

In addition, early predictors of the profiles were analyzed with respect to kindergarten cognitive skills (phonological awareness, letter knowledge, rapid automized naming [RAN], number counting, word reading, vocabulary, and listening comprehension), parental factors (level of education, reading difficulties), and gender. Four different profiles of reading fluency and reading comprehension development were identified using latent profile analysis. These comprised one profile with persistent reading difficulties across the grades, one with early poor reading skills but with a resolving tendency, one with average reading skills, and one with good readers who started with very high reading fluency but scored average over time. Of the kindergarten measures, parental reading difficulties, being male, low paternal level of education, slow RAN, difficulty in reading easy words, and low scores in phonological skills, letter knowledge, number counting, and vocabulary predicted reading difficulties. The children belonging to the profile with the resolving tendency showed an increased rate of family risk and multiple cognitive deficits but managed to resolve their reading difficulties. Being female, and good number counting and vocabulary skills predicted a tendency to resolve early reading difficulties. The results confirm the previous findings on the early predictors of reading difficulties and add to the literature by identifying skills that predict resolving patterns.

Children participating in a Canadian longitudinal survey with available information on childcare attendance between ages 3 and 5 years (N = 6,852) were measured on multiple social behaviors (hyperactivity/inattention, depression/anxiety, disruptive behaviors) and academic outcomes (mathematic skills, academic achievement) across both childhood and adolescence. We conducted a propensity score matching analysis to control the selection bias for childcare attendance and performed generalized estimating equation models for panel data among matched groups. Our results showed no clear social or academic long-term advantage for Canadian children of attending any childcare arrangement in comparison to children being exclusively cared for by their parents. In contrast, children attending daycare centers had higher levels of hyperactivity/inattention until the age of 15 years. Children also had lower mathematic skills if attending daycare centers or informal childcare at preschool age, but this effect dissipated from childhood to adolescence. Interestingly, children from low-income families had higher levels of depression/anxiety if being cared for at home by someone other than their parents or relatives. This finding supports the dual-risk hypothesis suggesting that children from already impoverished families and attending informal childcare in their own home are at greater risk for internalizing difficulties.

Although previous research has found that the language children hear during those interactions predicts vocabulary outcomes, few studies have investigated how qualitative features of social interactions work together to affect children's vocabulary development, particularly for underresourced, language minoritized children. This study examined patterns of maternal interactive behaviors during toddlerhood in relation to children's later Spanish and English vocabulary development among 318 low-income, Mexican American families. Five maternal behaviors (acknowledging, elaborating, gaze, vocal appropriateness, and overriding) were coded from video recordings at age 24 months. At 36 and 54 months, child expressive vocabulary was assessed in both English and Spanish. Latent class analysis identified five distinct patterns of maternal interactive behaviors, which differentially supported or compromised child expressive language in English and Spanish.

The Integrative Model of Family Stress Underlying Spanish and English Vocabulary Development in Mexican American Children: Unique Effects of Financial and Sociocultural Hardships	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Early oral language development lays an essential foundation for academic and socioemotional competencies but is vulnerable to the impact of family stress. Despite robust evidence that family stress affects early oral language development in monolingual samples, little is known about whether the family stress processes affecting language acquisition are similar among dual language learners. Furthermore, although Mexican American families often face stressors related to their ethnic minority and immigrant status, no studies to date have tested whether exposure to sociocultural stressors may likewise have negative consequences for early language acquisition. The present study examined whether financial and sociocultural stressors were associated with maternal stress perception, parenting sensitivity, and child Spanish and English receptive vocabulary at child age 3 and 4.5 years. Participants included 322 low-income Mexican American mothers and their children followed from pregnancy through 4.5 years postnatal; most mothers preferred to speak Spanish (82%). Results of a path model indicated that links between family stress and child receptive vocabulary varied by language (Spanish or English) and stress type (financial or cultural). Specifically, Spanish acquisition was more closely related to the quality of mother-child interactions, whereas English acquisition was more susceptible to the direct impact of family stress. The consequences of family stress on children's vocabulary acquisition were evident earlier in development for Spanish than English, and appeared more pronounced for financial versus sociocultural stressors. Findings underscore a need to attend to the impact of poverty on children's Spanish and English language development in low-income, Mexican American children.

This study examined differences in the development of STEM identity and efficacy during high school among Mexican-origin youth-a large and fast-growing demographic group that shows developmental assets and risks. Contextualizing development within larger community structures, this examination focused on the diverse array of destinations throughout the United States where Mexican-origin youth are living as contexts for their STEM identity and efficacy development. Drawing on a dataset integrating the High School Longitudinal study of 2009; Civil Rights Data Collection, decennial U.S. censuses, and the American Community Survey, multilevel models revealed variability in Mexican-origin math/science identity and efficacy development across destinations. Mexican-origin youth in established destinations had higher net growth in math identity but lower net growth in science efficacy than Whites in established destinations. Mexican-origin youth in new destinations followed similar trajectories as their Mexican-origin peers in established destinations but had lower net growth in science identity. Additionally, these patterns varied by immigrant generation. Mexican-origin youth who were the U.S.-born children of immigrants in established destinations had higher net growth in math identity than Whites in established destinations, but this generational group in new destinations had lower net growth in math identity, science identity, and science efficacy than these peers. These findings highlight the importance of communities and their embedded ecological contexts in shaping STEM identity and efficacy among Mexican-origin youth.

H.; Winsler, Adam			Early Bilingualism Predicts Enhanced Later Foreign Language Learning in Secondary School	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Foreign language learning is generally not required in the United States, despite its link to various cognitive and social benefits later in life. Students who speak a home language different from the instructional language of school may experience unique benefits when learning additional languages in school. The present study examined whether students' early language status (monolingual, dual language learner [DLL], or bilingual) in Kindergarten predicts later foreign language course enrollment and performance in middle and high school. A total of 33,247 students (48% female, 59% Latino, 34% Black, 7% White/Asian/other, 82% receiving free/reduced-price lunch) were assessed for school readiness at age 4 and prospectively followed through high school. Regression analyses predicted foreign language course enrollment and performance in middle or high school, with students' demographic, school readiness, and prior academic performance as covariates. Results show early language status significantly predicts later enrollment and performance in foreign language courses, even after controlling for student demographics, school readiness skills, and early academic achievement. Early bilinguals were more likely to take foreign language courses than DLLs, who enrolled in such courses more than monolingual students. The same pattern favoring bilinguals, then DLLs, then monolinguals was found for performance in foreign language courses. Early bilingualism is an important resource for young children that continues to offer benefits throughout schooling. Implications for heritage language maintenance, language learning, and bilingual education are discussed.

Moreover, the biological etiology underlying the relationship between musicality and childhood language development is poorly understood. Here we explored genetic and environmental associations between music engagement and verbal ability in the Colorado Adoption/Twin Study of Lifespan behavioral development & cognitive aging (CATSLife). Adolescents (N = 1,684) completed measures of music engagement and intelligence at approximately age 12 and/or multiple tests of verbal ability at age 16. Structural equation models revealed that instrument engagement was highly heritable (a(2) = .78), with moderate heritability of singing (a(2) = .43) and dance engagement (a(2) = .66). Adolescent self-reported instrument engagement (but not singing or dance engagement) was genetically correlated with age 12 verbal intelligence and still was associated with age 16 verbal ability, even when controlling for age 12 full-scale intelligence, providing evidence for a longitudinal relationship between music engagement and language beyond shared general cognitive processes. Together, these novel findings suggest that shared genetic influences in part accounts for phenotypic associations between music engagement and language, but there may also be some (weak) direct benefits of music engagement on later language abilities.

J	Andersen, SH; Steinberg, L; Belsky, J				Andersen, Signe H.; Steinberg, Laurence; Belsky, Jay			Beyond Early Years Versus Adolescence: The Interactive Effect of Adversity in Both Periods on Life-Course Development	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Developmental scholars, parents, and policymakers alike have long heralded the opening years of life as disproportionately influential. Recent work on adolescence has revealed, however, greater influence of these later years-but without considering how experience during these two periods interact. We address this issue by studying adverse experiences (e.g., parental divorce, incarceration) measured at ages 0-5 years and 13-18 years on problematic development at 18-19 years (e.g., criminal behavior, disconnection from school and work) on 363,444 Danish siblings. Given multiple possible interaction patterns, no predictions were advanced. The extent to which adverse experiences in early childhood impact future problematic development depends on level of adversity experienced in adolescence: Only when exposure to adversity in adolescence was limited did greater early life adversity predict poorer future outcomes. Otherwise, adolescent adversity swamped effects of early life adversity. Results are discussed in terms of the design and context of the research.

Family Context, Life Transitions, and Subjective Well-Being From Age 18 to 50 Years	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examined how family context at age 18 (parent-adolescent conflict, parental support, parent education) predicted between-person variation in subjective well-being (SWB; depressive symptoms and self-esteem) trajectories from age 18 to 50 years. Timing of leaving home, getting married, and becoming a parent were explored as life transitions linking family context to within-person variation in SWB. The sample consisted of 604 participants residing in a western Canadian city at age 18 (50% female; 15% with non-White ethnic origin; 29% had at least one university-educated parent) and tracked for up to 32 years. Results of conditional latent curve models with structured residuals revealed that, amid a general increase in SWB from adolescence into midlife, those with lower parent-adolescent conflict and higher parent support had higher SWB at age 18, a between-person difference largely maintained to age 50. Parents' higher education also predicted higher self-esteem, sustained into midlife. Across analyses, transition timing inconsistently predicted within-person fluctuations in SWB, with on-time transitions associated with better than typical SWB. The most robust predictors of SWB at the within-person level were marital and parental status; getting married and becoming a parent were associated with better than typical SWB at ages 25, 43, and 50 years. Family context variables were generally not associated with transition timing, and there were no indirect associations from family context to within-person variation in SWB. Results suggest that family context influences one's well-being trajectory, but forming one's own family results in positive deviations from that path.

J	Mitchell, LL; Adler, JM; Carlsson, J; Eriksson, PL; Syed, M				Mitchell, Lauren L.; Adler, Jonathan M.; Carlsson, Johanna; Eriksson, Py Liv; Syed, Moin			A Conceptual Review of Identity Integration Across Adulthood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Though Erikson recognized identity development as a lifelong project, most research on identity has focused on adolescents and emerging adults. Less is known about how the identity formed in adolescence is maintained and adapted across the adult life span. The purpose of the present paper is to provide a conceptual review and elaboration of Erikson's (1968) theory focused on identity integration, a construct that is particularly relevant to adult identity development. Identity integration describes the process of bringing together various aspects of one's self into a coherent whole, and the sense of self-continuity and wholeness that emerges as a result of these processes. Informed by the identity and life span development literatures, we present a conceptual framework that describes how identity integration is maintained across the adult life span, and how it is reestablished when changing life circumstances present threats to an individual's identity. These maintenance and reestablishment processes help to support adults' well-being and adaptation to major life transitions and stressful events. This conceptual framework is intended to facilitate research on identity integration in adulthood, a time of life that has been less often studied in the identity literature but that can involve identity dynamics that are just as critical as those in adolescence.

The Longitudinal Influence of Parenting and Parents' Traces on Narrative Identity in Young Adulthood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This longitudinal follow-up studied continued effects of parental influences on narrative identity in young adulthood. Decades of research have shown the importance of parental shared reminiscing and positive parenting for the development of children's and youths' autobiographical memory and narrative identity. Yet, research on long-term influences of parenting on narrative indices in adulthood is scarce, even though parents' traces remain a part of narrative identity throughout the life span (Kober & Habermas, 2018). Therefore, in this study, 118 individuals (at time 1: M-age = 17.3 years, SD = .77, 73% female, 82% White) reported at age 17 on their perceived positive parenting. As emerging and young adults, as part of follow-ups at ages 26 and again at 32, participants provided life story interviews. First, it was tested whether earlier positive parenting longitudinally predicted parents' traces in later life stories. Second, we studied the joint long-term prediction of parenting and parents' traces to several narrative features of these young adults' life stories, including emotional tone, coherent positive resolution, and narrative complexity. Results replicated prior research on parents' traces and showed moreover that perceived parenting shape offspring's narrative identity well into young adulthood. These long-term findings are consistent with the notion that narrative identity in adulthood is rooted in the family, and continuously shaped by experiences with parents.

Motivational Profiles Across Domains and Academic Choices Within Eccles et al.'s Situated Expectancy-Value Theoretical Framework	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This longitudinal person-centered study aimed to identify profiles of subjective task values and ability self-concepts of adolescents in the domain of mathematics, English, biology, and physics in Grades 10 and 12. We were interested in gendered changes of profile membership, and in relations between profile membership and educational and occupational outcomes in adulthood. Data were drawn from the Michigan Study of Adolescent and Adult Life Transitions. We focused on students who participated in the data collection in Grades 10 and 12 (N = 911; 56.1% female; M-age = 16.49, SD = .63; 91.2% European American, 4.6% African American, and 2.1% other ethnic groups such as Hispanic, Asian, Native American). Data on subsequent college majors were assessed 2, 6, and 10 years after finishing high school and data on occupational outcomes was assessed up to 22 years after high school. Using Latent Profile Analyses, our findings revealed five profiles in grade 10 and four profiles in grade 12, which were meaningfully related to student gender. Latent Transition Analyses showed that motivational beliefs became more hierarchical over time. Gendered changes in profile membership occurred, with boys experiencing a process of specialization into mathematics domains. We were also able to show that gender-specific intraindividual hierarchies of motivational beliefs were related to gender-specific specialization processes in adolescence and to subsequent gendered choices throughout the life course.

Quarantined youths had limited in-person interactions with peers. The present study used an intensive longitudinal design to investigate changes in interpersonal dynamics and mental health during COVID-19. Specifically, we investigated whether the associations between different social contexts-that is, "spillover"-changed during COVID-19 and whether changes in social interactions during COVID-19 was associated with changes in depressive symptoms. Approximately 1 year prior to the onset of COVID-19, 139 youths reported depressive symptoms and daily interactions with parents, siblings, and friends, every day for 21 days via online questionnaires. Shortly after schools closed due to COVID-19, 115 of these youths completed a similar 28-day diary. Analyses included 112 youths (62 girls; 73% Caucasian; M-age = 11.77, range = 8 to 15 in Wave 1) who completed at least 13 diary days in each data wave. Our results show that younger adolescents experienced significant decreases in negative and positive interactions with friends, whereas older adolescents showed significant decreases in negative interactions with friends and significant increases in positive interactions with siblings. As predicted, within-day spillover of positive interactions and person-level association of negative interactions increased within the family during COVID-19, whereas within-day spillover of positive interactions between family and friends decreased. We also found a dramatic increase in depressive symptoms. More negative interactions and fewer positive interactions with family members were associated with changes in depressive symptoms. Our study sheds light on how youths' social development may be impacted by COVID-19.

J	Weeland, J; Keijsers, L; Branje, S				Weeland, Joyce; Keijsers, Loes; Branje, Susan			Introduction to the Special Issue: Parenting and Family Dynamics in Times of the COVID-19 Pandemic	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic brought about worldwide challenges and had a profound impact on family dynamics, relationships, and routines. At the same time, the impact may differ largely due to regional differences in the numbers of infections and severity of preventive measures, as well as individual and contextual risk and protective factors. The aims of this special issue were therefore to (a) provide insight into the impact of the pandemic on the family system and (b) increase our understanding of how this impact may differ between families. This special issue consists of 13 original empirical studies that show how the pandemic affected families across different levels of the family system. At first sight, it seems that many families were able to cope relatively well with the stressors. Yet, for others the demands of the pandemic and pandemic-related measures seemed to exceed their capabilities and available resources. Importantly, the studies in this special issue suggest that the pandemic disproportionally affected children, caregivers and families who were already at risk. Together, the contributions to the special issue offer knowledge on the consequences of both the pandemic and preventive measures on family functioning. At the same time, it also raises questions on the long-term impact of the pandemic and its impact on families who are currently underrepresented in empirical research.

Family Resilience and Psychological Distress in the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Mixed Methods Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Many changes were thrust upon families by the COVID-19 pandemic, including mandated quarantines, social distancing, transitions to distance learning for children, and remote work. The current study used mixed methods to examine the challenges and resilience of families in the United States during the pandemic (May-July 2020), as well as predictors and moderators of parent/child psychological distress. Our sample included 469 parents (459 mothers) of children aged similar to 2-13 years (239 girls, 228 boys, one nonbinary child, one "prefer not to answer" selection), who completed an online survey with closed-ended and open-ended portions. The sample had middle-to-high socioeconomic status and 86% of families were White/non-Hispanic. Qualitative (content and thematic analyses) and quantitative (descriptive statistics and regressions) findings revealed that, even in this relatively privileged sample, parents and families were experiencing struggles in many life domains (e.g., family, school) and shifts in family dynamics and routines, which were related to emotional and mental health. Families experienced many changes in their lives, some positive and some negative, and often exhibited resilience through managing these changes. Our moderation analyses indicated that COVID-19's daily impact was significantly associated with psychological distress for children and parents, and this association was stronger for older versus younger children. Less active/instructive parental media mediation was also related to less child psychological distress. Moving forward, practitioners can focus on preventive efforts including psychoeducation regarding healthy outlets for negative emotions during COVID-19, and practical help troubleshooting childcare and health care challenges impacting many families.

Parenting Adolescents in Times of a Pandemic: Changes in Relationship Quality, Autonomy Support, and Parental Control?	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This Dutch multi-informant study examined effects of the first COVID-19 lockdown (LD; e.g., school closure and social restrictions) on parent-adolescent relationships. Four biweekly measurements before and 4 biweekly measurements during the LD were collected among adolescents (N = 179, M-age = 14.26 years, 69% girls) and their parents (N = 144, M-age = 47.01 years, 81% female). Parents' educational level was relatively diverse: 12% low (high school or lower), 33% medium (vocational training), and 55% high (college or university). Adolescents and parents reported on parental support, parent-adolescent conflict, autonomy support, psychological control, behavioral control, and time spent on various activities. Adolescents spent more time with their parents during LD (before M = 8.6 hr, during M = 12.7 hr), but less time with friends (before M = 8.1 hr, during M = 2.1 hr), and reported on average 13 COVID-19-related rules. Preregistered piecewise growth models confirmed that autonomy support decreased immediately during the LD, but no mean level changes were observed in the other relationship dimensions. During the first 2 months of the LD, parents reported gradual increases in autonomy support and decreases in behavioral control. Moreover, significant differences between families were found in sudden and more gradual relationship changes, which correlated strongly with pre-LD characteristics of the relationship, and in some models with adolescent oppositional defiance and legitimacy beliefs. In sum, findings suggest resilience in most families, but also heterogeneity: Some families were negatively affected, and others were positively affected. A tailored approach is therefore needed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on family functioning.

Changes in Family Chaos and Family Relationships During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence From a Longitudinal Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The purpose of this article was to explore how family chaos, parenting processes, parent-child relationship qualities, and sibling relationship qualities changed before versus the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants included one parent and two adolescent-aged children from 682 families (2,046 participants). Parents and youth participating in an ongoing longitudinal study in five Midwestern states in the United States completed an additional web-based assessment of family processes and family relationship qualities during the May-June 2020 pandemic-related shutdowns. A series of two-wave latent change score models indicated that family chaos increased with the onset of pandemic-related shutdowns and that the level of chaos within a family during the shutdowns had implications for changes in several parenting processes and family relationship qualities. Specifically, higher levels of family chaos during the pandemic mitigated observed increases in parental knowledge and were associated with declines in parental autonomy granting. Family chaos during pandemic-related shutdowns also was associated with increases in maternal-child conflict, paternal-child conflict, and sibling conflict as well as decreases in paternal-child intimacy, sibling intimacy, and sibling disclosure. Overall, consistent with a family stress perspective, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased strain and commotion within many households, and these changes had implications for multiple family relationships.					, Jennifer/HPD-4891-2023; Mustillo, Sarah/LJL-2569-2024; Dotterer, Aryn/KEJ-1000-2024; Dotterer, Aryn/AEU-4375-2022	Whiteman, Shawn/0000-0001-9782-2120; Serang, Sarfaraz/0000-0002-7985-4951; Dotterer, Aryn/0000-0002-4199-0165; Maggs, Jennifer L/0000-0003-1601-6990; Dayley, Jenna/0000-0002-4740-3160													0012-1649	1939-0599				OCT	2021	57	10			SI		1597	1610		10.1037/dev0001217	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001217								34807683					WOS:000723689000004

Changes in family routines and experiences of COVID-19-related stress might negatively impact the quality of parenting and the parent-adolescent relationship. However, using active coping strategies might be associated with limited negative or even positive changes in the parent-adolescent relationship. This longitudinal, multi-informant, and pre-registered study used data of 240 mostly Dutch parents (85% mothers; M-age = 44.2 years old) and adolescents (50% girls; M-age = 11.4 years) from diverse SES backgrounds. Using Latent Change Score models, we examined how parent-reported parenting (i.e., positive parenting and discipline practices) and adolescent-reported relationship quality (i.e., support and negative interaction) changed from pre-COVID-19 (Fall 2019) to the COVID-19 period (Spring 2020). Moreover, we investigated whether parents' and adolescents' level of COVID-19-related stress was associated with the change in relationships, and whether active coping moderated the association between stress and changes in relationships. Results showed average decreases in support, positive parenting, and negative interactions between parents and adolescents. COVID-19-related stress was not a direct predictor of relationship changes and there was little evidence of moderating effects. Only adolescents' use of active coping strategies moderated the effect of stress on positive parenting. For high active coping adolescents, the link between stress and change in positive parenting was negative, whereas for low active coping adolescents this link was positive. The findings suggest that parent-adolescent relationships during a pandemic need attention, especially for adolescents with high stress levels and using active coping strategies.

Parents' Distress and Poor Parenting During a COVID-19 Lockdown: The Buffering Effects of Partner Support and Cooperative Coparenting	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The COVID-19 pandemic is placing demands on parents that may amplify the risk of parents' distress and poor parenting. Leveraging a prepandemic study in New Zealand, the current research tested whether parents' psychological distress during a mandated lockdown predicts relative residual changes in poorer parenting and whether partner support and cooperative coparenting buffer this potentially detrimental effect. Participants included 362 parents; 310 were from the same family (155 dyads). Parents had completed assessments of psychological distress and parenting prior to the pandemic and then reported on their distress, parenting, partner support, and cooperative coparenting during a nationwide COVID-19 lockdown. Parents' distress during the lockdown predicted relative residual increases in harsh parenting, but this effect was buffered by partner support. Parents' distress also predicted residual decreases in warm/responsive parenting and parent-child relationship quality, but these effects were buffered by cooperative coparenting. Partner support and cooperative coparenting are important targets for future research and interventions to help parents navigate challenging family contexts, including COVID-19 lockdowns.

The current study capitalizes on a longitudinal, cross-national study of parenting, adolescent development, and young adult competence to document the association between personal disruption during the pandemic and reported changes in internalizing and externalizing behavior in young adults and their mothers since the pandemic began. It further investigates whether family functioning during adolescence 3 years earlier moderates this association. Data from 484 families in five countries (Italy, the Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and the United States) reveal that higher levels of reported disruption during the pandemic are related to reported increases in internalizing and externalizing behaviors after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic for young adults (M-age = 20) and their mothers in all five countries, with the exception of one association in Thailand. Associations between disruption during the pandemic and young adults' and their mothers' reported increases in internalizing and externalizing behaviors were attenuated by higher levels of youth disclosure, more supportive parenting, and lower levels of destructive adolescent-parent conflict prior to the pandemic. This work has implications for fostering parent-child relationships characterized by warmth, acceptance, trust, open communication, and constructive conflict resolution at all times given their protective effects for family resilience during times of crisis.

J	Ren, HG; Cheah, CSL; Liu, JS				Ren, Huiguang; Cheah, Charissa S. L.; Liu, Junsheng			The Cost and Benefit of Fear Induction Parenting on Children's Health During the COVID-19 Outbreak	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was an unprecedented global public health emergency with a significant psychological toll. This study aimed to understand how specific COVID-19 related stressors contributed to Chinese parents' fear induction practices, and how these practices, in turn, contributed to their children's disease prevention practices during the outbreak and depressive symptoms after the outbreak. Parents (N = 240, M-age = 38.50 years, 75% mothers) with elementary-school-age children (M-age = 9.48 years, 46% girls) in Wenzhou, 1 of the most impacted cities in China, reported on the presence of confirmed or suspected cases in their communities, their frequencies of consuming COVID-19-related information, fear induction practices, and their children's trait anxiety and disease prevention practices during the outbreak (January 28-30, 2020). Child-reported depressive symptoms were collected between March 7-11, 2020; during which there were very few remaining cases and no new confirmed cases or deaths. Parents' higher frequency of virus-related information consumption but not the presence of community infection was associated with their engagement in more fear induction practices, which was in turn associated with children's greater engagement in prevention practices during the outbreak, but more postquarantine depressive symptoms. Child trait anxiety exacerbated the association between parent fear induction and child depressive symptoms. Using fear induction parenting may promote children's willingness to cooperate and participate in disease prevention practices during the crisis but at the cost of children's long-term mental health.

Shocks to the System: The Influence of COVID-19-Related Stressors on Coparental and Family Functioning	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												In addition to the fears associated with contracting COVID-19, the pandemic has forced families across the United States to quickly transition to new patterns of living. These transitions present new stressors, including health-related concerns, new demands placed on families by lockdowns and stay-at-home orders, and the possibility of losing a job or inability to pay bills. Such stressors have the potential to disrupt collaboration between coparents in addition to basic family functioning. Drawing upon a family systems perspective, the current study thus sought to examine links between COVID-19-related stressors and family cohesion through coparental functioning. A total of 1,003 parent/caregivers (97% from the United States; 82% Caucasian, 74% female; M = 40.9 years old, SD = 8.5; M-income = $83,631, SDincome = $36,320) of school-age children completed an initial online survey from the end of March to the end of April of 2020. Of the initial sample, a total of 685 parents/caregivers completed weekly diaries for a month. Based on multilevel modeling, results suggested that, at the between-family level, coparental conflict mediated the impact of the stress of parenting/work demands and financial stress on family cohesion. At the within-family level, weekly spikes in health-related stress were associated with corresponding spikes in coparental conflict, which, in turn, were associated with drops in family cohesion. Results from the current study suggest that beyond the fears associated with contracting the COVID-19 virus, other key stressors associated with the emerging pandemic played a role in increasing coparental conflict, ultimately exacerbating family functioning.

Implications of COVID-19 School Closures for Sibling Dynamics Among US Latinx Children: A Prospective, Daily Diary Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study aimed to illuminate the implications of COVID-19 school closures for sibling dynamics among Latinx school-age children in the U.S. and to examine family and cultural factors that may have conditioned school closure effects. Data came from an ongoing study of Latinx families in Arizona that collected home visit and survey data prepandemic (fall 2019; T1) and daily diary data during the outbreak (February to May 2020; T2). The analyses focused on 215 Latinx children (47% female; M-age = 9.72, SD = 1.22; 88% Mexican-origin) from 116 families (T1 family income median = $27,600, SD = $24,421). Multilevel tobit regression models were estimated to examine associations linking both T2 school closure and number of days since school closure with daily sibling positivity and negativity. The models also tested moderation effects of T1 family socioeconomic status, sibship size, child enculturation, and prior sibling positivity and negativity on these associations. Results showed that, although main effects of school closure on sibling dynamics were nonsignificant, school closure was linked to more sibling positivity in families with more children and among more enculturated children, and days since school closure was linked to more sibling positivity in families with more children and to lower sibling negativity among those with less prepandemic sibling negativity. Findings highlight differentiated effects of COVID-19 school closures on sibling dynamics among Latinx children whose families have been disproportionally affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, illuminate the role of Latinx family cultural strengths, and have implications for intervention programs and public policies.

Distance Learning, Parent-Child Interactions, and Affective Well-Being of Parents and Children During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Daily Diary Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												To slow down the spread of the COVID-19 virus, schools around the world were closed in early 2020, transferring children's scholastic activities to the homes and imposing a massive burden on parents and school-age children. Using data of a 21-day diary study conducted between March and April 2020 in Germany, this work examined whether (a) distance learning and (b) parents' involvement therein were associated with negative parent-child interactions and affective well-being of parents and children, over and above the effect of daily stressors. Participants were 562 parents (489 mothers, M-age = 42.79, SDage = 6.12, range = 25-63) most of whom were married (n = 382, 68.0%). They responded to the daily items with respect to the youngest child living in their household (M-age = 9.74, SDage = 2.81, range = 6-19). On days when children were working on school tasks, parents reported more negative parent-child interactions as well as lower parental and child positive affect and higher child negative affect, but not higher parental negative affect. Moreover, days when parents were more heavily involved in learning (i.e., when children worked less independently) were days with more negative parent-child interactions, lower parental and child positive affect, and higher parental and child negative affect. Negative parent-child interactions were linked to lower affective well-being of parents and children, and partially accounted for the relation among daily stressors and affective well-being. The present work highlights the need for measures to better support school-age children and their parents during distance learning.

However, little is known about the impact of parent-child relationships on adolescents' mental health during this transition. Using a 2-wave longitudinal design, this research examined the role of parent-child conflict and intimacy in adolescents' psychological distress after school reopening. Immediately before school reopening, 879 Chinese adolescents (mean age = 13.14 years, 51% girls) reported on their parent-child conflict and intimacy. They also reported on their depressive symptoms and anger problems before and 3 months after school reopening. Youth who reported higher levels of parent-child conflict and lower levels of parent-child intimacy before school reopening were more likely to show increased depressive symptoms and anger problems over time. Moreover, the moderating role of parent-child conflict and intimacy in the link between youth's perceived stress toward school reopening and psychological distress was investigated. Specifically, parent-child conflict moderated the impact of youth's perceived stress on their psychological distress, such that greater perceived stress was only linked with more psychological distress over time in families with higher levels of parent-child conflict, but not in families with lower levels of parent-child conflict. Taken together, the findings highlight the important role of parent-child relationships in shaping adolescent's mental health as they return to school, which provides key insights into reducing adolescents' psychological distress during the transition of school reopening in COVID-19 pandemic.					李, 晓茹/ISU-2196-2023; Zhang, Keqin/JHT-9115-2023	He, Xiaohuang/0000-0002-8679-2728; Qu, Yang/0000-0002-6173-8100													0012-1649	1939-0599				OCT	2021	57	10			SI		1735	1747		10.1037/dev0001218	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001218								34807693					WOS:000723689000014
J	Masten, AS				Masten, Ann S.			Family Risk and Resilience in the Context of Cascading COVID-19 Challenges: Commentary on the Special Issue COMMENT	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Articles comprising this special issue on parenting and family dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic document the profound disruptions to family life posed by a cascading multisystem catastrophe as well as the capacity of families for resilience. Results of these studies during the first year of the pandemic align well with theory and past evidence on developmental risk, vulnerability, and resilience in families contending with large-scale complex disasters, while also illustrating methodological advances, such as technologies for remote data collection. The scope and duration of the global pandemic pose extraordinary, cumulative, and variable challenges to family life, highlighting the importance of preexisting as well as unfolding adaptive capabilities embedded in multiple interacting systems. Findings illustrate the importance of relationships, the vulnerability of families already at risk, and the protective role of social support for parenting. This issue represents an exciting harbinger of knowledge to come on risk and resilience processes from multisystem, multidisciplinary, and multicultural studies of the pandemic and its effects. There are critical gaps to fill and many questions yet to answer when so many systems critical to human well-being and development are disrupted, and knowledge is needed to prepare and respond more effectively to inevitable disasters of the future. It will be essential to include more diverse and representative samples, methods amenable to dynamic modeling of change and systematic aggregation of findings across studies, and long-term assessments. This special issue reflects the progress, complexities, and promise of family-focused research on risk and resilience in the time of COVID-19.

Most of this research has focused on 1 child per family, thereby obfuscating patterns that are differentially operative at the family-wide (i.e., between-family) versus child-specific (i.e., within-family) levels of analysis. Thus, the current study evaluates multilevel, longitudinal associations between COVID-19 disruption, family relationships, and caregiver/child mental health using a sibling comparison methodology. Caregivers (N = 549 families with 1098 children between 5 and 18 years old) were recruited from the Prolific research panel (73% White-European; 68% female; 76% United Kingdom, 19% U.S.A.; median 2019 income $50,000-$74,999). Caregiver reports of COVID-19 disruption, psychological distress, family functioning, parenting, and child mental health (for 2 children per family) were provided during May (time 1) and July (time 2) 2020. A Bayesian multilevel path analysis with random effects revealed: (a) families were experiencing difficulties across domains when COVID-19 disruption was high; (b) COVID-19 disruption corresponded to greater sibling differences in mental health; and (c) the sibling with poorer mental health received lower quality parenting over time, especially in families who reported higher levels of differential parenting. Findings suggest that understanding children's mental health difficulties during COVID-19 requires a family system lens due to the multiple ways these consequences permeate across the family unit. Comprehensive interventions for children's mental health during this time will likely require an examination of caregiver, sibling, and whole-family dynamics in the context of evidence-based telehealth practice.

Vanden Bosch der; Vouloumanos, Athena			Infant Biases for Detecting Speech in Complex Scenes	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												How do infants learn the sounds of their native language when there are many simultaneous sounds competing for their attention? Adults and children detect when speech sounds change in complex scenes better than when other sounds change. We examined whether infants have similar biases to detect when human speech changes better than nonspeech sounds including musical instruments, water, and animal calls in complex auditory scenes. We used a change deafness paradigm to examine whether 5-month-olds' change detection is biased toward certain sounds within high-level categories (e.g., biological or generated by humans) or whether change detection depends on low-level salient physical features such that detection is better for sounds with more distinct acoustic properties, such as water. In Experiment 1, 5-month-olds showed some evidence for detecting speech and music changes better than no change trials. In Experiment 2, when speech and music were compared separately with animal and water sounds, infants detected when speech and water changed, but not when music changed across scenes. Infants' change detection is both biased for certain sound categories, as they detected small speech changes better than other sounds, and affected by the size of the acoustic change, similar to young infants' attentional priorities in complex visual scenes. By 5 months, infants show some preferential processing of speech changes in complex auditory environments, which could help bootstrap the language learning process.

DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The relation between nonword repetition and vocabulary has been the focus of a theoretical controversy for several decades. The point of contention is whether the ability underlying nonword repetition drives vocabulary growth or vice versa. The present study examines longitudinal interrelations between nonword repetition and vocabulary from age 3 to 5 with random intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs). RI-CLPMs have the advantage of separating within-child dynamic processes from more stable differences between children, including time-stable unmeasured confounders. For n = 260 monolingual German-speaking children assessed at three time points with a lag of eleven months, RI-CLPM and, for comparison purposes, "classical" cross-lagged panel models (CLPMs) were estimated. The ill-fitting CLPMs in which cross-lagged effects combine within-child processes and stable differences between children yielded evidence consistent with reciprocal effects between nonword repetition and vocabulary (without covariates) or from nonword repetition to vocabulary (with covariates). Adding a random intercept markedly improved model fit. All within-child cross-lagged effects in the RI-CLPM were nonsignificant. Thus, the results provided no evidence consistent with within-child processes such as nonword repetition affecting vocabulary or vice versa for preschool-age children. Instead, results are more consistent with, for example, third variable explanations, within-child processes fading out by age 3 or occurring on a time frame that is not captured with a lag of approximately 1 year.

The development of these skills is related to and interdependent on other cognitive processes, particularly inhibitory control. Brain regions associated with inhibitory control and social cognition overlap functionally and structurally, especially with respect to frontal brain areas. We proposed that the neural foundations of inhibitory control and social cognition are measurable in infancy. We used structural equation modeling and showed that 10-month frontotemporal neuroconnectivity measured using electroencephalogram coherence predicts social cognition at 9 years of age through age-4 inhibitory control. These findings provide insight into the neurodevelopmental trajectory of cognition and suggest that connectivity from frontal regions to other parts of the brain is a foundation for the development of these skills.

DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Some work demonstrates toddlers show preferences in targets of their prosocial behavior, and a number of theorists have argued that young children become increasingly likely to direct their prosocial behavior to ingroup over outgroup targets with development. The goal of this study was to examine whether toddlers' early helping, sharing, and empathic distress were influenced by the race of the target person. Ninety-four White European American 18-month-old (17-19 months, M = 18.25, SD = .43; 55.1% male) and 24-month-old (23-25 months; M = 23.67, SD = .57; 53.1% male) toddlers took part in a series of tasks designed to assess children's instrumental helping, sharing, and empathic distress. These toddlers came from well-educated families (86.4% of mothers had a college degree and 73.8% of their partners had a college degree or more). In the study, the race of the needy target was manipulated, so that half of the children had the opportunity to respond prosocially to a White target and half had the opportunity to be prosocial to a Black target. The race of the needy experimenter influenced children's instrumental helping and emotional arousal in a feigned injury task, but did not influence their sharing behavior. Contrary to our hypothesis, though, the older toddlers expressed more empathic distress and arousal to the Black experimenter's feigned injury than to a White experimenter's feigned injury. Implications for theory and research aimed at understanding discriminatory prosocial behaviors between young children are discussed.

J	Willoughby, M; Hudson, K; Hong, YH; Wylie, A				Willoughby, Michael; Hudson, Kesha; Hong, Yihua; Wylie, Amanda			Improvements in Motor Competence Skills Are Associated With Improvements in Executive Function and Math Problem-Solving Skills in Early Childhood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Efforts to increase moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in school-age children are associated with improved health, cognitive, and academic outcomes. However, questions remain about whether similar benefits are observed in early childhood. We hypothesized that motor competence, not MVPA, would be related to improved cognitive and academic skill development in early childhood. For this study, 283 children were recruited from 13 community-based preschools (55% female; M = 4.2 years old, SD = .6; 41% non-Hispanic White, 37% non-Hispanic Black; 10% Hispanic, 10% mixed race, 2% Asian, 1% American Indian). Children's physical activity, motor competence, executive function (EF), and math problem-solving skills were measured using the same protocol in three assessments in a single academic year (i.e., fall, winter, spring). Although motor competence was strongly correlated with contemporaneous measures of EF and math problem-solving skills (rs = .51-.63), MVPA was weakly correlated with EF and math problem-solving skills (rs = .03-.18). Mixed linear models demonstrated that improvements in children's motor competence were related to improvements in their EF and math problem-solving skills (ps < .001), their improvements in MVPA were not statistically significant related to any of the outcomes. These within-child associations provide a stronger basis of inference by controlling for all time-invariant confounders. The results of this study suggest that efforts to improve motor competence skills in young children may improve EF and math problem-solving skills, though experimental studies are required to rigorously test this idea.

Longitudinal Changes in Young Children's Strategy Use for Emotion Regulation	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The development of strategies that support autonomous self-regulation of emotion is key for early childhood emotion regulation. Children are thought to transition from predominant reliance on more automatic or interpersonal strategies to reliance on more effortful, autonomous strategies as they develop cognitive skills that can be recruited for self-regulation. However, there are few longitudinal studies documenting age-related changes in different forms and dimensions of strategies. The current study tested predicted age-related changes in strategy use in a task requiring children to wait for something they want. Specifically, we examined the longitudinal trajectories of 3 strategies commonly observed in delayed reward tasks: self-soothing, seeking attention about the demands of waiting (bids), and distracting oneself. We followed a sample of 120 children (54% male, 93.3% white, from semirural and rural economically strained house-holds) from ages 24 months to 5 years who participated in a waiting task each year. Using growth curve modeling, we found declines in self-soothing, rises and then declines in bidding, and increases in distraction from 24 months to 5 years. Next, we investigated whether strategy use trajectories predicted adult ratings of children's emotion regulation during the task, that is, whether children appeared calm and acted appropriately while waiting. Growth in duration and dominance of distraction use predicted judgments that children were well-regulated by age 5 years, whereas growth in dominance of bidding use negatively predicted being rated as well-regulated. We discuss implications for the understanding of strategy development and future directions, including understanding strategy effectiveness.

Whereas evidence of this abounds in adults, little is known about its emergence and development in childhood. The few existing studies in children use different experimental paradigms and report contradictory developmental patterns. We examined effort-related decision-making in a sample of 79 five- to 11-year-olds using a parametric induction of cognitive effort and three paradigms that each involved decision-making between low- and high-effort options but varied in how explicit effort was made. This included a demand avoidance and an effort discounting paradigm. We also probed cognitive processes linked to effort-related decisions, including task performance, metacognitive accuracy, effort perception, and mental demand. We found that children of all ages were sensitive to parametric modulations of cognitive effort as indicated by self-report. In terms of effort-related decision-making we found that overall children demonstrated no implicit behavioral preference for low effort tasks, that older children stated a preference for low effort tasks, and that all children discounted effort. Further, implicit preference in the demand avoidance paradigm was linked to children's metacognitive insight into how well they could perform effortful tasks. These findings strongly suggest that although children are clearly sensitive to manipulations of cognitive effort, whether and when they use this information to guide their decisions to engage in effortful tasks depends strongly on the extent to which effortful features are made salient to them.

Conformity Decreases Throughout Middle Childhood Among Ni-Vanuatu Children: An Intracultural Comparison	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Multiple studies have shown that children conform to majorities in perceptual judgment tasks against their better knowledge. However, these studies report contradictory results about how conformity develops over age. Here, we study variation in conformity over the course of middle childhood: we examined potential informational and normative motivations underlying conformity, as well as intracultural variability in their age patterns. We measured conformity in both a public and a private setting among 5- to 11-year-olds from eight different communities in Vanuatu (n = 125, 59 boys), a highly diverse society in the South Pacific. We also explored whether selected sociodemographic variables help to explain individual variation in children's conformity. Conformity is lower in both public and private settings the older ni-Vanuatu children are, with conformity in public settings being subject to more developmental and intracultural variation. We infer that normative conformity is more variable than informational conformity. Moreover, we find that children in higher school classes conform less. Our study combines a developmental perspective with an intracultural comparison, and demonstrates that both the publicness of the experimental situation and intracultural variability are important for the understanding of the age patterns of conformity.

A Double-Edged Sword: Children's Intergroup Gender Attitudes Have Social Consequences for the Beholder	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We examined the development of children's positive and negative attitudes toward other-gender peers over 1 year, and explored the longitudinal social consequences of holding positive or negative attitudes on the beholder of these attitudes. Participants were 206 second graders (M-age = 7.18 yrs, SD = .56, 50% girls) and 206 fourth graders (M-age = 9.10 yrs, SD = .66, 44.2% girls) from diverse ethnic racial backgrounds (54.6% White; 17.2% Latinx, 4.4% Black, 5.3% Asian, 2.9% Native American,.7% Pacific Islander, 13.1% other) with average household income ranged from $51,000 to $75,000, and they were assessed in 2 consecutive years. Developmental change was assessed using latent change score analysis, which showed that positive other-gender attitudes increased over time (for boys) whereas negative other-gender attitudes decreased for everyone. Path analyses showed that both positive and negative other-gender attitudes predicted children's perceptions of stressful other-gender interactions and their inclusion expectancies by other-gender peers longitudinally, controlling for same-gender attitudes. We also examined the extent to which the predicted relation between attitudes and inclusion expectancies was mediated by children's perceptions of stressful experiences with other-gender peers. We found that the extent of mediation varied by the type of attitudes and by children's age. Overall, findings contributed to the understanding of the development of children's other-gender attitudes, and underscored the consequences of these attitudes for the beholder of attitudes. This work also sheds light on the discussion of intervention strategies aimed at improving children's gender-based intergroup relations.

Parasympathetic Activity, Emotion Socialization, and Internalizing and Externalizing Problems in Children: Longitudinal Associations Between and Within Families	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Biopsychosocial models of children's socioemotional development highlight the joint influences of physiological regulation and parenting practices. Both high and low levels of children's baseline respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) have been associated with children's maladjustment, indicative of nonlinear associations. Negative or unsupportive parental responses to children's emotions are consistently linked with internalizing (IP) and externalizing problems (EP), although few studies have examined how associations vary within families. This study examined within- and between-person associations of children's quadratic baseline RSA, negative maternal emotion socialization, and children's problems over 7 years. RSA was measured in 133 3.5-year-old children (72 female) in predominantly middle- to upper-middle socioeconomic status, Caucasian families. Mothers reported on their emotion socialization practices and their children's adjustment concurrently and 1, 5, and 7 years later. Multilevel structural equation models revealed quadratic associations between baseline RSA and both IP and EP at the between-person level, suggesting that children with moderate RSA had fewer adjustment problems, on average, than children with lower or higher RSA. Across time and between families, children displayed more problems if their mothers reported more negative responses to their children's emotions. Within families, IP were elevated on years when mothers reported higher than usual negative responses, and children with either high or low baseline RSA had more problems on years when mothers reported greater than usual negative responses to their children's emotions. Altogether, these findings suggest that high and low baseline RSA may increase the risk for maladjustment, particularly in the time-varying context of aversive emotion socialization practices.

Socioeconomic Origin, Future Expectations, and Educational Achievement: A Longitudinal Three-Generation Study of the Persistence of Family Advantage	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Expectations about the future direct effort in goal-oriented action and may influence a range of life course outcomes, including educational attainment. Here we investigate whether such expectations are implicated in the dynamics underlying the persistence of educational advantage across family generations, and whether such dynamics have changed in recent decades in view of historical change. Focusing on the role of domain-specific (educational) and general (optimism and control) expectations, we examine parallels across parent-child cohorts in (a) the relationships between parental socioeconomic status (SES) and children's future expectations and (b) the associations between children's future expectations and their academic achievement. We estimate structural equation models using data from the prospective multigenerational Youth Development Study (N = 422 three-generation triads [G1-G2-G3]; G1 M-age in 1988 = 41.0 years, G2 M-age in 1989 = 14.7 years, G3 M-age in 2011 = 15.8 years; G2 White in 1989 = 66.4%, G3 White in 2011 = 64.4%; G1 mean annual household income, converted to 2008 equivalents = $41,687, G2 mean annual household income in 2008 dollars = $42,962; G1 mode of educational attainment = high school, G2 mode of educational attainment = some college). We find intergenerational similarity in the relationships between parental educational attainment and children's future expectations. Children's educational expectations strongly predicted their academic achievement in the second generation, but not in the third generation. With educational expansion, the more recent cohort had higher educational expectations that were less strongly related to achievement. Overall, the findings reveal dynamics underlying the persistence of educational success across generations. The role of future expectations in this intergenerational process varies across historical time, confirming a central conclusion of life span developmental psychology and life course sociological research that individual functioning is influenced by sociocultural contexts.

Randomized Trial of Promoting First Relationships for New Mothers Who Received Community Mental Health Services in Pregnancy	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The effectiveness of Promoting First Relationships (PFR), a 10-week home visiting program with video feedback, was tested in a randomized controlled trial involving 252 mothers and their 8- to 12-week-old infants. Mothers were eligible if they initiated treatment after mental health screening (depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) at a community or public health primary care center in pregnancy. At baseline. 51% had mild to severe depression symptoms, 54% had mild to severe anxiety. and 35% had PTSD. Their ages ranged from 18 to 42 years. Mothers were 66% white, 18% Black, and 16% other races. Forty-seven percent identified as Hispanic, and 33% preferred to read and speak in Spanish. The median family annual income was less than $20,000. The PER program or receipt of a resource packet (control condition) followed the baseline assessment and randomization: we assessed outcomes when infants were age 6 and 12 months. Compared to mothers in the control condition, mothers in the PFR condition had significantly (ps < .05) higher observed sensitivity scores at both follow-up time points (d = .25, d = .26), had improved understanding of infant-toddler social-emotional needs at both time points (d = .21, d = .45), and reported less infant externalizing behavior at age 12 months (d = .28). This study is the fourth completed randomized controlled trial of the PFR program, all involving populations experiencing adversity.

Physiological Stress, Sustained Attention, Emotion Regulation, and Cognitive Engagement in 12-Month-Old Infants From Urban Environments	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Over the last 2 centuries there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of children who grow up in cities. However, relatively little work has explored in detail the physiological and cognitive pathways through which city life may affect early development. To assess this, we observed a cohort of infants growing up in diverse settings across South East England across a 2-day assessment battery. On Visit I, day-long home recordings were made to monitor infants' physiological stress in real-world settings. On Visit 2, lab batteries were administered to measure infants' cognitive, emotional, and neural reactivity. Infants from more high-density urban environments showed increased physiological stress (decreased parasympathetic nervous system activity) at home. This relationship was independent of socioeconomic status and lifelong stressors. Behaviorally, infants raised in high-density settings showed lower sustained attention in the lab, along with increased behavioral and physiological reactivity during an emotion elicitation task. However, they also showed increased recognition memory for briefly presented stimuli and increased neural engagement with novel stimuli. This pattern is consistent with other research into how elevated physiological stress influences cognition, and with theoretical approaches from adult research that predict that city life is associated with a profile of cognitive strengths as well as weaknesses. Implications for education and developmental psychopathology are discussed.

Toddlers Link Social and Speech Variation During Word Learning	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Within a language, there is considerable variation in the pronunciations of words owing to social factors like age, gender, nationality, and race. In the present study, we investigate whether toddlers link social and linguistic variation during word learning. In Experiment I, 24- to 26-month-old toddlers were exposed to two talkers whose front vowels differed systematically. One talker trained them on a word-referent mapping. At test, toddlers saw the trained object and a novel object; they heard a single novel label from both talkers. Toddlers responded differently to the label as a function of talker. The following experiments demonstrate that toddlers generalize specific pronunciations across speakers of the same race (Experiment 2), but not across speakers who are simply an unfamiliar race (Experiment 3). They also generalize pronunciations based on previous affiliative behavior (Experiment 4). When affiliative behavior and race are pitted against each other, toddlers' linguistic interpretations are more influenced by affiliative behavior (Experiment 5). These experiments suggest that toddlers attend to and link social and speech variation in their environment.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				AUG	2021	57	8					1195	1209		10.1037/dev0001032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001032								34591565					WOS:000703561700002

A Longitudinal Study With English-Speaking 2-to 3-Year-Olds	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												To examine whether children's acquisition of perspective-marking language supports development in their ability to reason about mental states, we conducted a longitudinal study testing whether proficiency with complement clauses around age 3 explained variance in false-belief reasoning 6 months later. Forty-five English-speaking 2- and 3-year-olds (23 female, Time 1 age range = 33-41 months) from middle-class families in the North-West of England took part in the study. which addresses a series of uncertainties in previous studies. We avoided the confound of using complement clauses in the false-belief tests, assessed complement-clause proficiency with a new comprehensive test designed to capture gradual development, and controlled for individual differences in executive functioning that could affect both linguistic and sociocognitive performance. Further, we aimed to disentangle the influence of two aspects of complement-clause acquisition: proficiency with the perspective-marking syntactic structure itself and understanding of the specific mental verbs used in this syntactic structure. To investigate direction of causality, we also tested whether early false-belief reasoning predicted later complement-clause proficiency. The results provide strong support for the hypothesis that complement-clause acquisition promotes development in false-belief reasoning. Proficiency with the general structure of complement-clause constructions and understanding of the specific mental verbs "think" and "know" in third-person complements at Time I both contributed uniquely to predicting false-belief performance at Time 2. However, false-belief performance at Time 1 also contributed uniquely to predicting complement-clause proficiency at Time 2. Together, these results indicate a bidirectional relationship between linguistic and sociocognitive development.

Contextualizing the Role of Intrusive Parenting in Toddler Behavior Problems and Emotion Regulation: Is More Always Worse?	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Intrusive parenting has been traditionally considered a negative parenting style and includes actions that are overly directive and controlling of children's behavior. However, current research aims to contextualize this parenting behavior. This study examined the relation between intrusive parenting and early childhood behavior problems or emotion regulation, as well as the moderating role of race/ethnicity and developmental delay. Participants (n = 511: 47.4% male) were part of a larger, longitudinal Early Head Start study, entitled Baby FACES, with a racially and ethnically diverse sample (40.1% White, 18.7% Black, and 41.2% Hispanic). Behavior problems and developmental delay were assessed via parent report, while parent intrusiveness and emotion regulation were rated by observers. More use of intrusive parenting at age 2 was associated with greater behavior problems and less emotion regulation at age 3. However, this relation was moderated by race/ethnicity and developmental level. Greater intrusiveness was related to increased behavior problems and poorer emotion regulation for White and Hispanic/Latino families: they were unrelated in Black families. Similarly, although intrusive parenting and behavior problems were positively associated at all developmental levels, the relation was strongest for children with typical development. Further, fewer maternal risk factors, being female. and being Hispanic/Latino were associated with higher emotion regulation, and more risk factors were associated with more behavior problems. These findings highlight the importance of considering how a child's context and development interact with parenting style. Children may benefit from clinical assessment and intervention that considers this intersectionality.

Observational data were collected from Chinese children and their mothers in a laboratory free play session. The results showed that compared with children in the 1995 cohort (207 children, 95 boys, M-age = 24.09 months), children in the 2008 cohort (281 children, 144 boys, M-aga = 24.34 months) displayed fewer connectedness-oriented behaviors and spent more time on autonomous activities. Compared with mothers in the 1995 cohort (45% with a college education), mothers in the 2008 cohort (43.4% with a college education) were less likely to display involvement in children's activities and more likely to encourage child autonomy. The results suggest that macrolevel contexts may play an important role in shaping parenting and children's behaviors.					chen, xinyu/HNR-2708-2023	Chen, Xi/0000-0002-8503-5469													0012-1649	1939-0599				AUG	2021	57	8					1254	1260		10.1037/dev0001224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001224								34591569					WOS:000703561700006

Children's Dove Temperament as a Differential Susceptibility Factor in Child Rearing Contexts	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This multistudy article examines whether children's susceptibility to their socialization experiences varies as a function of their dove temperament dispositions, an evolutionarily informed pattern of traits marked by a low threshold of environmental stimulation and greater behavioral flexibility across environmental contexts. Participants in Study 1 consisted of 70 mothers and their 4- to 6-year-old children: M age = 4.79 years; 57% girls; 33% Black or multiracial; 14% Latinx: median annual income range = $55,000 - $74,999. For Study 2, participants were 243 families. including mothers. fathers. and preschool children: M age = 4.60 years; 56% girls; 54% Black or multiracial. 16% Latinx: median annual income = $36,000). The studies used multimethod, multiinformant measurement batteries within a cross-sectional design (i.e., Study 1) or longitudinal design with three annual measurement occasions (i.e., Study 2). Study 1 findings indicated that associations among maternal parenting quality and psychological problems were only significant for children who were high in dove temperament. Consistent with these findings, Study 2 latent growth curve analyses showed that children experiencing high family adversity (i.e., maternal and paternal parenting difficulties, interparental conflict) were more susceptible to subsequent internalizing and social problems only when they were high in dove temperament. Supporting its role as a susceptibility factor, findings revealed that children with dove temperaments evidenced lower levels of psychological problems under supportive family conditions and higher psychological difficulties in adverse family contexts. Analyses further showed that the composition and moderating effects of dove temperament were distinct from other temperamental susceptibility candidates.

Mexican-Origin Families Coping Together: Does Family Coping Predict Child Coping?	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Family is an important context for the development of adaptive child coping. Further, both family and child coping can promote positive mental health. This study examines whether family coping predicts child coping over 1 year among Mexican-origin immigrant families. Participants included 104 families with a child aged 6 -10 years (M-age = 8.39, 61% female) and at least 1 Mexican-origin parent. The majority of primary caregivers (M-age = 37.13) identified as female (97%), while 82% of secondary caregivers (M-age = 43.14) identified as male. Family income was 150% of the poverty line or below. Families completed video-recorded interaction tasks and family coping strategies were coded. Caregivers completed surveys on children's coping. Family problem solving was associated with child primary and secondary control coping concurrently and predicted less use of disengagement over time. Family refraining was linked to less disengagement concurrently, and predicted child secondary control coping over time. Family coping may promote adaptive child coping among immigrant families.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				AUG	2021	57	8					1291	1296		10.1037/dev0001216	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001216								34591572					WOS:000703561700009
J	Forsberg, A; Blume, CL; Cowan, N				Forsberg, Alicia; Blume, Christopher L.; Cowan, Nelson			The Development of Metacognitive Accuracy in Working Memory Across Childhood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Growth in working memory capacity, the number of items kept active in mind. is thought to be an important aspect of childhood cognitive development. Here, we focused on participants' awareness of the contents of their working memory, or meta-working memory, which seems important because people can put cognitive abilities to best use only if they are aware of their limitations. In two experiments on the development of meta-working memory in children between 6 and 13 years old and adults, participants were to remember arrays of colored squares and to indicate if a probe item was in the array. On many trials, before the probe recognition test, they reported a metajudgment, how many items they thought they remembered. We compared meta-working memory judgments to actual performance and looked for associations between these measures on individual and trial-by-trial levels. Despite much lower working memory capacity in younger children there was little change in meta-working memory judgments across age groups. Consequently, younger participants were much less realistic in their metajudgments concerning their working memory capability. Higher cognitive capacity was associated with more accurate meta-working memory judgments within an age group. Trial-by-trial tuning of metajudgments was evident only in young adults and then only for small array set sizes. In sum, meta-working memory ability is a sophisticated skill that develops with age and may be an integral aspect of the development of working memory across the school years.

Shelby; Ahl, Richard E.; McAuliffe, Katherine			Trustworthiness Is Distinct From Generosity in Children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Interpersonal trust is a key component of cooperation, helping support the complex social networks found across societies. Trust typically involves two parties, one who trusts by taking on risk through investment in a second party, who can be trustworthy and produce mutual benefits. To date, the developmental literature has focused primarily on the trustor, meaning we know little about the ontogeny of trustworthiness. Whereas trusting can be motivated by self-interest, one-shot trustworthiness is more squarely situated in the prosocial domain, involving a direct tradeoff between self-interest and others' interests. However, this raises the question of whether trustworthiness is distinct from generosity. In this preregistered study, we examine the origins of trustworthiness using an intuitive version of the Trust Game, in which a first party invests resources in a second party who can split the gains. We recruited N = 118 5-to-8 year-old American children (M-age = 6.94, n = 59 girls, 57% White. 88% of parents with bachelor's degree or higher), split between the Trustworthiness condition, where another party's investment is instrumental for obtaining greater resources, and the Generosity condition, where the other party is a passive recipient. We found that children in the Trustworthiness condition shared significantly more resources than those in the Generosity condition. Further, children in the Trustworthiness condition predicted that the first party expected them to share a greater number of resources. Overall, these results demonstrate that trustworthiness is distinct from generosity in childhood and suggest that children spontaneously grasp and engage in a key aspect of cooperation.

J	Arini, RL; Wiggs, L; Kenward, B				Arini, Rhea L.; Wiggs, Luci; Kenward, Ben			Moral Duty and Equalization Concerns Motivate Children Third-Party Punishment	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Although children enact third-party punishment, at least in response to harm and fairness violations, much remains unknown about this behavior. We investigated the tendency to make the punishment fit the crime in terms of moral domain; developmental patterns across moral domains; the effects of audience and descriptive norm violations; and enjoyment of inflicting punishment. We tested 5- to 11-year-olds in the United Kingdom (N = 152 across two experiments, 55 girls and 97 boys, predominantly White and middle-class). Children acted as referees in a computer game featuring teams of players: As these players violated fairness or loyalty norms, children were offered the opportunity to punish them. We measured the type (lining or banning) and severity of punishment children chose and their enjoyment in doing so. Children only partially made the punishment fit the crime: They showed no systematic punishment choice preference for disloyal players, but tended to fine rather than ban players allocating resources unfairly-a result best explained by equalization concerns. Children's punishment severity was not affected by audience presence or perpetrators' descriptive norm violations, but was negatively predicted by age (unless punishment could be used as an equalization tool). Most children did not enjoy punishing. and those who believed they allocated real punishment reported no enjoyment more often than children who believed they pretended to punish. Contrary to picdictions, retribution was not a plausible motive for the observed punishment behavior. Children are likely to have punished for deterrence reasons or because they felt they ought to.

J	Yüksel, AS; Palmer, SB; Rutland, A				Yuksel, Ayse Sule; Palmer, Sally B.; Rutland, Adam			Developmental Differences in Bystander Behavior Toward Intergroup and Intragroup Exclusion	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examined prosocial bystander behavior in an online ball-throwing game (Cyberball), toward the exclusion of immigrants and nonimmigrant peers within intergroup and intragroup contexts. Participants were British children (8- to 10-year-olds) and adolescents (13- to 15-year-olds. N = 292; female N = 144). They were an ethnically diverse low-to-middle SES sample from a South Asian, White, Black, or mixed ethnic background. Participants played the game and witnessed a victim being excluded by peers. The victim's and excluders' group membership and status were highlighted in a prototypical (i.e., majority status peers excluding a minority status victim) or nonprototypical (i.e., minority status peers excluding a majority status victim) intergroup context. In intragroup contexts exclusion involved peers from the same group (i.e., majority status peers excluding a majority status victim or minority status peers excluding a minority status victim). Prosocial bystander behavior and "verbal" reactions to the exclusion were measured. Adolescents showed more prosocial bystander behavior than children when it was an intergroup context but not when it was an intragroup context. Only adolescents showed more prosocial bystander behavior when the intergroup context was prototypical compared to nonprototypical. Verbal reactions were related to prosocial bystander behavior and, with age, individuals increasingly verbally challenged the exclusion and the motivation behind it. The findings support the Social Reasoning Developmental (SRD) approach to social exclusion by showing that from late childhood into midadolescence bystander behavior is increasingly related to group membership and group status of the excluders and victim.					yuksel, ayse/GYD-5187-2022	Palmer, Sally/0000-0003-2198-2106; Yuksel, Ayse Sule/0000-0002-9319-5497													0012-1649	1939-0599				AUG	2021	57	8					1342	1349		10.1037/dev0001202	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001202								34591576					WOS:000703561700013

Integrating social identity development theory and the developmental peace-building model. we investigated whether preferences for ethno-religious ingroup symbols mediate the link from child age to outgroup prosocial giving among 5- to 11-year-old children from both majority and minority backgrounds in three settings of protracted intergroup conflict (N = 713, M = 7.97, SD = 1.52. 52.6% female). Participants represented the conflict rival ethno-religious groups in each setting (Northern Ireland [n = 299]: 48.5% Protestant, 51.5% Catholic; Kosovo [n = 220]: 54.1% Albanian. 45.9% Serbian; Republic of North Macedonia [RNM; n = 194]: 45.9% Macedonian. 54.1% Albanian) and were largely from lower- to middle-class families; 4% of participants from other ethnic backgrounds were excluded from the current analyses. Multiple-group, bias-corrected bootstrapped mediation found that ingroup symbol preference mediated the link from child age to outgroup prosocial giving; that is, older children expressed higher ingroup symbol preference, which was linked with lower outgroup giving. Across Northern Ireland. Kosovo, and the RNM, there was some significant variation in the strength of specific paths; however, there was a significant indirect effect in all three settings. The findings advance cross-cultural understanding of how age relates to ingroup symbol preferences and outgroup prosocial giving across the elementary school years. with implications for children's long-term peace-building contributions in three conflict-affected societies.

Intensive longitudinal studies suggest that these beneficial effects can also be observed on a day-to-day level. However, the dynamic interplay between subjective sleep quality and affective well-being in children's daily life has only rarely been investigated. The aims of the present work were (a) to replicate findings from a prior ambulatory assessment study in this area (Konen et al.. 2016). (b) to explore the effect of subjective sleep quality on well-being throughout the day, and (c) to examine the reciprocal relation between subjective sleep quality and well-being in more detail. Data from two ambulatory assessment studies with children between 8 and 11 years (N = 108/84, with assessments over 28/21 consecutive days) consistently showed that positive affect was higher and negative affect was lower after nights with better sleep quality, and that the effects of subjective sleep quality were stronger on well-being assessed in the morning compared with later in the day. Results from dynamic structural equation models revealed reciprocal effects of subjective sleep quality and positive affect. Negative affect was not consistently related to worse subsequent sleep quality after controlling for positive affect and prior night's sleep quality. Results suggest a close relation of sleep quality and positive affect, which strengthens the idea behind interventions targeting both, children's sleep and well-being. Differences between children in the dynamic interplay between sleep and affect may be important predictors of long-term outcomes.

J	Bernstein, DM				Bernstein, Daniel M.			Hindsight Bias and False-Belief Reasoning From Preschool to Old Age	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Participants ranging in age from 3 to 98 years (N = 708; approximately 60% female; 49% Caucasian, 38% Asian; 12% Other ethnicities, 1% Indigenous; modal household income > $80,000) completed a battery of tasks involving verbal ability, executive function, and perspective-taking. Wherever possible, all participants completed the same version of a task. The current study tested hindsight bias and false-belief reasoning to determine how these constructs relate to each other across the child-to-adult life span. Participants of all ages showed robust hindsight bias and false-belief reasoning errors. Hindsight bias followed a U-shaped function, wherein preschoolers and older adults showed more hindsight bias than older children and younger adults. False-belief reasoning, conversely, was relatively constant from preschool to older adulthood. Hindsight bias did not correlate with false-belief reasoning. We conclude that hindsight bias and false-belief reasoning errors are robust but unrelated cognitive biases across the life span.

However, evaluation of this topic has been hindered by a lack of representative. longitudinal data from different aged cohorts measured on the same cognitive tests. Gender differences in cognitive abilities were evaluated in three population-based cohorts (baseline age-span 20 to 76, 52% female, 94% Caucasian, 5% Asian and 1% other ethnic background. baseline N = 7,485), initially drawn from the electoral role in Australia where voting is compulsory, that were assessed four times over 12 years on measures of verbal memory, processing speed, working memory, verbal ability, and reaction time. Linear mixed models showed that within each cohort, women had better verbal memory and men had better working memory and faster reaction times. Verbal ability and processing speed showed variable gender differences in the young and middle-aged cohorts but no difference in the oldest cohort. In young and middle age, there were no gender differences in rates of change in verbal memory, processing speed, reaction time, verbal ability, or working memory. In old age, the gender differences were only observed in rates of change in verbal memory. Women showed more verbal memory decline between the 8-year and 12-year follow-ups than men, despite retaining higher average memory performance than men. We conclude that from ages 20-76. gender differences in cognitive abilities are stable except for faster memory ageing among women in the eighth decade.

Examining a Developmental Pathway From Early Behavioral Inhibition to Emotion Regulation and Social Anxiety: The Moderating Role of Parenting	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We examined the longitudinal relation between behavioral inhibition (BI) and social anxiety symptoms and behavior and the mediating role of emotion regulation (ER). Moreover, we investigated the influence of parenting behavior on the development of ER strategies. Participants were 291 children (135 male) followed longitudinally from 2 to 13 years. Mothers were predominantly well educated and non-Hispanic Caucasian. Children were screened for BI using maternal report and observational measures (ages 2 and 3), parenting behavior was observed while children and their mothers participated in a fear-eliciting task (age 3). ER strategies were observed while children completed a disappointment task (age 5), and socially anxious behavior was measured via multimethod assessment at 10 and 13 years. Children who exhibited high BI in early childhood exhibited more socially anxious behavior across ages 10 and 13. and there was a significant indirect effect of BI on socially anxious behavior through ER strategies. Children who were high in BI demon-strated less engaged ER strategies during the disappointment task, which in turn predicted more socially anxious behavior. Furthermore, parenting behavior moderated the pathway linking early BI and ER strategies to social anxiety outcomes such that children who exhibited high BI and who received more affectionate/oversolicitous behavior from their mother displayed less engaged ER strategies and more socially anxious behavior than children low in BI or low in oversolicitous parenting behaviors. These findings expand on our understanding of the role that ER strategies and parenting play in the developmental pathway linking early BI to future social anxiety outcomes.

Genetic and Environmental Contributions to Co-Occurring ADHD and Emotional Problems in School-Aged Children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often experience co-occurring emotional problems. ADHD with this comorbidity is associated with poorer outcomes than ADHD without comorbidity. Better understanding of the etiology of comorbidity could improve prevention of negative outcomes for children with ADHD. The sample consisted of 567 twin pairs. 3,632 sibling pairs, and 2,340 cousin pairs from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study. Mothers rated offspring symptoms of ADHD, anxiety, and depression at 8 years of age. Biometric modeling was performed to examine genetic and environmental contributions to co-occurring symptoms of AI)HD and emotional problems in the children. We fitted four variable (inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity. anxiety. and depression) covariance matrices of additive genetic, common environmental, twin- and individual-specific environmental effects. Genetic, shared environmental, and individual-specific environmental factors contributed to the correlation between ADHD and depression. The pattern was similar for both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. Familial risk factors (genetic and shared environment), but not individual-specific environmental factors contributed to the positive correlations between each of the two ADHD subdomains and anxiety. The genetic contributions to ADHD-depression comorbidity only partly overlapped with genetic contributions to ADHD-anxiety comorbidity. Our findings indicate that shared risk factors for ADHD and comorbid depression were familial as well as individual-specific, while shared risk factors for ADHD and comorbid anxiety were primarily familial.

Developmental Changes in Natural Scene Viewing in Infancy	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We extend decades of research on infants' visual processing by examining their eye gaze during viewing of natural scenes. We examined the eye movements of a racially diverse group of 4- to 12-month-old infants (N = 54; 27 boys; 24 infants were White and not Hispanic, 30 infants were African American, Asian American, mixed race and/or Hispanic) as they viewed images selected from the MIT Saliency Benchmark Project. In general, across this age range infants' fixation distributions became more consistent and more adult-like, suggesting that infants' fixations in natural scenes become increasingly more systematic. Evaluation of infants' fixation patterns with saliency maps generated by different models of physical salience revealed that although over this age range there was an increase in the correlations between infants' fixations and saliency, the amount of variance accounted for by salience actually decreased. At the youngest age, the amount of variance accounted for by salience was very similar to the consistency between infants' fixations, suggesting that the systematicity in these youngest infants' fixations was explained by their attention to physically salient regions. By 12 months, in contrast, the consistency between infants was greater than the variance accounted for by salience, suggesting that the systematicity in older infants' fixations reflected more than their attention to physically salient regions. Together these results show that infants' fixations when viewing natural scenes becomes more systematic and predictable, and that predictability is due to their attention to features other than physical salience.

Sustained Attention Across Toddlerhood: The Roles of Language and Sleep	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The present study examined individual differences in the development of sustained attention across toddlerhood, as well as how these individual differences related to the development of language and sleep. Toddlers (N = 314; 54% male) were assessed at 30, 36, and 42 months using multiple measures of attention, a standardized language assessment, and actigraphic measures of sleep. Toddlers were 80% White. Family socioeconomic status (SES) was calculated using the Hollingshead Four Factor Index and ranged from 13 to 66 (M = 47.59, SD = 14.13). Aims were (a) to examine associations between measures of attention across situations, informants, and time; (b) to consider the independent and interactive effects of language and sleep on attention; and (c) to test potential bidirectional associations between sleep and attention. Findings showed attention measures were stable across time but were only weakly linked with each other at 42 months. Attention was consistently linked with language. More variable sleep and longer naps were associated with less growth in sustained attention across time. Nighttime sleep duration interacted with language in that sleep duration was positively associated with attention scores among toddlers with less advanced language, even when SES was controlled. The findings describe an understudied aspect of how sustained attention develops, involving the main effect of consistent sleep schedules and the interaction effect of amount of sleep and child language development. These findings are relevant to understanding early childhood risk for developing attention problems and to exploring a potential prevention target in family sleep practices.

J	Marno, H				Marno, Hanna			Is 2-Year-Old Children's Referential Disambiguation of a Novel Word Primarily Aimed at Identifying the Word Meaning or at Understanding Their Communicative Partner?	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												During everyday conversations, young children are often challenged with the task of correctly identifying the referent of novel words. What is their primary aim when they try to do so? We propose that by being motivated to successfully participate in communicative interactions, children primarily aim at comprehending what the speaker intends to mean in the specific communicative context, rather than understanding what the word conventionally means. This proposal suggests that in the absence of clear referential cues, when referential disambiguation could be guided only by two distinct factors-the novelty of possible referents or the context in which the labeling occurs-children will rather rely on the pragmatic cues of the situation than on the novelty of the objects. To investigate this hypothesis, we tested 132 two-year-old Hungarian children (67 girls and 65 boys) in a referential disambiguation paradigm. Confirming our prediction, children identified the referent by inferring the intended meaning of the speaker, and not by relying on the novelty of the objects. Thus, when pragmatic cues are provided, children primarily rely on these cues to understand the intended meaning of the speaker. We suggest that this inference to the intended meaning of the speaker might serve most of the times as the input of children's word acquisition processes.

Canadian children were assessed twice, in Grade 2 and Grade 3 (N = 244; 55% girls). All families were English-speaking, and parent education levels ranged from high school to postgraduate, with a median of community college. In Grade 2, children completed general cognitive tasks (i.e., receptive vocabulary, working memory, nonverbal reasoning, and inhibitory control). In both grades, children completed single-digit addition and complementary subtraction problems. In Grade 3, they completed single-digit multiplication problems and measures of applied mathematics, specifically, word-problem solving, algebra, and measurement. We found that addition and subtraction were reciprocally related (controlling for cognitive skills). Subtraction fluency predicted multiplication in Grade 3, whereas addition fluency did not. In Grade 3, both subtraction and multiplication fluency were predictors of applied mathematics, with multiplication partially mediating the relation between subtraction and applied mathematics performance. These findings support the view that learning arithmetic associations is a hierarchical process. As students practice each new skill, individual differences reflect the integration of the novel component into the developing associative network.

Evidence From Young Children's Active Search and Predictions in a Multiple-Cue Inference Task	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												To successfully navigate an uncertain world, one has to learn the relationship between cues (e.g., wind speed, atmospheric pressure) and outcomes (e.g., rain). When learning, it is possible to actively manipulate the cue values to test hypotheses about this relationship directly. Across two studies, we investigated how 5- to 7-year-olds actively learned cue-outcome relationships, and what their behavior revealed about how they represented the hypothesis space. Children learned how two cues (color and shape) predicted some monsters' relative speed, by selecting which monster pairs to see racing. We compared two computational models in their ability to capture children's behavior: a cue-abstraction model, which organizes the hypothesis space based on abstracted cue-outcome relationships, and a permutation-based model, which represents the hypothesis space based on the relative speed of individual monsters. The results of Study 1 (26 five-year-olds, 14 female and 25 six-year-olds, 15 female; predominantly White, fluent in English) provided the first evidence that 5- and 6-year-olds can use cue-abstraction hypothesis space representations when provided with scaffolding. However, Study 2 (65 five-year-olds, 33 female; 67 six-year-olds, 33 female; 68 seven-year-olds, 33 female; predominantly White, fluent in German) showed that young children were best described by the permutationbased model, and that only 7-year-olds, when provided with memory aids, were best captured by the cue-abstraction model. Overall, our results highlight the guiding role of the hypothesis space for active search and learning, suggesting that these two phases might trigger different representations, and indicating a developmental shift in how children represent the hypothesis space.

Children's Spontaneous Associations With Targets Who Differ by Race and Emotional Expression	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Across three studies, we examined non-Black children's spontaneous associations with targets who differed by both race and emotional expression. Children aged 5 to 10 years (N = 419; 215 girls; 58% White; 65% of household incomes.$75,000/year) completed Implicit Association Tests (IAT; Greenwald et al., 2003) containing smiling Black and neutral White target faces. In all three studies, when children categorized these faces by emotional expression, they showed relatively more positive associations with smiling Black targets over neutral White targets, as compared with when they categorized these faces by race. This was the case when children were shown how to categorize these faces (Studies 1 and 2) and when they spontaneously categorized by race or emotional expression on an Ambiguous-Categorization IAT that allowed for categorization by race and/or emotion (Studies 2 and 3). In Study 3, after watching an adult explain that she was categorizing racially diverse faces by emotional expression in a seemingly unrelated card-sorting task, children were also relatively faster to pair smiling Black faces with pleasant images and neutral White faces with unpleasant images on this Ambiguous-Categorization IAT compared with children in a control condition. Older children were more likely to spontaneously categorize primarily by race (Studies 2 and 3) but were also more likely to categorize by emotion following the intervention (Study 3) compared with younger children. Together, these studies provide insight into children's social categorization processes and spontaneous associations with targets who differ systematically across multiple perceptually salient categories.

J	Tikotzky, L; Volkovich, E; Meiri, G				Tikotzky, Liat; Volkovich, Ella; Meiri, Gal			Maternal Emotional Distress and Infant Sleep: A Longitudinal Study From Pregnancy Through 18 Months	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This longitudinal study examined whether changes in maternal emotional distress (depressive, anxiety, and parenting-stress symptoms) predict changes over time in subjective and objective infant sleep. We recruited 226 Israeli expectant mothers (M-age 28.8 +/- 3.3), most representing the middle-upper socioeconomic class. Maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed in the third trimester of pregnancy. After delivery (3, 6, 12, and 18 months), infant sleep quality and duration were assessed for 5 nights using actigraphy and the Brief Infant Sleep Questionnaire. Maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms were reassessed, and maternal parenting-stress was measured at all postpartum assessments. The findings demonstrated significant correlations between maternal emotional distress and mothers' subjective ratings of infant sleep problems (rs > .16 and, < .46). Latent trajectory analyses indicated no significant effects of changes in maternal emotional distress variables on changes in infant subjective or objective sleep. Post hoc power analyses demonstrated that we had enough statistical power to reject the null hypothesis. The results suggest that mothers with higher emotional distress symptoms-and especially those with parenting-stress symptoms-are more likely to experience their infant's sleep as problematic. However, our results challenge the assumption that maternal emotional distress symptoms contribute to infant sleep disturbances over time. The findings are relevant to mothers with mild to moderate emotional distress symptoms and must not be generalized to mothers who experience major clinical depression. Future studies should evaluate whether maternal emotional distress interacts with other risk factors, such as infant temperament, to predict infant sleep disturbances.

However, it is still unclear whether chronic and transient symptoms relate differently to child behavior. The aim of this prospective longitudinal study (N = 193) was to investigate the associations between anxiety and depression symptomatology in a community sample across the first 12.5 years of parenthood, and children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Maternal anxiety and depression were measured at the child's age of 3, 6, and 12 months, and 2.5, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12.5 years. At 12.5 years of age, both mothers and children reported on children's internalizing and externalizing problems. Trait-state occasion modeling was used to disentangle the chronic (trait) part of maternal symptomatology from the transient (occasion-specific) part. On average, 66.6% of the variance in maternal anxiety and depression symptomatology could be explained by the chronic trait factor. For both anxiety and depression, the chronic variance in maternal symptomatology was related to mother-reported internalizing, but not externalizing, problems of the child. Also, for childreported internalizing problems, a significant association with maternal anxiety and depression symptomatology emerged. Only the occasion-specific part of maternal depression symptomatology at the child's age of 12.5 years was marginally related to mother-reported internalizing problems. Given that chronic subclinical symptomatology seems to be associated with child internalizing problems, prevention and treatment of maternal anxiety and depression symptomatology might be worthwhile regardless of the degree of severity.					de Weerth, Carolina/I-7963-2018; van Straten, Annemieke/P-8495-2019; de Weerth, Carolina/KTI-0641-2024; Denissen, Jaap/H-2180-2013	Donker, Tara/0000-0002-7470-8234; de Weerth, Carolina/0000-0002-0921-1811; van Straten, Annemieke/0000-0001-6875-2215; Denissen, Jaap/0000-0002-6282-4107													0012-1649	1939-0599				JUL	2021	57	7					1124	1135		10.1037/dev0001203	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001203								34435827					WOS:000691748500008
J	Brass, NR; Ryan, AM				Brass, Nicole R.; Ryan, Allison M.			Changes in Behavioral Correlates of Social Status During Early Adolescence: Does School Context Matter?	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study investigated the role of school context in changes in the behaviors associated with having high social status during early adolescence. Three waves of surveys were collected from students (N = 542, 53% girls; 44% Black, 44% White, 5% Hispanic/Latinx, and 7% other; 60% free/reduced-fee lunch) in the middle of their sixth, seventh, and eighth grade school years. Peer nominations were used to assess two types of social status (peer acceptance and popularity) and three behavioral reputations (academic, prosocial, and physical aggression). Approximately half of the students made a transition from an elementary school to a larger middle school after sixth grade and the other half attended the same school from kindergarten through eighth grade (K-8). Across time and school configurations, students who were wellliked were perceived to be academically oriented, prosocial, and not physically aggressive. In contrast, the reputations of popular students differed in the two school configurations. In the K-8 context, popularity became increasingly associated with academic and prosocial behavior, and less characterized by physical aggression over time. In the transition context, popularity was associated with academic and prosocial behavior in elementary school, but these associations were null upon the transition to middle school in seventh grade. When students moved into eighth grade, popular students were increasingly academically oriented. In the transition group, popularity was also characterized by physical aggression at all three grades. Findings highlighted the significance of school context for the development of popularity.

To better understand how core executive functions change over time, influence each other, and are affected by chronic stress exposure, a prospective cohort study was conducted from 2016 to 2019. Five hundred sixteen German adults aged 25-55 years (mean age/education age: 38.0/11.3 years, 67% females, 94% occupied, 20% smokers) completed at least one internet-based biannual assessment of response inhibition, updating, and set shifting using a Go/NoGo, spatial 2-Back, and Number-Letter task, respectively. Chronic stress exposure was indicated by self-reports on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and hair cortisol concentrations (HCC). Statistical analyses were performed by multivariate stochastic differential equation modeling. All indicators of executive functions (task-specific RTs in target trials or their contrast to nontarget trials) and chronic stress showed intraindividual stability over time (12% to 63% of their variance was attributable to trait influences). With respect to lagged mutual associations, faster Go/NoGo target RTs predicted faster Number-Letter target RTs later in time, while faster Number-Letter target RTs predicted higher HCC later in time (both with maximum effect sizes of d approximate to 0.1 standard deviations). However, PSS was not predictive of later HCC and vice versa. None of the chronic stress indicators significantly predicted indicators of executive functions at subsequent time points. These findings suggest that set shifting is capable of modulating the body's physiological response to chronic stress exposure, whereas executive functions appear comparably robust against chronic stress exposure.

Educational Growth Trajectories in Adulthood: Findings From an Inner-City Cohort	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Educational attainment is typically examined as a static status. As adult learners have become the new trend in higher education, the changes in educational attainment in adulthood warrant more attention. Using data from the Chicago Longitudinal study (CLS), an ongoing panel investigation of 1,539 children, predictors of educational growth trajectories in adulthood were investigated. Of the study sample (N = 1,418), 51.8% were women, 93.2% were Black, 6.8% were Hispanic, 83.4% were eligible for free lunch between birth and age 3. The average age of the study sample in June 2015 was 35.1, ranging from 34.4 to 36.6. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) was used to analyze the changes in educational attainment between ages 24 and 35. Findings indicate that mothers not completing high school by child's age 3 and days of absence at school were significantly associated with lower educational attainment at age 24. Classroom adjustment, student college expectations, 8th grade reading scores, and ontime high school graduation were significantly associated with higher educational attainment at age 24. Classroom adjustment, 8th grade reading score, and on-time high school graduation were significantly associated with a positive growth of education between ages 24 and 35. Findings suggest that improving academic achievement and socioemotional learning skills in elementary and middle school and promoting on-time high school graduation are likely to increase one's chances to continue pursuing higher education in adulthood for Black low-income children.

Observing Others' Joint Attention Increases 9-Month-Old Infants' Object Encoding	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												In direct interactions with others, 9-month-old infants' learning about objects is facilitated when the interaction partner addresses the infant through eye contact before looking toward an object. In this study we investigated whether similar factors promote infants' observational learning from third-party interactions. In Experiment 1, 9-month-old typically developing infants from mixed socioeconomic backgrounds from urban Germany (N = 32, 13 female) were presented with four types of videos showing one object and two adults. The scenarios varied systematically regarding the eye contact between the adults (eye contact or no eye contact), and the adults' object-directed gaze (looking toward or away from the object). To assess infants' encoding performance we measured their looking times when seeing the familiarized object subsequently next to a novel object, interpreting an enhanced novelty preference as reversely indicating greater encoding of the familiarized object. Infants showed an increased novelty preference, but only after observing a joint attentional setting during which two adults attended to the familiarized object together (following eye contact). In Experiment 2, we found an identical pattern of results in a matched first-party design in which 9-month-old infants (N = 32, 16 female) were directly addressed by one single adult on screen. Infants' encoding was only enhanced when the adult made eye contact with the infant before looking at an object. Together, this suggests that the capacity to learn through observing others' interactions emerges already in the first postnatal year, and that it may depend on similar factors as infants' learning through direct social engagement.

Show, Give, and Point Gestures Across Infancy Differentially Predict Language Development	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												It is well established that deictic gestures, especially pointing, play an important role in children's language development. However, recent evidence suggests that other types of deictic gestures, specifically show and give gestures, emerge before pointing and are associated with later pointing. In the present study, we examined the development of show, give, and point gestures in a sample of 47 infants followed longitudinally from 10 to 16 months of age and asked whether there are certain ages during which different gestures are more or less predictive of language skills at 18 months. We also explored whether parents' responses vary as a function of child gesture types. Child gestures and parent responses were reliably coded from videotaped sessions of parent-child interactions. Language skills were measured at 18 months using standardized (Mullen Scales of Early Learning) and parent report (MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory) measures. We found that at 10 months, show+give gestures were a better predictor of 18-month language skills than pointing gestures were, yet at 14 months, pointing gestures were a better predictor of 18-month language skills than show+give gestures. By 16 months, children's use of speech in the interaction, not gesture, best predicted 18-month language skills. Parents responded to a higher proportion of shows+gives than to points at 10 months. These results demonstrate that different types of deictic gestures provide a window into language development at different points across infancy.

Maternal Depressive Symptoms and Language Development: The Moderating Role of Child Temperament	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The current study examined the interaction between maternal depressive symptoms and child temperament in predicting subsequent child language skills. Participants were 252 mother-child dyads recruited from the All Our Families longitudinal cohort, a primarily middle-class sample (62.9% completed postsecondary education) from Alberta, Canada (90.5% White, 6% Asian, 3.5% other). Maternal depressive symptoms at age 3, controlling for prenatal depressive symptoms, did not evidence a direct effect on child language skills at age 5 (49.6% males; mean [M] = 5.12 years old, standard deviation [SD] = .11). However, both child surgency and effortful control interacted with maternal depression at age 3 to predict later language skills. Low effortful control was a risk factor for poorer language abilities in contexts of high maternal depressive symptoms. High child surgency emerged as a differential susceptibility marker, predicting poorer language skills in contexts of high maternal depressive symptoms but better language skills in contexts of low depressive symptoms. Negative affect did not interact with maternal depressive symptoms in predicting language skills. These findings highlight the complex interaction between maternal and child characteristics in predicting language development during a developmental period in which language skills are a prime indicator of school readiness and a predictor of future academic achievement and socioemotional adjustment.

J	Bornstein, MH; Henry, LM; Manian, N				Bornstein, Marc H.; Henry, Lauren M.; Manian, Nanmathi			Language Development in Children of Clinically Depressed Mothers in Remission: Early Experience Effects	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We compared language comprehension and production across the second year of life in children of clinically depressed mothers who later remitted with children of nondepressed mothers. Altogether, 157 mother-child dyads participated: 46 with mothers diagnosed at infant age 5 months as having major, minor, or other depressive disorders who fully remitted by 15 and 24 months and 111 with nondepressed mothers. The majority of mothers (mean [M] age = 32.8 years) were married, European American, and college educated. The groups did not differ on most sociodemographic indices, and analyses controlled for residual group differences in maternal education and child birth order. Children of early clinically depressed mothers understood fewer words at 15 months (by maternal report on the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory [MCDI]) and 24 months (by experimenter-administered Reynell Developmental Language Scales [RDLS]) than children of nondepressed mothers. Children of nondepressed mothers increased in language comprehension from 15 to 24 months, whereas children of early clinically depressed mothers did not. Aggregating over 15 and 24 months, nondepressed mothers reported that their children expressed more words than clinically depressed mothers reported their children expressed; experimenter assessment revealed no difference between the two groups. Maternal clinical depression in the first 5 months is related to reduced language comprehension and production during the second year of life even in children whose mothers remit, indicating an early experience effect of maternal clinical depression in muting child language development. Future research should identify the mechanisms by which this early experience effect occurs to inform targeted early preventative interventions for at-risk children.

In a longitudinal study of 1,058 4-year-old children in rural Pakistan (n = 488 girls), we examined how prior and concurrent levels of home stimulation relate to change in fine motor skills from ages 2 to 4 while controlling for family wealth, maternal education, number of siblings at birth, prior and concurrent measures of children's physical growth and food insecurity, and prior motor skills at age 2. Moreover, we tested whether the association between early home stimulation and subsequent fine motor skills was mediated by physical growth, food insecurity, motor skills at age 2, and concurrent home stimulation. Results revealed that home stimulation at 18 months was positively associated with change in fine motor skills from ages 2 to 4, over and above family socioeconomic resources. This association was mediated by physical growth, food insecurity and motor skills at age 2. In contrast to home stimulation at 18 months, home stimulation at age 4 was positively associated with concurrent motor skills at age 4 when controlling for all antecedent family factors, as well as prior and concurrent measures of physical growth and food insecurity, and prior motor skills at age 2. Findings suggest that the preschool period may be an important window of time when physically and cognitively stimulating experiences at home uniquely relate to variability in fine motor development.

However, the mechanisms and processes underlying these associations remain unclarified. Mothers' insensitivity to children's distress is an especially unique predictor of child maladjustment, yet no study has examined whether or how different types of insensitivity to child distress uniquely affect the development of internalizing problems in children of alcohol-dependent mothers. To bridge these gaps, this study examined longitudinal mediational pathways between maternal alcohol dependence symptoms, 2 types of maternal insensitivity to child distress (disengagement and intrusiveness), and 2 types of child internalizing symptoms (affective and anxiety problems) in a majority Black and Latinx sample of young children (M-age = 2.14 years) and their mothers. Results revealed that maternal disengagement mediated associations between maternal alcohol dependence symptoms and child internalizing problems such that alcohol dependence predicted increased disengagement to children's distress, which subsequently predicted increases in children's affective problems. Maternal alcohol dependence symptoms were not associated with intrusiveness to child distress; however, increased intrusiveness predicted later increases in child anxiety problems. Findings support a differentiated approach to studying maternal insensitivity to child distress, specifically indicating that mothers with alcohol dependence symptoms may be more or less likely to display certain types of insensitivity to child distress which may differentially influence children's risk for internalizing problems.

"There Are No Band-Aids for Emotions": The Development of Thinking About Emotional Harm	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												An understanding of harm is central to social and cognitive development, but harm largely has been conceptualized as physical damage or injury. Less research focuses on children's judgments of harm to others' internal well-being (emotional harms). We asked 5- to 10-year-old children (N = 456, 50% girls, 50% boys; primarily tested in Central New York, with socioeconomic diversity, but limited racial/ethnic or linguistic diversity) to compare emotional and physical harms. In Experiment 1, children compared simple harms (intended and completed) and then scenarios in which the perpetrator's intention did not match the outcome (intended emotional harm, but caused physical harm, or vice-versa). Assessments of the severity of emotional (vs. physical) harm increased with age and depended on the perpetrator's intentions. In Experiment 2, children saw emotional and physical harms that were: Simple (intended and completed); Incomplete (intended, but not completed); or Accidental (not intended, but completed). Children evaluated physical and emotional harms in isolation and then compared the two. Judgments of the relative severity of emotional harm increased with age, but only when intentions and outcomes were both present. This reflected an increase with age in children's perceptions that emotional harm was hurtful, whereas perceptions of physical harm were relatively stable across development. With age, children also increasingly associated emotional harms with longer-term impacts (being remembered and reoccurring). These findings suggest reasoning about the severity, underlying intentions, and duration of emotional harm shifts with age. The results hold implications for moral development, law and psychology, and emotional-harm-related interventions including those addressing bullying.

J	Martin, JW; Martin, S; McAuliffe, K				Martin, Justin W.; Martin, Sophia; McAuliffe, Katherine			Third-Party Punishment Promotes Fairness in Children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Third-party punishment can promote fair behavior. However, the mechanisms by which this happens are unclear. Third-party punishment may increase fair behavior by providing direct feedback, helping shape the behavior of those punished, or through an influence on reputation, by encouraging the transgressor to behave appropriately before a third-party audience. Investigating whether and how third-party punishment leads to fairness in children during middle childhood-a key developmental period in the emergence of fairness-presents an ideal context in which to explore these 2 mechanisms. Six to nine-year-old children (N = 121) allocated resources between themselves and a partner in a forced-choice dictator game. In the Direct Feedback condition, a third party punished if the child chose the less fair option. In the Reputation condition, a third party merely observed the child. In the Baseline condition, no third party was present. We find that the Direct Feedback condition increased fairness relative to the other conditions, especially among younger children. These results highlight an important link between third-party punishment and fairness in children and, more broadly, help clarify the mechanisms through which third-party punishment can influence fair behavior and thereby human cooperation.

Stereotype threat has been proposed as a principal cause of this gender gap. From this perspective, females' performance is affected by fear of confirming a negative stereotype about females' mathematical ability and this stereotype can be activated by an experimental manipulation that reminds females of the stereotype. Yet, evidence of a stereotype threat effect on mathematics performance in childhood and adolescence has been mixed. The present study replicated a highly cited study of stereotype threat among Italian adolescents with a much larger sample of Italian ninth grade (89 male, 75 female, mean age = 14.2) and eleventh grade (84 male, 80 female, mean age = 16.2) public high school students. Performance in tests administered both before and after the experimental manipulations were analyzed with a series of logistic mixed-effects models. Model comparisons confirmed that males performed better than females, but the probability of a stereotype threat effect was infinitesimal. We conclude that Italian adolescent gender differences in mathematics may not be explained by stereotype threat effects.

Distributive Justice in Society and Among Peers: 8-to 14-Year-Olds' Views on Economic Stratification Inform Their Decisions About Access to Opportunities	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examined how children's and adolescents' beliefs about the distribution of wealth in society and the fairness of economic systems informed their behavior, judgments, and reasoning about access to opportunities among peers. The sample included 136 8- to 14-year-olds (47% girls, 60% White, majority middle- to higher-socioeconomic status [SES]) in the United States. Relative to older children, early adolescents viewed economic systems as less fair and wealth as less equally distributed, but still underestimated the true magnitude of existing economic disparities. Importantly, the stronger their system justification beliefs the fewer opportunities participants directed to poor peers over rich peers in an allocation scenario, but the more equally participants believed that wealth should be distributed in society the more opportunities they directed to poor peers. Moreover, participants were more supportive of allocating opportunities to poor peers when they had direct evidence that poor peers had been excluded in the past, and 40% reasoned explicitly about the implications of economic inequality when making their decision. Finally, exploratory associations of family SES and beliefs about distributive justice suggested that experiencing greater economic security may have enabled some participants to more readily critique societal inequality. Together, these findings provide correlational, experimental, and cross-sectional developmental evidence that older children's and early adolescents' beliefs about distributive justice in society inform their decisions about how to address disparities within their sphere of influence.

In Study 1, 4- to 5-year-olds' (N = 99) EFT as measured by a tool saving task was significantly associated with performance on the delay choice task, but this was not the case for other EFT measures. Study 2 compared the performance of 4-to 5-year-olds (N = 130) on the delay choice task when cued to think about either a future, past, or habitual event versus a no-cue baseline. Overall, cuing impaired performance on the delay choice task. Although EFT does show a relation to performance in a delay choice task in preschoolers, deliberately engaging in thought about future events may be too taxing in young children to reliably enhance the ability to make future-oriented decisions.

However, little is known about how such discriminatory expectations emerge. The current contentious sociopolitical climate toward immigrants, especially those of Latinx heritage, has contributed to heightened discrimination against adolescents in this group. The present study examined how experiences of discrimination over time relate to youths' expectations of future occupational barriers among 148 Latinx adolescents at 3 annual waves (82% U.S.-born; 53% female; M-age = 13.54 at Wave 1). Results suggest that Latinx youth report increasing exposure to ethnic-racial discrimination and objectification as a perceived foreigner over time. Moreover, as Latinx youth perceived more ethnic-racial discrimination and foreigner objectification over the course of adolescence they increasingly expected to face racial and ethnic barriers in their future occupations. Implications of these findings for an increasing Latinx youth and working-age population in the United States are discussed.

We also examined a novel mediating mechanism that underlies this effect, namely accuracy of perceived outgroup willingness for intergroup contact. Three annual waves of survey data were used from 1,169 adolescents (M-age = 13.88 at Wave 1; 50% girls; 66% White British, 44% Asian British) whose schools were merged, in a unique intervention that resulted in one school where ethnic groups were evenly mixed (i.e., balanced school) and two White British majority schools (i.e., majority skewed schools). Results showed that positive intergroup contact and attitudes improved more in the balanced school than in the majority skewed schools. In all schools, change in adolescents' positive intergroup contact predicted change in positive intergroup attitudes indirectly via (a) increased accuracy of perceived outgroup willingness for contact and (b) reduced intergroup anxiety. Indirect effects via accuracy of perceived contact willingness were stronger for adolescents who made more negative affective forecasts than for other adolescents. These moderated mediation effects were stronger in the balanced school than in the majority skewed schools. Thus, more balanced ethnic mixing in schools seemed to directly enhance positive intergroup relations and attitudes for all adolescents, but to particularly benefit adolescents who made more negative affective forecasts about positive contact before the school merger.

As part of an accelerated longitudinal study, data were collected from N = 586 Czech adolescents (M-age = 12.34 years, SD =.89, 58.4% female). Data analyses included a series of logistic regressions that controlled for adolescent sex, age, family structure, and socioeconomic status. Findings showed that sleep quality at Wave 1 predicted developmental changes 1 year later (Wave 3) in depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem (ORrange = 1.7-1.8) and 2 years later (Wave 5) in externalizing behaviors (OR = 2.6). Importantly, despite the associations observed with Wave 3 anxiety and deviance, Wave 1 sleep quantity was unrelated to subsequent developmental changes in adjustment measures, both 1 and 2 years later. No sleep effects at all were observed on a variety of measures of academic competence. Study findings underscore the developmental significance of sleep and indicate greater salience of sleep quality vis-a-vis sleep quantity. They also replicate some of the observed relationships found in previous longitudinal work on the sleep-mood link but extend the sleep-adolescent adjustment literature in a number of important ways.

Young adults (N = 1,000, M age = 21.3 years, 52% female; of Spanish or indigenous descent) from working-class families in Santiago, Chile, completed instruments assessing memory, processing speed, mental flexibility, and educational attainment. Iron status was assessed at ages 6, 12, and 18 months, and verbal intelligence, inattention, and sluggish cognitive tempo (SCT) symptoms were assessed at age 10. Results indicated that young adults who had iron-deficiency in infancy had poor executive control at age 21. Severity of iron deficiency during infancy was associated with lower verbal IQ and more frequent inattention and SCT symptoms in childhood, and with lower educational attainment in young adulthood through its effect on inattention. No additional indirect effects were found. Interventions directed toward improving cognitive and attention deficits linked to early-life iron deficiency appear warranted and could alter the course to adult functioning. Further research on the impact of such interventions would be helpful.

J	Rioux, C; Wertz, AE				Rioux, Camille; Wertz, Annie E.			Avoidance of Plant Foods in Infancy	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Infants avoid touching plants. Here we examine for the first time whether infants are also reluctant to touch plant foods. We hypothesized that infants would avoid plant foods because food neophobia-the avoidance of novel foods-is particularly strong for fruits and vegetables. However, we predicted that infants would avoid processed plant foods to a lesser degree than whole leafy plants because they bear the markers of previous human engagement. In a first assessment, we presented 7- to 15-month-old infants, recruited from a predominantly White population around Berlin, Germany (N = 56; 29 girls), with whole plants, processed whole plant foods. and nonplant food controls. We measured infants' latency to touch each object and their social looks toward adults prior to the first touch. In a follow-up assessment 1 year later, participants' caregivers filled out a questionnaire measuring their child's food neophobia. Infants avoided touching both whole plants and processed plant foods, and engaged in more social looking before touching them, relative to their matched controls. However, infants took longer to touch and engaged in more social looking for whole plants than processed plant foods. The follow-up assessment indicated that avoidance of cut plant foods in older infants was related to their food neophobia measured 1 year later. These results demonstrate that (a) infants avoid plant foods. (b) cues of food processing decrease infants' reluctance to touch plant foods relative to unprocessed plants, suggesting that these cues may signal food safety, and (c) avoiding certain types of plant foods in infancy may be a precursor of later food neophobia.

J	Cebioglu, S; Broesch, T				Cebioglu, Senay; Broesch, Tanya			Explaining Cross-Cultural Variation in Mirror Self-Recognition: New Insights Into the Ontogeny of Objective Self-Awareness	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Mirror self-recognition (MSR) is considered to be the benchmark of objective self-awareness-the ability to think about oneself. Cross-cultural research showed that there are systematic differences in toddlers' MSR abilities between 18 and 24 months. Understanding whether these differences result from systematic variation in early social experiences will help us understand the processes through which objective self-awareness develops. In this study, we examined 57 18- to 22-month-old toddlers (31 girls) and their mothers from two distinct sociocultural contexts: urban Canada (58% of the sub-sample were Canadian-born native English-speakers) and rural Vanuatu, a small-scale island society located in the South Pacific. We had two main goals: (a) to identify the social-interactional correlates of MSR ability in this cross-cultural sample, and (b) to examine whether differences in passing rates could be attributed to confounding factors. Consistent with previous cross-cultural research, ni-Vanuatu toddlers passed the MSR test at significantly lower rates (7%) compared to their Canadian counterparts (68%). Among a suite of social interactive variables, only mothers' imitation of their toddlers' behavior during a free play session predicted MSR in the entire sample and maternal imitation partially mediated the effects of culture on MSR. In addition, low passing rates among ni-Vanuatu toddlers could not be attributed to reasons unrelated to self-development (i.e., motivation to show mark-directed behavior, understanding mirror-correspondence, representational thinking). This suggests that differences in MSR passing rates reflect true differences in self-recognition, and that parental imitation may have an important role in shaping the construction of visual self-knowledge in toddlers.

The application of these methods makes it increasingly important to understand the development of infant sensitivity to the perceptual properties implicated in such methods. In light of recent studies that demonstrate the use of pseudoisochromatic plates in testing infants for color vision. we investigated the perceptual contouring abilities required to pass a color-vision test of this type. A total of 115 (51 female) 16- and 19-month-old U.K.-based participants from the Oxfordshire region participated in this study. The evidence collected in this study indicated their ability to systematically fixate a contoured target, but the speed at which they did so was much slower in the younger age group. These findings suggest that the perceptual contouring abilities implicated in this study are still under development in the second year of life, and as such, the results suggest a lower age limit for color-vision tests displayed in this format.

African American and European American participants (N = 153: age range: 8-14 years. M-age = 11.46 years) made predictions about whether afterschool clubs would prefer to include a peer based on race or wealth and reported what they personally thought should happen. Between late childhood and early adolescence, European American participants increasingly expected that afterschool clubs would include a same-wealth peer (even when this peer was of a different race) whereas African American participants increasingly expected that the afterschool clubs would include a same-race peer (even when this peer was of a different level of wealth). Both European American and African American participants themselves thought that the clubs should include a same-wealth peer over a same-race peer, and with age, were increasingly likely to reference perceived comfort when explaining their decision. Future studies on the development of racial preferences will benefit from including wealth status information given that, with age, perceived comfort was associated with same-wealth rather than same-race status.

When Multiracial Individuals Are the Numerical Majority: Children's Racial Attitudes in the Dominican Republic	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The Dominican Republic is a uniquely valuable context in which to study children's racial stereotyping and prejudice, in part because multiracial individuals comprise the majority of the population and race is viewed largely as a continuous rather than dichotomous construct. In two studies, we use developmental and social theories to ground an exploration of Dominican children's racial biases. In studies 1 (n = 54; ages 6-11) and 2 (n = 122; ages 6-11), children were given measures of racial identity. preference, stereotyping, and/or status. As expected, children identified their own race in a manner consistent with others (e.g.. their teachers). Across a variety of tasks, children failed to consistently favor members of a specific racial group- as indicated by differing levels of racial stereotyping and associations of social status with different races. They did, however, sometimes systematically express greater liking of individuals of mixed racial heritage, a finding that was contingent on the modality of assessment (i.e.. whether race was framed as a continuous vs. dichotomous category, and measured via nonforced vs. forced-choice methods). Implications for current theories of racial attitude development are discussed.

Children's Close Counterfactual Reasoning and Emotion Inferences	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												How we feel about an outcome often depends on how close an alternative outcome was to occurring. In four experiments. we investigated whether predominantly White. middle-class. Canadian children (N = 425, Experiments 1-3) and American adults (N = 227, Experiment 4) consider close counterfactual alternatives when inferring other people's emotions. In Experiment 1, 6-year-olds (but not 4- and 5-year-olds) inferred that an agent would feel sadder about winning a mediocre prize if she later found out that a more attractive one could have easily been won. However, children of all ages failed to judge whether the better outcome could have easily happened. In Experiment 2, when 5- and 6-year-olds knew the locations of the prizes beforehand, they inferred that an agent would be equally happy about winning a mediocre prize, regardless if she almost won a better prize or not. Again, they did not recognize when the better outcome was a close counterfactual possibility. In Experiment 3, we included extra cues to the closeness of the alternative and both 5- and 6-year-olds inferred that she would feel sadder about winning a mediocre prize, and 6-year-olds acknowledged that the attractive prize was a close counterfactual alternative. In Experiment 4, adults considered close counterfactuals when inferring emotions. Our findings suggest that close counterfactuals influence children's emotion inferences before they become able to acknowledge their closeness.

DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examined the course and correlates of the happy victimizer tendency-the expectation that harming others to achieve a goal will result in positive emotional outcomes for the transgressor from 4 to 6 years of age in a community sample of Canadian children (N = 150; 50% female; Time 1 M-age = 4.53 years, SD = .30; 33% European background). At each time point, we conducted semistructured interviews with children to assess their emotion expectancies and reasoning in response to hypothetical acts of aggression. Caregivers (84% mothers; 91% college diploma or higher; 41% yearly household income >=$125.000 CAD [approximately $90,500 USD]) provided ratings of children's inhibitory control and sympathy at study onset. Most 4-year-old children expected to feel good after victimizing others, but this tendency declined through age 6. Children higher in sympathy were less likely to happy victimize at age 4, whereas greater inhibitory control predicted faster decreases in happy victimizing over time.

Participants attempted to win a chance game with multiple prizes; the worst prize being a pencil. The game was rigged so that half of the participants lost, and the other half won. Regardless of the game outcome, everyone received a pencil. For winning participants (high-expectation condition), the pencil was worse than the prize they expected: whereas for losing participants (low-expectation condition), the pencil was better than the "nothing" they expected. Participants rated how much they liked and felt about the pencil preoutcome, postoutcome, when imagining having held an alternative prior expectation, and after learning that everyone received a pencil. Results showed that 6- to 10-year-olds and adults with low (vs. high) expectations liked the pencil more, with emotion ratings trending in the same direction. Prior expectations did not influence younger children's affective experiences. More participants with low (vs. high) expectations also expressed a positive outlook about the pencil, which increased with age and correlated with higher postoutcome emotions. More adults than children explained emotions as caused by thoughts, and only adults consistently reasoned that their preferences and emotions would have differed had they held alternative prior expectations. Once knowing that everyone received a pencil, 6- to 10-year-olds and adults liked the pencil more and felt better.

J	Kim, YSG; Quinn, JM; Petscher, Y				Kim, Young-Suk Grace; Quinn, Jamie M.; Petscher, Yaacov			What is Text Reading Fluency and Is It a Predictor or an Outcome of Reading Comprehension? A Longitudinal Investigation	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Text reading fluency refers to the ability to read connected texts with accuracy, speed, and expression (prosody), and has garnered substantial attention as an important skill for reading comprehension. However, two fundamental questions remain-the dimensionality of text reading fluency including text reading efficiency (accuracy and speed) and reading prosody, and the directionality of the relation between text reading fluency and reading comprehension. These questions were addressed using longitudinal data from Grade 1 (M-age = 6.36 years) to Grade 3 (M-age = 8.34 years). Majority of children were White (approximately 60%) and African American (26%) with 39% to 52% from low-SES backgrounds, depending on the grade. Text reading fluency, word reading. listening comprehension, and reading comprehension were measured. Results from confirmatory factor analysis revealed that text reading fluency is a multidimensional construct with a trifactor structure, which has a general factor that captures common ability across text reading efficiency and reading prosody as well as local and specific factors that are unique beyond the general factor. However, the general factor was the most reliable factor, whereas local and specific factors were not reliable. The directionality of the relation between text reading fluency and reading comprehension was addressed by examining two competing structural equation models-text-reading-fluency-as-a-predictor/mediator model and text-reading-fluency-as-an-outcome model-and data supported the former. These results indicate that text reading fluency is a multidimensional construct, and it acts as a predictor. mediating the relations of word reading and listening comprehension to reading comprehension.

This study extended this line of research by examining dependency-specific learning for both adjacent and nonadjacent dependencies concurrently in both adults and children. Seventy adults aged 18 to 64 (40 women, 30 men; Experiment 1) and 64 children aged 10 to 11 years (40 girls, 24 boys; Experiment 2) were tested with a new serial reaction time (SRT) task in which they were trained for 5-8 min on materials comprising equally probable adjacent and nonadjacent dependencies. They were then asked to discriminate between trained and untrained dependencies in a familiarity task. Both adults and children showed implicit concurrent learning of both adjacent and nonadjacent dependencies. The two dependency types were learned to the same extent. However, adults showed a rapid, sustainable. and dependency-specific sensitivity throughout the SRT task while children only showed a dependency-specific sensitivity to violations of expectations after exposure. When the two groups were statistically compared, only adults showed a dependency-specific learning effect after exposure. These findings are in line with the age-related improvement model of dependency learning.

J	West, G; Melby-Lervåg, M; Hulme, C				West, Gillian; Melby-Lervag, Monica; Hulme, Charles			Is a Procedural Learning Deficit a Causal Risk Factor for Developmental Language Disorder or Dyslexia? A Meta-Analytic Review	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Impaired procedural learning has been suggested as a possible cause of developmental dyslexia (DD) and developmental language disorder (DID). We evaluate this theory by performing a series of meta-analyses on evidence from the six procedural learning tasks that have most commonly been used to test this theory: the serial reaction time. Hebb learning, artificial grammar and statistical learning, weather prediction, and contextual cuing tasks. Studies using serial reaction time and Hebb learning tasks yielded small group deficits in comparisons between language impaired and typically developing controls (g = -.30 and -.32. respectively). However. a meta-analysis of correlational studies showed that the serial reaction time task was not a reliable con elate of language-related ability in unselected samples (r = .03). Larger group deficits were. however, found in studies using artificial grammar and statistical learning tasks (g = -.48) and the weather prediction task (g = -.63). Possible reasons for the discrepancy in results from different tasks that all purportedly measure procedural learning are highlighted. We conclude that current data do not provide an adequate test of the theory that a generalized procedural learning deficit is a causal risk factor for developmental dyslexia or developmental language disorder.

Theory and prior work suggest that older siblings are important sources of gender-related information and socialization. However, few studies have investigated the patterns of these associations longitudinally across early childhood. The present study examines the influence of sibling presence and gender composition on the trajectory of early gender-typed behavior and appearance in children from age 2 through 6 in a diverse sample of Dominican American (36%). African American (33%), and Mexican American (31%) mother-child dyads (N = 232; 112 girls, 120 boys) from low-income households in New York City (M = $20,459, SD = 14.632). Results found that children without older siblings spent more time playing with counterstereotypical toys and their mothers' reports indicated similar behavior over the past month (e.g.. a girl playing with toy vehicles and balls; a boy playing with toy kitchen sets and dolls) than children with older siblings. Further, children with at least one other-gender sibling (e.g.. a girl with an older brother) played more frequently with counterstereotypical toys compared with children with only same-gender siblings (e.g.. a girl with only older sisters). Results on the relation between siblings and gender appearance were mixed. Older siblings may thus influence early trajectories of important gender domains (e.g.. toy play). which can have various long-term implications for developing skills and interests.

A Prospective Examination of Neighborhood Social and Cultural Cohesion and Parenting Processes on Ethnic-Racial Identity Among US Mexican Adolescents	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Neighborhood social processes may have important implications for parenting processes and ethnicracial identity (ERI) processes and content in adolescence. Past research suggests that adolescents whose parents engaged in more cultural socialization. an important aspect of parental racial socialization, had higher levels of ERI processes and content. Parenting, however. is also situated within neighborhood contexts and can be influenced by resources available in neighborhoods. For example, having neighbors who share mutual values, trust one another. and appreciate/celebrate one's heritage culture may be a resource that promotes parents' efforts to engage in cultural socialization. We prospectively examined (from (x) over bar (age )= 10.9-15.8 years) a model in which U.S. Mexican parents' perceptions of neighborhood social and cultural cohesion supported parents' engagement in higher levels of cultural socialization and in turn promoted adolescents' ethnic-racial identity processes and content. We tested a longitudinal mediation model with a sample of 749 U.S. Mexican adolescents (30% Mexico born; 48.9% female) and their parents. Mother-adolescent models suggest mothers' perception of neighborhood social and cultural cohesion in late childhood promoted middle adolescents' ERI affirmation via intermediate increases in maternal cultural socialization. Similar patterns were observed for ERI resolution, but only for adolescents whose mothers were born in the United States. We did not find evidence for mediation in the father-adolescent models. Findings are discussed in the context of the promoting nature of socially and culturally supportive neighborhood environments for U.S. Mexican families and adolescents.

GWAS Sequencing Consortium Alcoho	Mechanisms of Parent-Child Transmission of Tobacco and Alcohol Use With Polygenic Risk Scores: Evidence for a Genetic Nurture Effect	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Parent-child similarity is a function of genetic and environmental transmission. In addition, genetic effects not transmitted to offspring may drive parental behavior, thereby affecting the rearing environment of the child. Measuring genetic proclivity directly, through polygenic risk scores (PRSs), provides a way to test for the effect of nontransmitted parental genotype, on offspring outcome, termed a genetic nurture effect in other words, if and how parental genomes might affect their children through the environment. The current study used polygenic risk scores for smoking initiation, cigarettes per day. and drinks per week to predict substance use in a sample of 3,008 twins, assessed prospectively from age 17-29, and their parents, from the Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research. Mixed-effects models were used to test for a genetic nurture effect whereby parental PRSs predict offspring tobacco and alcohol use after statistically adjusting for offspring's own PRS. Parental smoking initiation PRS predicted offspring cigarettes per day at age 24 (beta= .103, 95% CI [.03, .17]) and alcohol use at age 17 (beta = .091, 95% CI [.04, .14]) independent of shared genetics. There was also a suggestive independent association between the parent PRS and offspring smoking at age 17 (beta = .096; 95% CI [.02, .17]). Mediation analyses provided some evidence for environmental effects of parental smoking, alcohol use, and family socioeconomic status. These findings, and more broadly the molecular genetic method used, have implications on the identification of environmental effects on developmental outcomes such as substance use.

J	Farrell, AH; Vaillancourt, T				Farrell, Ann H.; Vaillancourt, Tracy			Examining the Joint Development of Antisocial Behavior and Personality: Predictors and Trajectories of Adolescent Indirect Aggression and Machiavellianism	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Indirect aggression has been associated with antisocial personality traits like Machiavellianism, but there is a lack of evidence on their longitudinal development across adolescence. Therefore, the joint developmental trajectories of adolescent indirect aggression and Machiavellianism across 3 years of high school (Grades 10 to 12) were investigated. Predictors of joint trajectory groups at the start of high school (Grade 9) were also explored. Participants included a sample of 513 individuals (M-age = 14.95 in Grade 10; SD = .37; 56.7% girls; 76.4% White) recruited from a school district that completed self-report measures of indirect aggression and Machaivellianism annually. Self- and parent-report measures of individual differences (e.g.. approval seeking), peer relations (e.g., school bonding), and psychological features (e.g., anxiety) were explored as predictors of the trajectory groups. As predicted, a small subgroup of individuals indicated a high-risk joint trajectory pattern of moderate stable indirect aggression and high stable Machiavellianism. Additional trajectory patterns included a low-risk group indicating low stable indirect aggression and low stable Machiavellianism. and a high Machiavellianism only group indicating low stable indirect aggression and high stable Machiavellianism. Moderate indirect aggression was a better indicator of high Machiavellianism than the reverse. Individual differences, peer relations, and psychological features differentiated these trajectory groups. Findings have implications for the prevention of antisocial traits and behavior among young people.

Approach-Avoidance Conflict and Shyness: A Developmental Investigation	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												One long-standing theoretical model of shyness proposes that the origins and maintenance of shyness are associated with an approach-avoidance motivational conflict (Asendorpf, 1990), such that shy individuals are motivated to socially engage (high approach motivation) but are too anxious to do so (high avoidance motivation). However, this model has not been empirically tested in predicting the development of shyness. In two separate longitudinal studies, we used the Carver and White (1994) Behavioral Inhibition and Activation System (BIS/BAS) scales as a proxy of approach-avoidance motivations and growth curve analyses to examine whether individual differences in these hypothesized motivational tendencies were associated with the development of shyness across 3 years from late childhood to adolescence (Study 1, N = 1284; 49.8% female, M-age = 10.72, SDage = 1.73, M level of parental education fell between associate's degree/diploma and undergraduate degree) and across nearly a decade from emerging adulthood to young adulthood (Study 2, N = 83; 57.8% females, M-age = 23.56 years, SDage = 1.09 years, 92.8% had at least a high school education). Contrary to the approach-avoidance conflict model of shyness, we found that a combination of high BIS/low BAS, not high BIS/high BAS, was associated with relatively higher shyness contemporaneously and across development in both studies. We discuss the processes that might link individual differences in approach-avoidance motivations to the development of shyness in adolescence and young adulthood.

Here we examined to what extent prospectively assessed child abuse and neglect is associated with self-reported symptoms of psychopathology measured from ages 23 through 39 years. controlling for early demographic covariates and self-reponed symptoms of psychopathology measured at age 16 years. The sample included 140 participants from the Minnesota Longitudinal Study of Risk and Adaptation. Participants were 49% female and 69% White/non-Hispanic. At the time of their child's birth, 48% of the mothers were teenagers (M = 20.5 years, SD = 3.74), 65% were single, and 42% had completed less than a high school education. Results indicated that childhood abuse and neglect was robustly associated with symptoms of psychopathology in adulthood. Exploratory analyses focusing on specific parametrizations of abuse/neglect suggested that abuse perpetrated by maternal figures (rather than paternal or nonparental figures) was uniquely associated with high levels of self-reported symptoms of psychopathology in adulthood. We found no evidence that any subtype of abuse and/or neglect or abuse/neglect during any particular phase of development uniquely predicted symptoms of psychopathology after controlling for relevant covariates. These results highlight the long-lasting significance of childhood abuse and neglect for reports of mental health in adulthood.

J	Babineau, M; Legrand, C; Shi, RS				Babineau, Mireille; Legrand, Camille; Shi, Rushen			Variable Forms in French-Learning Toddlers' Lexical Representations	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We investigated toddlers' phonological representations of common vowel-initial words that can take on multiple surface forms in the input. In French. liaison consonants are inserted and are syllabified as onsets in subsequent vowel-initial words, for example, petit hi elephant [little elephant]. We aimed to better understand the impact on children's early lexical representations of this frequent intrusion by consonants by testing whether toddlers store multiple forms for vowel-initial words (e.g.. telephant, zelephant) early in acquisition. Thirty-one Quebec French-learning 30-month-olds completed an eye-tracking experiment (16 girls). Children were predominantly from White, middle-class families living in a large urban area (Montreal). Each trial presented two objects while one of them was named. There were four key trial types: (a) correct vowel-initial (e.g.. fon elephant [pretty elephant]); (b) pragmatically incorrect frequent intrusion (e.g.. joli zelephans, /z/ intrusion [pretty elephants], which is grammatically acceptable but does not correspond to the picture); (c) lexically incorrect frequent intrusion (e.g., joli telephant, /t/ intrusion, as /t/ is a frequent liaison consonant in general but is impossible with foil); (d) lexically incorrect infrequent intrusion (e.g., joli telephant, intrusion, as /g/ is an infrequent liaison consonant and is also impossible with joli). The results showed that target recognition was successful in the frequent /t/- and /z/-intrusion trials and was also evident in the vowel-initial trials, whereas it was impeded in the infrequent /g/-intrusion trials. Our findings demonstrate that French-learning children's early lexicon contains multiple variants for words that are subject to phonological alternations, including frequent liaison-consonant variants.

T.; Merkley, Rebecca; Tremblay, Paul; Zhang, Samuel; De Jesus, Stefanie; Ansari, Daniel			Kindergarteners' Symbolic Number Abilities Predict Nonsymbolic Number Abilities and Math Achievement in Grade 1	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Research has shown that two different, though related, ways of representing magnitude play foundational roles in the development of numerical and mathematical skills: a nonverbal approximate number system and an exact symbolic number system. While there have been numerous studies suggesting that the two systems are important predictors of math achievement, there has been substantial debate regarding whether and how these basic numerical competencies may be developmentally interrelated. Specifically, the causal direction of their relation has been the subject of debate: whether children's approximate number abilities predict later symbolic number abilities (the mapping account) or the other way around (the refinement account). Our sample included 622 kindergarten children (mean age = 62 months, SD = 3.5, 279 females, 75 born outside Canada). whose dot comparison, number comparison. and mixed comparison skills were assessed over three time-points and math achievement assessed over four time-points. We contrasted multiple theoretical predictions of the interrelations between the variables of interest posited by these two developmental accounts using longitudinal random intercept cross-lagged models. Results were most consistent with the refinement account. suggesting that earlier symbolic number ability is consistently the strongest predictor of approximate number ability, mixed-comparison ability, and arithmetic skills. Notably, our results demonstrated that, when individual models are examined in isolation. model fit was adequate or near adequate for all models tested. This highlights the need for future research to contrast competing accounts, as our results suggest the examination of any one account in isolation may not reveal the best fitting developmental model.

This study reports preschool and kindergarten impact findings for the Saint Paul Public School District It is the first impact study of CPC outside of Chicago. After documenting that implementation quality was relatively high on the 6 CPC elements (effective learning, collaborative leadership. aligned curriculum, parent involvement, professional development, and continuity and stability), matched-group analyses of 433 students utilizing propensity score weighting indicated that CPC participants had significantly higher levels of language and literacy proficiency in both preschool and kindergarten than comparison-group participants in the usual district preschool and kindergarten programs. Overall composite effect sizes were .51 SD at the end of preschool and .36 SD at the end of kindergarten, which translate to performance gains of nearly half of a year. At the end of kindergarten, 61.0% of CPC participants met the district's literacy benchmark compared to 47.4% for the comparison group. We also found that parents of CPC participants attended a significantly greater number of school events and workshops. However, no differences favoring CPC were detected for preschool or kindergarten attendance. Impacts were generally similar for Dual Language Learners. Students with 2 years of CPC (preschool and kindergarten) showed better performance in kindergarten reading stage and fluency than comparison group but not compared to the 1-year group. This was similar for Dual Language Learners. Findings indicate that the CPC program shows evidence that it can be effectively scaled and that the program yields impacts in preschool and kindergarten that exceed the usual early childhood programming in Saint Paul.

Children's Perception of Facial Expressions	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study investigated the developing ability of children to identify emotional facial expressions in terms of the contexts in which they generally occur. We presented Dutch 6- to 9-year-old primary school children (N = 164. 98 girls) prototypical contexts for different emotion categories and asked them whether different kinds of facial expressions belonged to those contexts or not, using a 2-alternative forced-choice task. Correct and incorrect responses were quantified into a single index using signal detection theory, representing children's sensitivity to perceive each facial expression as categorically different from each of the others in terms of their prototypical contexts. Results show age-related improvements in identifying facial expressions as belonging to their prototypical contexts. In addition, we found that older children not only made less misidentifications but also misidentified less kinds of facial expressions to the prototypical contexts. Furthermore, the kinds of misidentifications children made suggest that they do not identify facial expressions based on their conceptual emotional valence. Results were discussed from a perceptual learning account.

As an everyday discursive speech type, narrative potentially invites parents and children to explicitly link together, generalize from, and make inferences about representations-that is, to engage in higher-order thinking talk (HOTT). Here we ask whether narratives in early parent-child interactions include proportionally more HOTT than other forms of everyday home language. Sixty-four children (31 girls; 36 White, 14 Black, 8 Hispanic. 6 mixed/other race) and their primary caregiver(s). (M-income = $61.000) were recorded in 90-minute spontaneous home interactions every 4 months from 14-58 months. Speech was transcribed and coded for narrative and HOTT. We found that parents at all visits and children after 38 months used more HOTT in narrative than non-narrative. and more HOYT than expected by chance. At 38 and 50 months, we examined HOTT in a related but distinct form of decontextualized talk-pretend. or talk during imaginary episodes of interaction- as a control to test whether other forms of decontextualized talk also relate to HOTT. While pretend contained more HOTT than other (non-narrative/non-pretend) talk, it generally contained less HOTT than narrative. Additionally. unlike HOTT during narrative, the amount of HOTT during pretend did not exceed the amount expected by chance, suggesting narrative serves as a particularly rich "breeding ground" for HOTT in parent-child interactions. These findings provide insight into the nature of narrative discourse, and suggest narrative potentially may be used as a lever to increase children's higher-order thinking.

For children of single fathers, the study also examined associations between aspects related to their surrogacy conception, feelings about their family arrangement, and behavioral adjustment. All children (47.5% girls) were aged 6-12 years (M-months = 97.84, SD = 20.50) and living in Italy; all fathers (M-years = 43.79; SD = 6.42) identified as cisgender, reported a medium-to-high socioeconomic status, and were White (with the exception of one gay partnered father). No differences were found across the four family groups in any behavioral outcome, with children demonstrating, on average, high levels of self-worth and low levels of internalizing and externalizing problems. In single-father families, regardless of the father's sexual orientation, children with a weaker understanding of surrogacy, lower satisfaction with their contact with the gestational carrier, and lower comfort with their family arrangement were associated with more externalizing problems. Furthermore, children's female gender and lower satisfaction with their contact with the gestational carrier were associated with more internalizing problems, whereas children's male gender and greater understanding of surrogacy were associated with higher self-worth. Taken together. these findings do not support the commonly held assumption that the combination of surrogacy conception and single fatherhood is detrimental for children's behavioral adjustment.

However, no prospective studies of early child care have addressed how these experiences might be reflected in the content of attachment representations during adolescence and beyond. The goal of this study was to estimate relatively precise associations between child care quality, child care quantity, and type of care in the first 54 months of life and the content of adolescents' attachment representations around age 18 years (N = 857; 51% female: 78% White, non-Hispanic; mean income-to-needs ratio = 4.13), leveraging data from the longitudinal National Institute of Child Health arid Human Development (NICHD) study of Early Child Care and Youth Development. We identified a small positive association between the observed quality of early child care (but not quantity or type of care) and secure attachment states of mind as measured by the Adult Attachment Interview (but not the Attachment Script Assessment) at age 18 years that was robust to demographic covariates and observations of maternal and paternal sensitivity during childhood. We observed no significant interactions among child care variables. Associations between early child care experiences and indicators of adolescent attachment were likewise not moderated by maternal sensitivity from infancy to midadolescence or by maternal reports of child temperament in early childhood.

J	Xu, Y; Norton, S; Rahman, Q				Xu, Yin; Norton, Sam; Rahman, Qazi			Childhood Gender Nonconformity and the Stability of Self-Reported Sexual Orientation From Adolescence to Young Adulthood in a Birth Cohort	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study quantified changes in self-reported sexual orientation from adolescence to early adulthood, and whether childhood gender nonconformity (GNC) predicted sexual orientation changes. Youth (2,678 boys and 3,359 girls; 96.09% ethnically White) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) were included. Self-reported sexual orientation was measured using sexual attraction (5-point scale) at ages 15.5, 21, and 23. GNC was measured via Preschool Activities Inventory at ages 2.5. 3.5. and 4.75 years. The prevalence of boys and girls who reported being gay/lesbian increased from 15.5 to 21 years old whereas the proportion of bisexuals was relatively stable for both sexes. Among boys, heterosexuality and being gay were equally stable and relatively more stable compared to bisexuality. Among girls, reporting being lesbian and bisexual were equally unstable and relatively less stable than heterosexuality. Girls reporting being lesbian were more likely to report changes in their sexual orientation than gay adolescent boys. The stability of being lesbian and bisexual among girls, and bisexuality among boys, increased over time. Overall, few people changed their self-reported sexual orientation between ages 21 and 23. GNC at 2.5 years, and changes in GNC from 2.5 to 4.75 years, predicted being lesbian/gay at 15.5, 21, and 23 years and changes from being heterosexual to lesbian/gay from 15.5 to 21 years in each sex. In conclusion. self-reported sexual orientation from adolescence to young adulthood is relatively stable in males compared to females, and childhood GNC is a predictor of any, albeit small, sexual orientation changes.

Changes in Disclosure Stress and Depression Symptoms in a Sample of Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Youth	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Disclosing a sexual minority (e.g., lesbian, gay, or bisexual) identity to others is an ongoing process throughout life. Research shows that disclosure is stressful, and this stress is related to poorer mental health for sexual minority youth. However, there are few theoretically grounded studies examining disclosure stress and its prospective association with mental health. The current study utilizes 2 conceptualizations of sexual identity development-stage models and milestone models-to contextualize how changes in disclosure-related stress arc associated with depression symptoms from adolescence into young. adulthood. Data come from a sample of lesbian. gay, and bisexual youth between ages 15-24 surveyed over 3 years (N = 555; 82% youth of color; 40% bisexual; 63% free and reduced lunch: and 49% assigned female at birth). We estimated (a) parallel process models and (b) growth curve models with disclosure stress as a time-varying covariate. which were respectively informed by stage and milestone conceptualizations of sexual identity development. Results indicated that depression symptoms declined while disclosure stress increased. In the parallel process model, higher baseline disclosure stress correlated with higher baseline levels and steeper declines in depression symptoms. When disclosure stress was modeled as a time-varying covariate, it was most strongly associated with higher depression symptoms at earlier ages. Disclosure is a developmental process that confers differential risk for depression symptoms earlier in the life course, which can hinder the typical decline of depression symptoms in young adulthood. Supporting sexual minority youth when they disclose their sexual identity throughout adolescence can have long-term benefits for mental health.

Patterns of Early Adult Work and Postsecondary Participation Among Individuals With High-Incidence Disabilities: A Longitudinal Person-Centered Analysis	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Interest in the pathways young people take from high school to early adulthood indicates that participation in early employment and postsecondary education facilitates long-term independence, agency, and career stability (Eliason et al., 2015; Shanahan et al.. 2002). Although many adolescents with disabilities do not participate in these early adult experiences at rates commensurate with their normative peers, the overall structure, timing, and persistence of these patterns is not well understood. The current study analyzes data from the National Longitudinal Transition Study 2 (NLTS2) to explore patterns of emerging adult engagement in employment and/or postsecondary school among young adults with high-incidence disabilities across three early adult time points (20 to 25 years old) as well as adolescent precursors to these patterns. The sample was comprised exclusively of youth with disabilities (i.e., learning disabilities, emotional disturbance, and intellectual disability), 32% of participants were students of color, and 23% were from families living below the federal poverty line. Results suggested 3 patterns of adult engagement: dynamically engaged (15%), primarily employed (51%), and primarily unengaged (34%). Student race and disability type were associated with these patterns as were individual skills (e.g., reading, mathematics & social skills), family characteristics (i.e., parent expectations), and school experiences (i.e., peer relationships, extracurricular activities) gathered during high school. These findings shed new light on the patterns of early employment and postsecondary participation among emerging adults with disabilities as well as adolescent predictors of these patterns.

However, the unique contributions of early predictors and changes in these factors to the development of marital satisfaction have been overlooked. Based on data from 268 Chinese newlywed couples (M-age = 29.59. SD = 3.25 for husbands; M-age = 28.08. SD = 231 for wives), the current study used latent growth curve model to examine (a) the development of marital satisfaction and the unique contributions of the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and stress predictors to the developmental trajectories (i.e.. the initial level and change) of marital satisfaction; (b) whether the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and stress predictors develop over time; and (c) how trajectories of these predictor domains are associated with changes in marital satisfaction. The results indicated that interpersonal variables, rather than intrapersonal or stress predictors at baseline, were associated with both the initial levels of and changes in marital satisfaction; in contrast, only the changes in the stress levels were found to be related to changes in marital satisfaction. The theoretical implications and future directions for this research are discussed.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				APR	2021	57	4					597	608		10.1037/dev0001156	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001156													WOS:000643550800011

Part 1 of this article presents a review of the literature on ability and developmental differentiation effects in children, revealing the need for studies that examine both effects simultaneously in this age group with appropriate statistical methods. Part 2 presents an empirical study in which nonlinear factor analytic models were applied to the standardization sample (N = 2,619 German elementary schoolchildren; 48% female; age: M = 8.8 years, SD = 1.2, range 6-12 years) of the THINK 1-4 intelligence test to investigate ability differentiation, developmental differentiation, and their interaction. The sample was nationally representative regarding age, gender, urbanization, and geographic location of residence but not regarding parents' education and migration background (overrepresentation of children with more educated parents, underrepresentation of children with migration background). The results showed no consistent evidence for the presence of differentiation effects or their interaction. Instead, different patterns were observed for figural, numerical, and verbal reasoning. Implications for the construction of intelligence tests, the assessment of intelligence in children, and for theories of cognitive development are discussed.

The Role of Negative Emotionality in the Development of Child Executive Function and Language Abilities From Toddlerhood to First Grade: An Adoption Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Understanding the role of negative emotionality in the development of executive functioning (EF) and language skills can help identify developmental windows that may provide promising opportunities for intervention. In addition, because EF and language skills are, in part, genetically influenced, intergenerational transmission patterns are important to consider. The prospective parent-offspring adoption design used in this study provides a unique opportunity to examine the intergenerational transmission of EF and language skills. Participants were 561 children adopted around the time of birth. Accounting for birth mother EF and language contributions, we examined the role of child negative emotionality in toddlerhood (age 9 to 27 months) and childhood (age 4.5 to 7 years) on child EF and language skills in first grade (age 7 years). There was continuity in EF from age 27 months to 7 years, and in language ability from age 27 months to 7 years, with no cross-lagged effects between child EF and language ability. Negative emotionality at age 9 months predicted lower EF and lower language abilities at age 7 years, and growth in negative emotionality from age 4.5 to 7 years predicted lower child EF at age 7 years. Overall, findings suggested that lower negative emotionality at age 9 months was associated with higher toddler and child EF and language skills and that preventing growth in negative emotionality from age 4.5 to 7 years may lead to improvements in child EF.

One reason for this might be a lack of automaticity in word-level lexical processes. To investigate this, we used a novel backward masking paradigm, in which a written word is either covered with a mask or not. Participants (N = 444 [after exclusions]; n(female) = 264, n(male) = 180) were average to struggling middle-school students from an urban area in Eastern Iowa that were all native speakers of English and were roughly equally from grades 6, 7, and 8 (average age: 13 years). Two-hundred-fifty-five students qualified for free or reduced-price lunch, a proxy for economic disadvantage. Participants completed different masked and unmasked task versions where they read a word and selected a response (e.g., a pictured referent). This was related to standardized measures of decoding, fluency, and reading comprehension. Decoding was uniquely predicted by knowledge (unmasked performance), whereas fluency was uniquely predicted by automaticity (masked performance). Automaticity was stable across two testing points. Thus, automaticity should be considered an individually reliable marker/reading trait that uniquely predicts some skills in average to struggling middle-school students.

Tomorrow Will Be Different: Children's Ability to Incorporate an Intervening Event When Thinking About the Future	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Future-oriented thought is ubiquitous in humans but challenging to study in children. Adults not only think about the future but can also represent a future state of the world that differs from the present. However, behavioral tasks to assess the development of future thought have not traditionally required children to do so as most can be solved based solely on representations of the present. To overcome this limitation, we modified an existing task such that children could not simply rely on a representation of the present to succeed (i.e., the correct answer for "right now" was different than the correct answer for "tomorrow"). A sample of 117 4- to 7-year-olds (64 girls and 53 boys) from Ottawa, Canada, and surrounding area, who were predominantly European Canadian (78.6% of sample) and had a family income of over $100,000 CAN (66.1% of sample) participated. Children remembered the information required to solve our task, and there were age-related changes in performance, but only 7-year-olds made an adaptive future-oriented decision significantly more often than chance. With the task modification removed (so the correct answer for the present and the future was the same), even 4-year-olds were above chance.

Participants ranged in age from 3 to 30 years, and were from middle-to-high income families in Yaounde, Cameroon. Biases were assessed by comparing attitudes toward Blacks with those toward Whites and Chinese. Implicit pro-Black/anti-otherrace (White and Chinese) biases were present at age 4, in contrast to anti-Black/pro-other-race biases, which were observed among 9- to 30-year-olds. In addition, explicit pro-Black/anti-other-race biases that were present at age 4 were no longer evident by age 7. These findings provide a detailed picture of age-related differences in racial biases in an understudied part of the world that can inform theories regarding the development of racial biases, as well as efforts to reduce such biases.

The present study extends previous research by examining (a) the growth of cooperation and self-control as well as the relations between them in middle childhood (third to sixth grade) and (b) the extent to which mothers' and fathers' parenting during early childhood (54 months and first grade) was associated with children's cooperation and self-control. The sample included 705 children (51% female, 86% White) and their mothers, fathers, and teachers in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD). Children, on average, exhibited increases in self-control but not cooperation from third to sixth grade though the increases were smaller for children who had higher self-control or cooperation at third grade. Children who exhibited higher self-control at third grade tended to exhibit higher cooperation at third grade; similar positive associations emerged for the changes in self-control and cooperation over time. In addition, if a child exhibited higher self-control at one time point relative to their typical average level, they tended to also exhibit higher cooperation at the same time point relative to their typical average level. However, these relative deviations within person were not associated over time. Lastly, maternal and paternal sensitive and stimulating parenting in early childhood was positively associated with children's cooperation and self-control in middle childhood. Overall, our findings shed light on the growth of and the relations between cooperation and self-control in middle childhood and highlight the role of maternal and paternal parenting in early childhood.

Specifically, preference for solitude, rather than social wariness, was expected to predict peer victimization and rejection, two aspects of peer difficulties. A total of 1,014 children from the Quebec Newborn Twin Study were assessed by teachers and peers at ages 6, 7, and 10 years. Multilevel analyses conducted across three levels, between family, within family, and within person, revealed that preference for solitude, rather than social wariness, increased the risk for peer difficulties in terms of both peer victimization and peer rejection. Specifically, preference for solitude was systematically associated with peer rejection starting at age 6 years and became progressively associated with peer victimization over time. This pattern was found both between and within families. In addition, the predictive association with peer rejection was found within genetically identical, monozygotic twin pairs, suggesting that this predictive association existed after taking into account genetic vulnerabilities. Social wariness was systematically unrelated to peer difficulties. These findings suggest that preference for solitude, rather than social wariness, is a risk factor for peer difficulties. They underscore the relevance of distinguishing these dimensions of social withdrawal and illustrate the usefulness of a family-informed design to document the processes underlying childhood social adjustment.

J	Hassan, R; Willoughby, T; Schmidt, LA				Hassan, Raha; Willoughby, Teena; Schmidt, Louis A.			Development of Shyness Across Adolescence: Reactivity, Regulation, or Both?	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The reactivity-regulation model suggests that the origins and maintenance of shyness results from relatively high levels of reactivity in combination with relatively low levels of regulation. Although this model has received some empirical support, there are still issues regarding directionality of the relations among variables and a dearth of studies examining the joint influence of reactivity and regulation on the prospective development of shyness. Using a longitudinal design, we first examined whether the relations among reactivity, regulation, and shyness were unidirectional or bidirectional in a sample of 1284 children (49.8% female, 84.1% White; mean parental education fell between associate degree/diploma and undergraduate degree) assessed annually across three waves from late childhood and early adolescence (M-age = 10.72 years) to adolescence (M-age = 12.42 years) and then examined whether reactivity and regulation interacted to influence the development of shyness over time. At Wave 1, shyness was related to higher levels of reactivity and lower levels of regulation at Wave 2, but neither reactivity nor regulation at Wave 1 predicted shyness at Wave 2. At Wave 2, shyness predicted greater reactivity at Wave 3, but shyness at Wave 3 was only predicted by lower levels of regulation at Wave 2. Contrary to the reactivity-regulation model of shyness, we found that relatively high levels of reactivity and low levels of regulation predicted a steep decrease in shyness over 3 years. These results are discussed in the context of the socioemotional difficulties experienced by shy individuals and demonstrate the importance of empirically evaluating long-standing models of personality development.

Adolescents' Ethnic-Racial Centrality Moderates Effect of School-Based Intervention on Ethnic-Racial Identity Exploration	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Research suggests that the process of adolescents exploring and developing clarity about their ethnicracial identity (ERI) is an important developmental competency. However, the extent to which individuals view their ERI as central to their overall self-concept (i.e., ERI centrality) informs the degree to which they choose to explore their ERI, potentially moderating ERI development. Utilizing data from a randomized controlled trial of a school-based intervention focused on increasing adolescents' ERI exploration, the current study examined whether the intervention effect was moderated by adolescents' baseline ERI centrality. Study participants (N = 218; M-age = 15.02; 49% female; 63% ethnic-racial minority; 28% free/reduced lunch) attended a high school in the southwest United States. Moderation analyses indicated that adolescents' ERI centrality at baseline (1-week pretest) significantly moderated the intervention's effect on Time-2 ERI exploration (12-week posttest). Further analyses of simple slopes revealed that the intervention produced significant increases in Time-2 ERI exploration (relative to attention control) for adolescents with average and higher (+1 SD) levels of ERI centrality at baseline, but not for those with lower levels of ERI centrality at baseline (-1 SD), which suggests ERI centrality may have encouraged participant engagement with the intervention. Sensitivity analyses accounting for baseline to posttest changes in ERI exploration and examining long-term effects of the intervention on exploration provided additional support for the specificity of this moderated intervention effect to the 12-week posttest. Our findings are consistent with notions from social identity theory as well as previous research that suggests that ERI centrality encourages ERI exploration among adolescents.

Childhood maltreatment is related to maladaptation in cognitive and affective domains (e.g., executive functioning, emotion regulation) implicated in the development of decision-making capacities. This study investigates childhood maltreatment and subsequent childhood attention problems as developmental antecedents of decision making performance in emerging adulthood. At Wave 1, equal numbers of maltreated and non-maltreated children (M-age = 11.28, SD = .97; 51.5% female; mean family income: $22,530/year) were recruited to take part in a research summer camp. The current study includes a subset of participants (n = 379) from Wave 1 who completed the Cambridge Gambling Task (CGT) at Wave 2 (M-age = 19.68, SD = 1.12; 77.3% Black/African American, 11.1% White, 7.7% Hispanic, 4.0% Other race). The CGT measured decision-making performance by assessing betting behavior across trials that differed in probability of winning. ANOVA results showed that emerging adults who experienced maltreatment in childhood placed higher bets and less sensitively adjusted bets across trials varying in level of risk. Longitudinal structural equation modeling results indicated significant relationships between number of maltreatment subtypes and greater childhood inattention, controlling for IQ. In turn, greater attention problems in childhood predicted worse risk adjustment, or ability to modify betting based on the probability of winning on CGT trials. This mediated path shows one process by which maltreatment negatively affects decision making and risk taking processes in emerging adulthood.

J	Conger, KJ; Neppl, TK; Scaramella, L				Conger, Katherine Jewsbury; Neppl, Tricia K.; Scaramella, Laura			Special Section on Personality Development: Testing Environmental and Genetic Associations Across Generations	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This special section focuses on the life-course development of positive and negative personality traits and their consequences. Specifically, we pose four research questions inspired by the special section in Developmental Psychology on Conscientiousness (Reiss, Eccles, & Nielsen, 2014). The current set of articles extends the examination of the positive effects of Conscientiousness on individual well-being by also considering the potentially disruptive effects of specific negative personality traits (alienation and low sense of well-being). Our four questions are as follows. Question 1: what are the correlates of Conscientiousness and negative personality traits in terms of family processes? Question 2: to what degree do Conscientiousness and negative traits operate in a transactional process with the social and economic environment to amplify or suppress these characteristics? Question 3: how do individual personality characteristics affect specific behaviors and interactions within lived-environments to impact later well-being and life outcomes? Question 4: is there evidence that particular genetic characteristics affect connections between personality and its antecedents or consequences? One unique aspect of the present special section is that we address these issues across time utilizing prospective, longitudinal data provided by over 2,400 individual family members participating in the Family Transitions Project (FTP). This introductory article outlines the goals of the special section, and presents the background and development of the FTP, a longitudinal, multigenerational research project which provides the data for the four empirical articles in the special section.

Dynamic Associations Among Socioeconomic Status (SES), Parenting Investments, and Conscientiousness Across Time and Generations	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Building on recommendations from several of the articles in the special section on conscientiousness in the June 2014 issue of Developmental Psychology, the present study tested predictions from the interactionist model (IM) of socioeconomic influences on individual development. In an approach consistent with the idea of cumulative advantage, the model proposed that adolescent and child conscientiousness would be fostered by higher family socioeconomic status (SES) and the parenting and material investments that SES promotes. The IM also predicted a transactional process in which adolescent conscientiousness would promote future socioeconomic success which, in turn, would foster greater adult conscientiousness. Analyses with a cohort of 347 adolescents followed for over 20 years were largely consistent with these predictions, although the findings suggested some modifications to the IM, including the addition of a stronger direct role for family processes in eventual social and economic outcomes. Moreover, additional analyses with 282 of the children of these cohort members demonstrated that this same process was partially replicated in the next generation of children. The findings suggest reciprocal or transactional influences that promote conscientiousness and accumulating personal, economic, and social advantages over time and generations.

The model tested proposed that lower family socioeconomic status would lead to fewer parenting, and material investments in the next generation adolescent, which in turn would be associated with higher levels of adolescent negative personality traits. The IM also predicted a transactional process in which adolescent negative personality attributes would then deter future socioeconomic success during adulthood which. in turn, would hinder adult development in terms of greater feelings of alienation and diminished well-being. Analyses with a cohort of 347 adolescents followed for over 20 years produced findings consistent with these predictions. Moreover, additional analyses with 282 of the third generation children of these cohort members demonstrated that this same process was being replicated in the third generation. The findings suggest reciprocal or transactional influences that promote the development of negative personality attributes and accumulating personal, economic and social advantages over time and generations.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				FEB	2021	57	2					164	179		10.1037/dev0000426	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000426								33539125					WOS:000618090100003

Genetic Influences on the Interactionist Model of Socioeconomic Development: Incorporating Polygenic Scores for Educational Attainment Into Developmental Research Using the Family Transitions Project (FTP)	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Genetic and environmental factois account for variability in a range of developmental outcomes, including socioeconomic status (SES). The challenge is to find ways to incorporate genetic information based on studies using biologically related family members (i.e., studies not involving twins). To address this issue. we computed polygenic scores associated with educational attainment (Lee et al., 2018) for the Family Transitions Project (e.g., R. D. Conger & Conger, 2002) and incorporauxi them into the model tested by R. D. Conger, Martin. and Masarik, (2021). Polygenic scores correlated with observed educational anainment for all relevant members of the Family Transitions Project Moteover, polygenic sows were correlated with many of the other oonstructs in the R. D. Conger et al. (2021) model, pointing to the relevance of genetic factors for process models of SES attainment. At the same time, the primary pathways described by R. D. Conger et al. (2021) remained viable when polygenic scores were included in the analyses, suggesting that the environmental pathways predicted by the interactionist model (e.g.. R. D. Comer, Conger, & Martin, 2010) are still tenable. The current study thereby illustrates how genetic information can be included in tests of developmmtal models to clarify SES attainment across generations.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				FEB	2021	57	2					180	190		10.1037/dev0000901	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000901								33539126					WOS:000618090100004
J	Stallings, MC; Neppl, T				Stallings, Michael C.; Neppl, Tricia			An Examination of Genetic and Environmental Factors Related to Negative Personality Traits, Educational Attainment, and Economic Success	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Personality variables are associated with educational attainment and socioeconomic outcomes. In this study we incorporated a polygenic score derived from the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) of educational attainment to date (Lee et al., 2018) into the Interactionist Model of R. D. Conger, Martin, and Masarik (2021) that describes the influence of socioeconomic factors on individual development. The inclusion of a polygenic score predictive of educational attainment (PS-Edu) into this model, and the use of the multigeneration, longitudinal Family Transitions Project (FTP) provide a unique opportunity to investigate genetic and environmental influences on the development of negative personality traits and educational and economic outcomes. The FTP is a three-generation sample. This study utilized data from the first generation (G1; mean age 40 at initiation of the FTP) and second generation (G2; assessed at mean ages 18 and 30). Participants are approximately 50% female, 99% of European ancestry, primarily from lower to middle class SES. PS-Edu was significantly correlated with educational attainment in both generations of the FTP, accounting for 4.1 to 6.7% of the variance. Findings confirm that PS-Edu is a complex genetic index that is correlated with all of the socioeconomic constructs in the model. Results suggest potential gene-environment correlation or common genetic influences underlie associations among parenting investments, negative personality traits, and educational attainment. Genetic variance captured by PS-Edu was mediated substantially through GI parental investments. Although study limitations warrant cautious interpretation, we demonstrate the promise of including polygenic scores in developmental models to better understand genetic and environmental influences on human development.

The present study examined whether two indicators of deprivation, sociodemographic burden and observed parental insensitivity, were associated with child diurnal cortisol rhythms among a diverse community sample of 250 infants ages 5 to 22 months (M = 12.68 months, 47.2% male). The sample was diverse in terms of socioeconomic status as assessed by household income (M = $59,163, SD = $57,775, range = $0-230,000) and infant race/ethnicity (41.6% African American, 19.2% White, 17.2% multiracial, 14.0% Hispanic/Latin, 2.8% Caribbean, 2.8% other, 1.2% American Indian/Alaska Native, and 1.2% Asian). Sociodemographic burden indicators were assessed through questionnaires completed by the parent. Parental sensitivity was assessed through observations of parents' interactions with their infants during a play interaction task. Cortisol was assayed from infant saliva samples collected at waking and bedtime across 3 days. Structural equation modeling revealed that higher sociodemographic burden, but not parental insensitivity, was associated with blunted diurnal cortisol slopes. Neither sociodemographic burden nor parental insensitivity were associated with the cortisol awakening response. These findings suggest that sociodemographic burden may be an important early predictor of diurnal cortisol slope dysregulation. highlighting the importance of interventions providing support to individuals who experience sociodemographic burden and promoting reduction of these early stressors.

J	Cheung, P; Ansari, D				Cheung, Pierina; Ansari, Daniel			Cracking the Code of Place Value: The Relationship Between <i>Place</i> and <i>Value</i> Takes Years to Master	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Place value, which underlies the meanings of multidigits, encompasses the principle of position and base-10 rules. To understand 65, one needs to know that the digits 6 and 5 occupy different positions and thus represent ordered values of different magnitudes (i.e., the principle of position) and that the value of each position is determined by base-10 rules (i.e., the rightmost position is 10(0), followed by 10(1), 10(2), etc.). Without the principle of position, children cannot construct meanings for multidigits. Previous studies have shown that children do not know the exact value of digit positions until the early elementary school years, but less is known about the acquisition of positional knowledge for multidigits. To study when and how children construct a relationship between position and value, we explore when children begin to know that the leftmost digit represents the largest value and whether such knowledge relates to learning number names. Children ages 4 to 7 years, from primarily Caucasian, middle-class families were asked to compare different pairs of multidigits. Some comparisons (e.g., 12 vs. 21) required knowledge of positional property, and some did not (e.g., 35 vs. 36). We found that as a group, 6-year-old children could recruit positional knowledge to compare multidigits. We also found that children who knew the number names of both multidigits in a comparison pair were above chance on multidigit comparison. Our results shed light on the developmental steps toward aapiring place-value notation and highlight a role of learning number names for learning positional property of the place-value notation.

The Trajectory of Counterfactual Simulation in Development	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Young children often struggle to answer the question "what would have happened?" particularly in cases where the adult-like "correct" answer has the same outcome as the event that actually occurred. Previous work has assumed that children fail because they cannot engage in accurate counterfactual simulations. Children have trouble considering what to change and what to keep fixed when comparing counterfactual alternatives to reality. However, most developmental studies on counterfactual reasoning have relied on binary yes/no responses to counterfactual questions about complex narratives and so have only been able to document when these failures occur but not why and how. Here, we investigate counterfactual reasoning in a domain in which specific counterfactual possibilities are very concrete: simple collision interactions. In Experiment 1, we show that 5- to 10-year-old children (recruited from schools and museums in Connecticut) succeed in making predictions but struggle to answer binary counterfactual questions. In Experiment 2, we use a multiple-choice method to allow children to select a specific counterfactual possibility. We find evidence that 4- to 6-year-old children (recruited online from across the United States) do conduct counterfactual simulations, but the counterfactual possibilities younger children consider differ from adult-like reasoning in systematic ways. Experiment 3 provides further evidence that young children engage in simulation rather than using a simpler visual matching strategy. Together, these experiments show that the developmental changes in counterfactual reasoning are not simply a matter of whether children engage in counterfactual simulation but also how they do so.

J	Lütke, N; Lange-Küttner, C				Luetke, Nikolay; Lange-Kuettner, Christiane			The Magical Number Four in Children's Mental Rotation of Cube Aggregates	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We investigated mental rotation in children by systematically varying the adult cube aggregate's set size, rotation angle, and picture/depth plane rotations in a new test. Eighty 4- to 11-year-old mainly middle-class children (British Indian and British African majority and white minority; 40 girls and 40 boys) were assessed using the new matching-to-sample Colored Mental Rotation Test (CMRT) and, for comparison, the Raven Colored Progressive Matrices Test (RCPM). A high Cronbach's alpha of .94 and the Rasch model demonstrated item homogeneity of the CMRT. As expected. there were main effects of age showing increases in accuracy and of sex as boys outperformed girls. A main effect of set size showed that from age four until age 10 as four-cube aggregates proved to be the most economical three-dimensional (3D) object for mental rotation. Several higher-order interactions all involved fourcube aggregates, for example, 3D cube element protrusions had the largest effect in the four-cubeaggregate. We thus suggest that the magical number four (Cowan, 2(5)1) as an attentional limit may also be valid in mental rotation and linked to the 'Good Gestalt' design of the four-cube aggregate. The cross-validation of CMRT with the RCPM showed high correlations increasing from .69 in 4- to 5-year-olds to .77 in 10- to 11-year-olds. Interestingly, 4- to 5-year-olds girls scored higher in the Raven test of nonverbal reasoning than in the CRMT scores with 3D cube aggregates demonstrating the particular complexity of 3D pictorial space.

J	Kray, J; Kreis, BK; Lorenz, C				Kray, Jutta; Kreis, Barbara K.; Lorenz, Corinna			Age Differences in Decision Making Under Known Risk: The Role of Working Memory and Impulsivity	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examined whether age differences in risky decision making are dependent on known probability and value of outcomes (i.e., the expected value [EV]), the valence of anticipated outcomes (gains or losses). and individual differences in working memory and impulsivity. We used a task that varied risk independently from EV so that taking risks could be advantageous or disadvantageous. Results indicated differential developmental courses for the sensitivity to EV and outcome valence from early to late adolescence. An increase in risk-advantageous but a decrease in risk-disadvantageous behavior was obtained between early-to-mid and late adolescence. All adolescents showed higher risky behavior when losses rather than gains were expected. Age differences in the sensitivity to EV were fully mediated by individual differences in working memory but not by self-reported impulsivity, suggesting that decision making under known risk is strongly limited by the maturation of cognitive control processes.

Parental symptoms can put adolescents at risk for developing psychopathological symptoms. This study examined the reciprocal, longitudinal associations between parental and adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms between and within families, using random-intercept cross-lagged panel models (RI-CLPMs). Participants were 497 Dutch adolescents (43.1% girls; M-age T-1 = 13.0 years; mostly medium to high socioeconomic backgrounds) and their parents from the general population. Across six years, adolescents and their mothers and fathers reported annually on their internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Between families, maternal, but not paternal internalizing and externalizing symptoms were consistently associated with adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms, while within families, only increases in adolescent internalizing symptoms predicted subsequent increases in maternal internalizing symptoms. These findings suggest that associations within families differ from associations between families, and that within-family processes in the transmission of internalizing symptoms are particularly driven by adolescent-to-mother effects.

The present study aimed to identify and compare mothers' conceptualizations of parenting control across four cultures to reveal a more nuanced understanding regarding the meaning and practices of control: European American, Chinese immigrant. Korean immigrant, and Turkish. Using a semistructured open-ended interview, 100 European American, 102 U.S. Chinese immigrant, 103 U.S. Korean immigrant, and 109 Turkish mothers of preschool-aged children reported the ratings of importance, specific reasons, and strategies for exerting control over their children in daily life. Results revealed both shared and unique conceptualizations of maternal control across four cultures. Specifically, all mothers reported that it is important to express maternal control over their children in order to set behavioral norms/standards, maintain child safety, support social relations and respect for others, provide guidance, and guide moral development. Moreover, mothers discussed utilizing nonphysical punishment, setting and maintaining rules, reasoning/negotiating. consistency, physical punishment and verbal control, showing parents' serious/stern attitude, correction. and psychological control forms of control. However, the levels at which mothers emphasize the different reasons and strategies varied across cultures, reflecting culturally emphasized values. The findings of the present study further enrich our understanding of the complexities of maternal control across cultures.

Mexican-Origin Youth's Ethnic-Racial Identity Development: The Role of Siblings	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Ethnic-racial identity (ERI) formation is an important developmental task. Although families are a primary context for ERI socialization, little is known about siblings' role. Accordingly. we applied the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model to longitudinal data from 2 siblings to examine the links between siblings' ERI exploration, resolution, and affirmation. Participants were Mexican-origin mothers, fathers, and 2 siblings (older siblings M-age = 20.65 years; younger siblings M-age = 17.72 years) from 246 families in Arizona who were interviewed on 2 occasions across 2 years. Siblings' ERI exploration in late adolescence positively predicted young adult ERI, accounting for mothers' and fathers' ERIs. For resolution, the sibling (i.e., partner) effect was moderated by sibling gender constellation, such that the sibling effect emerged only for same-sex dyads. For affirmation, the sibling effect emerged for older but not younger siblings. These findings highlight the need to understand siblings' role in ERI and to expand research on family socialization of ERI beyond parents.

To obtain insight in real-time processes that may underly the development of friendship closeness in middle adolescence, this preregistered experience sampling study [ESM] investigated the effects of social media use on friendship closeness. The study was conducted among 387 adolescents (54% girls; M-age = 14.11 years: 96% Dutch) from different educational tracks (44% lower prevocational secondary education, 31% intermediate general secondary education, 26% academic preparatory education). Adolescents reported six times per day for 3 weeks on their Instagram, WhatsApp, and Snapchat use in the previous hour and their momentary experiences of friendship closeness (126 assessments; 34,930 observations). Multilevel analyses revealed positive between-person associations of friendship closeness with general WhatsApp use and Instagram use with close friends. In contrast, at the within-person level, we found small negative overall associations of general WhatsApp use and Instagram use (with and without close friends) with friendship closeness. However, there was large heterogeneity in the persons-pecific effect sizes of the within-person associations of social media use with friendship closeness. For example, person-specific effect sizes of the association of Instagram use with close friends with friendship closeness ranged from beta = -.745 to beta = .697. These results underline the importance of acknowledging person-specific effects in developmental and media effect theories.

J	Von Holzen, K; Bergmann, C				Von Holzen, Katie; Bergmann, Christina			The Development of Infants' Responses to Mispronunciations: A Meta-Analysis	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												As they develop into mature speakers of their native language, infants must not only learn words but also the sounds that make up those words. To do so, they must strike a balance between accepting speaker-dependent variation (e.g., mood, voice, accent) but appropriately rejecting variation when it (potentially) changes a word's meaning (e.g., cat vs. hat). This meta-analysis focuses on studies investigating infants' ability to detect mispronunciations in familiar words, or mispronunciation sensitivity. Our goal was to evaluate the development of infants' phonological representations for familiar words as well as explore the role of experimental manipulations related to theoretical questions and of analysis choices. The results show that although infants are sensitive to mispronunciations, they still accept these altered forms as labels for target objects. Interestingly, this ability is not modulated by age or vocabulary size, suggesting that a mature understanding of native language phonology may be present in infants from an early age, possibly before the vocabulary explosion. These results support several theoretical assumptions made in the literature, such as sensitivity to mispronunciation size and position of the mispronunciation. We also shed light on the impact of data analysis choices that may lead to different conclusions regarding the development of infants' mispronunciation sensitivity. Our article concludes with recommendations for improved practice in testing infants' word and sentence processing online.

Beyond Perceptual Narrowing: Monolingual and Bilingual Infants Discriminate Hindi Contrasts When Learning Words in the Second Year of Life	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												A significant body of literature has demonstrated that infants demonstrate a decline in sensitivity to nonnative sound contrasts by their first birthday, a transition often thought to be adaptive for later word learning. The present study investigated infants' sensitivity to these contrasts in a habituation-based discrimination and word learning task (total N = 168, 78 males and 90 females). All infants were native to Singapore and were of Chinese origin. Family socioeconomic status (SES) was measured by parental education. The mean number of years of parental education was 4.02 years after high school. Using a habituation-based discrimination paradigm, monolingual, and bilingual infants' sensitivity to the Hindi dental/retroflex voiceless stop was investigated at 14 months (Experiment 1). Neither group discriminated the contrast. Using the Switch paradigm, we assessed sensitivity to the same contrast in a word learning task. Monolingual and bilingual infants were tested at 14- and 19 months (Experiment 2a) and subsequently, an older group of bilingual infants was tested at 24 months (Experiment 2b). Results demonstrated an overall sensitivity to the Hindi contrast in Experiment 2a. Bilingual infants tested in Experiment 2b were not sensitive to the Hindi contrast. Findings are discussed with reference to discontinuities in the growth of a phonological lexicon as well as possible mechanisms elicit nonnative sensitivity in word learning.

Scott			Developmental Change in the Nature of Attention Allocation in a Dual Task	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Younger children have more difficulty in sharing attention between two concurrent tasks than do older participants, but in addition to this developmental change, we documented changes in the nature of attention sharing. We studied children 6-8 and 10-14 years old and college students (in all, 104 women and 76 men; 3% Hispanic, 3% Black or African American, 3% Asian, 7% multiracial, and 84% White). On each dual-task trial, the participant received an array of colored squares to be retained for a subsequent probe recognition test and then an easy or more difficult signal requiring a quick response (a speeded task, clicking a key on the same side of the screen as the signal or the opposite side). Finally, each trial ended with the presentation of the array item recognition probe and the participant's response to it. In our youngest age group (6-8 years), array memory was often displaced by the speeded task performed under load, especially when it was the opposite-side task, but speeded-task accuracies were unaffected by the presence of an array memory load. In contrast, in older participants (10-14 years and college students), the memory load was maintained better, with some cost to the speeded task. With maturity, participants were better able to adopt a proactive stance in which not only present processing demands but also upcoming demands were taken into account, allowing them to balance the demands of the two tasks.

Results show that parents' physical discipline in Kindergarten was associated with lower literacy levels in 8th grade and slower growth in literacy development from K-8. Additionally, parents' physical discipline during Kindergarten predicted more externalizing symptoms 1 year later, which in turn predicted lower literacy skills in eighth grade (partial mediation detected) and lower growth rates in literacy skills over time (complete mediation detected). Overall, parents' physical discipline administered during their child's kindergarten year may have cascading detrimental impacts on child literacy development through externalizing problem behaviors.

Paige			Adolescent Big Five Personality and Pubertal Development: Pubertal Hormone Concentrations and Self-Reported Pubertal Status	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												In early adolescence, levels of conscientiousness and agreeableness have been found to temporarily decrease, with levels of neuroticism increasing, indicating a dip in personality maturation. It is unknown whether these changes are related to the process of puberty, a major developmental milestone with numerous changes for children. Here, we first replicated the dip in personality maturity in early adolescence (N = 2640, age range 8-18, 51% girls, 65% non-Hispanic white, 21% Hispanic/Latino, 10% African American, 9% other, roughly 33% of families received means-tested public assistance) and tested associations between the Big Five personality dimensions and pubertal development and timing across late childhood and adolescence (n = 1793). Pubertal development was measured using both hormonal assays (DHEA, testosterone, and progesterone) and self-reports of secondary sex characteristics. Of hormonal measures, only higher DHEA concentrations were associated with lower conscientiousness and openness. Nonparametric moderation analyses using LOSEM indicated Complex Age x Sex interactions involving all three hormones. Self-reported pubertal development was associated with lower extraversion, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and openness. More advanced pubertal timing was also related to lower levels of extraversion, conscientiousness, and agreeableness. All associations were small. As some evidence was found for small associations between pubertal development and lower levels of conscientiousness and agreeableness, a dip in personality maturation in these personality traits may be partly due to pubertal development in early adolescence. Overall, results did not indicate that pubertal development was the primary explanation of the maturity dip in adolescent personality. Many small influences likely accumulate to explain the dip in personality maturity in early adolescence.

The Role of Psychological Factors and Institutional Channels in Predicting the Attainment of Postsecondary Goals	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Developmental systems theory and life span development describe the role of individual-context interactions in individual development but have not directly addressed how individuals pursue achievement goals in institutional contexts. We developed a theory informed by these perspectives that explains how institutional contexts affect emerging adults' success in transitioning to and progressing through college. We theorize that institutional contexts increase individuals' probability of attaining specific goals when they provide stronger channels that offer more versus fewer structural supports for these goals. Moreover, we theorize, these institutional channels influence which individual differences, including belonging certainty, growth mindset of intelligence, and grit, will be useful in goal pursuit, above and beyond individuals' academic preparation and demographic factors. We examined postsecondary goal pursuit over a 6-year period among 1,850 students who attended one of four district high schools in Pennsylvania or Massachusetts. On average, they began the study at 17.91 years of age; 48% were male, 43% belonged to a historically marginalized ethnicity, and 56% had free or reduced lunch status. We found that channel strength and psychological factors interacted in ways predicted by our theory. Higher belonging certainty and growth mindset in Grade 12, which encourage a focus on process and progress, predicted better outcomes in weaker postsecondary channels, especially college enrollment and on-track progress. Higher grit, which encourages a commitment to goal attainment, predicted better outcomes in stronger postsecondary channels, especially on-time graduation. The study locates the importance of psychological factors in predicting goal attainment in different-strength institutional channels during emerging adulthood.					; Yeager, David/AAC-5302-2019	Goyer, Parker/0000-0001-6403-3643; Yeager, David/0000-0002-8522-9503													0012-1649	1939-0599				JAN	2021	57	1					73	86		10.1037/dev0001142	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001142								33271033					WOS:000604915800006

A sample of Black, White, and Multiracial children (N = 100; M-age = 10.18 years old) were interviewed about their racial identities in 2014 and again in 2016. During these 2 years, BLM surged with the National March on Washington, widespread news coverage of multiple cases of police brutality, and a highly racialized presidential election. The current analysis examines longitudinal change in children's racial identity narratives across these two time points with attention to the role of BLM. Qualitative interview analyses show that (a) the importance of racial identity increased among Black and Multiracial (but not White) children, and (b) the content of children's race narratives shifted to include BLM-related themes and more discussions of race as interpersonal and structural (not just individual). We discuss age-related changes and how to conceptualize maturation during significant sociopolitical moments, like the current one, in relation to racial identity development.					rogers, onnie/AAR-2683-2021	Rosario, Josiah/0000-0002-2846-788X; Padilla, Dayanara/0000-0002-6975-4498; Foo, Christina/0000-0001-6241-176X													0012-1649	1939-0599				JAN	2021	57	1					87	101		10.1037/dev0001130	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001130								33271030					WOS:000604915800007

The aim of the current research was to replicate and extend this finding by investigating whether a different child-friendly manipulation exposing children to positive Black exemplars and negative White exemplars could decrease implicit pro-White/anti-Black racial bias in children aged 5 to 12 years, both immediately following the intervention and 1 hr later. In addition, a second aim of this research was to examine whether child-friendly positive exemplar exposure would similarly reduce adults' implicit racial bias. In a sample of White and Asian Canadians (N = 478; 182 male, 296 female), recruited from a community science center (children) and a public university in Vancouver (adults), 9- to 12-year-old children's racial bias was reduced up to 1 hr after this new intervention, while the effectiveness of the intervention on 5-to 8-year-old children's bias was less clear. Interestingly, this intervention did not reduce adult levels of bias. The results of a follow-up study (N = 96; 23 male, 72 female, 1 nonbinary) indicate that exposure to child exemplars can reduce bias in adults, but only when additional instructions are provided to internalize the presented association. Thus, the current study provides evidence that depicting counterstereotypical exemplars can reduce implicit racial bias in children for up to 1 hr after exemplar exposure, but there may be important developmental differences in the conditions required to change this bias.

"Just as Good": Learning Gender Stereotypes From Attempts to Counteract Them	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												How do children learn gender stereotypes? Although people commonly use statements like "Girls are as good as boys at math" to express gender equality, such subject-complement statements subtly perpetuate the stereotype that boys are naturally more skilled. The syntax of such statements frames the item in the complement position (here, boys) as the standard for comparison or reference point. Thus, when the statement concerns ability, listeners infer that this item is naturally more skilled than the item in the subject position (here, girls). In 2 experiments, we ask whether subject-complement statements could not only reinforce preexisting gender stereotypes, but also teach them. The participants were 288 adults (51% women, 49% men) and 337 children ages 7 to 11 (50% girls, 50% boys; of the 62% who reported race, 44% self-declared as White; from primarily middle-class to upper middle-class families). Participants were provided with subject-complement statements about either novel abilities (e.g., "Girls are as good as boys at trewting") or nonstereotyped activities (e.g., "Boys are as good as girls at snapping"). Both adults and children inferred that the gender in the complement position was naturally more skilled than the gender in the subject position. Using subject-complement statements to express gender equality (e.g., "Girls are as good as boys at math") could thus backfire and teach children that boys have more natural ability.

How older people accomplish this is, however, an open question. We propose that this age effect is the result of differential use of emotion regulation strategies, especially when affective states call for them. We assessed a wide range of emotion regulation strategies over 2 months of daily life (60 consecutive days, N = 9,089 observations). Sample was composed of N = 153 participants (52% female; 62.09% White, 19.61% Black or African American, 9.80% Asian,1.96% Hispanic or Latino, 1.31% Native American, and 5.23% were missing cases) ranging in age from 18 to 84 years, (M = 45, SD = 20.02). We compare three age groups: young (n = 50, college students, median age of 21 years), middle aged (n = 52, university graduates, median age 44 years), and older (n = 51, university graduates, median age of 68 years). Using mixed model analyses of mood regulation strategy use, we find a main effect for age, negative affect (NA), and an interaction between NA and age, meaning that, in general, older participants' use of emotion regulation strategy was higher with negative affect than for younger participants. In summary, older participants used a wider variety of emotion regulation strategies, and they used them most when their affective states called for them, compared to younger participants. Results are interpreted along the lines of an "older but wiser" perspective on emotional well-being and aging.

Novice readers, therefore, struggle with the complex orthography of Arabic as well as the mastering of MSA. Here, we tested whether structured activities in MSA would advance kindergarteners' MSA aptitude by the end of the school year. We examined two issues: (a) whether reciting nursery rhymes in MSA would be more effective in promoting language and preliteracy skills in kindergarteners compared to listening to the same texts, and (b) whether there are additional advantages for using texts directly referring to the alphabet. Thus, 136 kindergarteners (M-age = 5:6; 61 girls), all native speakers of Arabic and with middle-low socioeconomic background, were assigned to a 10-session (2 months) program in 1 of 4 intervention conditions wherein nursery rhymes related/not related to the alphabet, were either repeatedly recited or listened to. The achievements of children in the intervention conditions were compared to those of peers that were given nonlinguistic activity of similar length (control). The four intervention groups improved their performance at the postintervention assessment in all tests of MSA aptitude and outperformed the control group in receptive and expressive vocabulary and listening comprehension. Also, the reciting groups were better than the control and listening groups in tests assessing vocabulary and morpho-syntactic sensitivity. Our results highlight the contribution of structured interventions based on rhyme repetition to MSA proficiency of kindergarteners. Moreover, the results suggest that reciting may be superior to listening in advancing language proficiency in preschoolers.

Giving a Larger Amount or a Larger Proportion: Stimulus Format Impacts Children's Social Evaluations	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Young children show remarkably sophisticated abilities to evaluate others. Yet their abilities to engage in proportional moral evaluation undergoes protracted development. Namely, young children evaluate someone who shares absolutely more as being "nicer" than someone who shares proportionally more (e.g., sharing 3-out-of-6 is nicer than sharing 2-out-of-3, because 3 > 2, even though 3/6 < 2/3), whereas adults think the opposite. We investigate the hypothesis that this prior work underestimates children's proportional social reasoning by relying on discrete and spatially separated quantities (e.g., individual stickers), which can hinder proportional reasoning even outside social contexts. In three experiments we examine whether 4- and 5-year-old children's social evaluations are impacted by the discreteness and spatial separation of the resource and compare their behavior to adults (18 to 63 years; across all samples: 38% girls/women, 62% boys/men; no other demographic data was collected). We find that children are sensitive to these features: when the resource was divided into discrete units (Experiment 1) or spatially separated (Experiment 2) children were more likely to use absolute amount, as opposed to proportion, relative to when the resources were not divided and remained spatially connected. However, adults were highly sensitive to proportion regardless of the display's perceptual features (Experiment 3), and children's use of proportion remained below adult-levels. These results suggest that perceptual features influence children's use of absolute versus proportional information in their social evaluations, which has theoretical and methodological implications for understanding children's conceptions of fairness.

J	Rizzo, MT; Killen, M				Rizzo, Michael T.; Killen, Melanie			Children's Evaluations of Individually and Structurally Based Inequalities: The Role of Status	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Social inequalities limit important opportunities and resources for members of marginalized and disadvantaged groups. Understanding the origins of how children construct their understanding of social inequalities in the context of their everyday peer interactions has the potential to yield novel insights into when-and how-individuals respond to different types of social inequalities. The present study examined whether children (N = 176; 3- to 8-years-old; 52% female, 48% male; 70% European American, 16% African American, 10% Latinx, and 4% Asian American; middle-income backgrounds) differentiate between structurally based inequalities (e.g., based on gender) and individually based inequalities (e.g., based on merit). Children were randomly assigned to a group that received more (advantaged) or fewer (disadvantaged) resources than another group due to either their groups' meritorious performance on a task or the gender biases of the peer in charge of allocating resources. Overall, children evaluated structurally based inequalities to be more unfair and worthy of rectification than individually based inequalities, and disadvantaged children were more likely to view inequalities to be wrong and act to rectify them compared to advantaged children. With age, advantaged children became more likely to rectify the inequalities and judge perpetuating allocations to be unfair. Yet, the majority of children allocated equally in response to both types of inequality. The findings generated novel evidence regarding how children evaluate and respond to individually and structurally based inequalities, and how children's own status within the inequality informs these responses.

Measurement Models for Studying Child Executive Functioning: Questioning the Status Quo	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Despite widespread interest in the construct of executive functioning (EF), we currently lack definitive evidence regarding the best measurement model for representing the construct in substantive analyses. The most common practice is to represent EF ability as a reflective latent variable, with child performance on individual EF tasks as observed indicators. The current article critically evaluates the dominant use of reflective latent variable models in the child EF literature and compares them to composite models, a reasonable alternative. We review the literature suggesting that reflective latent variable models may not be the most appropriate representation of the construct of EF. Using preschool (M-age = 48.3 months) and first grade (M-age = 83.5 months) data from the Family Life Project (N = 920), we also investigate the implications of measurement model specification for the interpretation of study findings. Children in this sample varied in terms of sex (49% male), race (43% black) and socioeconomic status (76% low-income). Our findings show that the conclusions we draw from 2 substantive analyses differ depending on whether EF is modeled as a reflective latent variable versus a composite variable. We describe the implications of these findings for research on child EF and offer practical recommendations for producers and consumers of developmental research.

The Association of Parent-Reported Executive Functioning, Reading, and Math Is Explained by Nature, Not Nurture	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												According to the hybrid model (van Bergen, van der Leij, & de Jong, 2014), the significant association among executive functioning (EF), reading, and math may be partially explained by parent-reported EF's role as a common risk and/or protective factor in reading and math (dis)abilities. The current study used a sample of 434 twin pairs (M-age = 12.12) from Florida to conduct genetically sensitive modeling on children's parent-reported EF, reading, and math skills to determine the common and unique etiological influences among the three domains. EF was measured through parent report and reading and math were measured with standardized test scores drawn from Florida's Progress Monitoring and Reporting Network as well as standardized parent-administered assessments collected by mail. Our trivariate Cholesky modeling showed that no matter which parent-reported EF component was modeled, the overlap of parent-reported EF with reading and math was explained by common genetic influences. Supplemental analysis suggested that this might in part be due to general parent report of problem behaviors. Additionally, significant environmental influences, with higher shared environmental overlap than previous work, were also found for reading and math. Findings indicate that poor parent-reported EF is a common cognitive risk factor for reading and math disabilities, which is driven by a shared genetic basis among all three domains.

Despite its importance, the understanding of the processes underlying mean interference effects across development is still limited. When measured through conflict tasks, mean interference effects reflect both the strength of the initial automatic incorrect response activation by the irrelevant stimulus dimension and the capacity to subsequently suppress this tendency and/or activate the correct response. To investigate the development of interference control, we focused on the time course of these activation and/or suppression processes studied in 360 children distributed in 10 age groups (from 5 to 14 years of age) and 36 adults. Each participant performed the 3 mostly used conflict tasks (Simon, flanker, and Stroop) designed to be sensitive across the whole age range. Performances were analyzed using distribution analyses of accuracy and response times. Conditional accuracy functions highlighted conflict-dependent developmental changes in the time course of the initial incorrect response capture and later controlled correct response activation: These results revealed a mature pattern for Simon from 5 years onward (the easiest task as assessed by fastest reaction time and highest accuracy), late maturation in Stroop (the most difficult task), intermediate in flanker. In contrast, despite the increased speed of responses across the age range, the shape of correct response distributions did not change with age, leaving open the maturation of suppression processes. Results are discussed with respect to the interest of the methodology used and debates on the interpretation of the dynamics at hand.

Models on youth character, noncognitive skills, and social-emotional learning suggest that self-management skills like work habits are critical for individuals' subsequent academic success. Using data from 1,124 children in the NICHD Study of Early Childcare and Youth Development (49% female; 77% White), we examined children's developing work habits from first to sixth grade and their developmental cascading effects on academic outcomes at the beginning and end of high school as well as at age 26. The findings on differential stability of work habits (i.e., bivariate correlations) suggest that children were likely to maintain their relative position among peers from first to sixth grade. The complementary findings on mean-level changes from the latent growth curves suggest that children's work habits exhibited mean-level increases over the same period, meaning that children's work habits became more advanced from first to sixth grade. Models used to examine the developmental cascades of work habits suggest that children's work habits at first grade and the growth in children's work habits from first to sixth grade (a) directly predicted their academic outcomes at the beginning and the end of high school, and (b) indirectly predicted their educational attainment at age 26 through their academic outcomes during adolescence. These findings underscore the importance of foundational noncognitive skills during middle childhood that predict individuals' academic outcomes up to 20 years later in adulthood.

Trajectories of Civic Socialization in Context: Examining Variation Among Children in African American and Black Immigrant Families	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Little is known about how developmental experiences spanning early childhood through adolescence prepare children and youth to engage with society, and even less so for ethnically diverse Black children and youth. Building from work linking positive youth development (PYD) to civic engagement, this study examined how socialization trajectories from early childhood through adolescence in concert with early childhood experiences and contexts related to adolescent civic development. Person-centered analysis (PCA) through trajectory modeling was conducted using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K). Family-level inclusion criteria was used to identify the subsample wherein at least 1 parent identified as Black or African American (N = 3,562); 49.5% of children were female. The ECLS-K component measure of socioeconomic status (SES) indicated that most families were from low SES backgrounds (54.5%), followed by middle and upper-middle class (36.4%,), then upper-middle class and beyond (9.1%). Civic development was measured by the PYD outcomes of competence, confidence, connection to school and peers, caring, and character, which have positively accounted for civic engagement across ethnically and racially diverse youth. Findings suggest that diversity in socialization experiences, sociocultural background, and context result in differential outcomes of civic development. This builds on previous civic engagement work by affirming the importance of parental perceptions, civic opportunity, socialization practices, and context. Moreover, this work highlights ethnic diversity among Black youth in civic development and suggests that being from an immigrant family is associated with differential civic outcomes relative to their nonimmigrant counterparts.

Career Adaptivity Mediates Longitudinal Links Between Parent-Adolescent Relationships and Young Adult Occupational Attainment	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study aimed to illuminate the implications of adolescents' relationships with mothers and fathers for their career development processes and, in turn, their occupational attainment in young adulthood across a 10-12-year period. Grounded in the career construction theory, which highlights adolescence as a significant period of preparation for career attainment and families' role in this process (Savickas, 2013), we tested the mediating effect of adolescent career adaptivity, a fundamental component of career adaptation, in the longitudinal links between mother- and father-adolescent relationship quality and young adult occupational prestige. We also compared mothers' and fathers' roles in these links and tested youth gender moderation. Data came from mothers, fathers, and 236 youth (122 firstborns and 114 secondborns; 53% female) from 147 European American working- to middle-class families. Structural equation modeling tested whether effects of relationships with mothers and fathers at Time 1 (adolescents' M-age = 15.17, SD=.96) were mediated by Time 2 (1 year later) adolescent career adaptivity, represented by academic performance, sense of control, and self-worth, in relation to occupational prestige at about age 26. Results showed that career adaptivity fully mediated the link between mother-adolescent relationship quality and young adult occupational prestige, but the effects of father-adolescent relationship quality were nonsignificant, though model comparison did not reveal a significant difference between mother and father effects. There were no differences by youth gender. Findings contribute to understanding of families' role in youth career development and future attainment and add to the literature on career construction theory.

Girls completed a measure of self-esteem when they were in Grades 5, 7, 10, and 12, and in Grade 12 their skin tone was rated on a 3-point scale (1 = Light, 2 = Medium, 3 = Dark). Girls with lighter skin reported higher self-esteem than dark and medium-toned girls in Grades 5 and 7, and their self-esteem remained high across the seven years of the study. The self-esteem of dark- and medium-skinned girls increased in high school such that at Grade 12, medium-skinned girls had higher self-esteem than dark-skinned girls, who did not differ from light-skinned girls.

Parents' Responses to Their Children's Performance: A Process Examination in the United States and China	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This research examined the idea that children's inferences about their parents' goals for them is a possible mechanism by which parents' responses to their children's performance contribute to children's psychological functioning. American (N = 447; M-age = 13.24 years; 49% girls; 95% European American) and Chinese (N = 439; M-age = 13.36 years; 52% girls) early adolescents reported on parents' responses to their performance, parents' self-worth and self-improvement goals for them, and their psychological functioning (e.g., subjective well-being) twice over a year. The more parents used success-oriented responses, the more their children inferred they held self-worth goals, which predicted enhanced psychological functioning among children over time. The more parents used failure responses, the more their children inferred they held self-improvement goals, but this did not underlie the tendency for parents' failure responses to predict poorer psychological functioning over time. These pathways tended to be stronger in the United States than China.

We used 20-year longitudinal data from the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Adult Development and Aging (ILSE) to examine the role of perceived work environment (autonomy, innovation, social integration, and stress) and work activities derived from an occupational database (related to information, to people, and manual activities) for trajectories of cognitive abilities (processing speed, fluid and crystallized intelligence). We used data from 374 participants in the ILSE midlife cohort (born 1950-52) who were working at baseline and had valid observations on work characteristics and control variables including education, gender, region (former East vs. West Germany), and personal income (mean age at baseline = 44 years, SD = 1, 44% women). Cognitively stimulating perceived work environments (higher levels of autonomy and innovation), higher levels of work activities related to information and people, and lower levels of manual activity at baseline were related to higher initial levels of cognitive ability. Higher work stress was related to higher baseline fluid ability. These associations were largely not independent of control variables. Higher social integration at work was related to less steep increase in crystallized intelligence and higher work stress was related to less decline in processing speed. In sum, our findings were more in line with selection rather than with enrichment effects, with the caveat that our findings rely on work variables taken at baseline. We discuss potential mechanisms underlying these findings.

Across approaches, physical punishment at ages 9-26 months predicted reductions in children's cognitive development of 0.08-0.21 SD at ages 27-46 months. These results, plus null results of falsification tests, strengthen the argument that physical punishment leads to slower cognitive growth and illustrate the utility of alternative statistical methods to reduce problems of selection bias in developmental research.

Persistence and Convergence: The End of Kindergarten Outcomes of Pre-K Graduates and Their Nonattending Peers	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The present investigation examined the benefits of pre-K through the end of kindergarten for children from low-income homes who lived in a large and diverse county (n = 2,581) as well as factors associated with a reduction in benefits during the kindergarten year. Results revealed that pre-K graduates outperformed nonattenders in the areas of achievement and executive functioning skills at the end of kindergarten, and also that the benefits of pre-K at the start of the year diminished by a little more than half. This convergence between groups' performance was largest for more constrained skills, such as letter-word identification, and was attributed to the fact that nonattenders made greater gains in kindergarten as compared with graduates of pre-K. Importantly, convergence in the groups' performance in kindergarten was not attributed to pre-K children's classroom experiences in kindergarten. Convergence was, however, attributable to preexisting individual differences, and there was support for the notion that even though children's skills are susceptible to improvement as a result of pre-K, their longer-term outcomes are likely to be impacted by factors that are outside the scope of early schooling.

Data included home interviews with adolescent mothers (N = 204), observations of mother-child interactions during a task that challenged children's abilities to manage their emotional arousal, and assessments of children's performance on measures of self-regulation and academic readiness. Adolescent mothers' higher depressive symptoms at child age 2 years were associated with a greater decline in mothers' emotion scaffolding from child age 2 to 5 years, which was subsequently linked to children's lower self-regulation and academic readiness at age 5. Possible implications from this line of work for adolescent mothers and their children are discussed.

Parents' Causal Talk: Links to Children's Causal Stance and Emerging Scientific Literacy	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												To explore the potential contribution of parents' causal talk to preschooler's emerging scientific literacy and related interests, we observed 153 parent-child dyads playing together in a museum and in the lab. As in previous work, the frequency with which parents referenced causal information in their speech predicted the strength of their children's causal stance. In addition, the frequency with which parents invited their children to explain causal phenomena. but not the frequency with which they provided explanations to their children, was related to children's scientific literacy. These associations held even when controlling for children's parent-reported exposure to science in the home, as well as their general cognitive skills. Although causal conclusions are precluded by the correlational design, this research is consistent with the possibility that parents begin shaping their children's scientific engagement and literacy when they are as young as three years of age.

Developmental Changes in Infants' and Children's Attention to Faces and Salient Regions Vary Across and Within Video Stimuli	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Visual attention in complex, dynamic scenes is attracted to locations that contain socially relevant features, such as faces, and to areas that are visually salient. Previous work suggests that there is a global shift over development such that observers increasingly attend to faces with age. However, no prior work has tested whether this shift is truly global, that is, consistent across and within stimuli despite variations in content. To test the global shift hypothesis, we recorded eye movements of 89 children (6 months to 10 years) and adults while they viewed 7 video clips. We measured the extent to which each participant attended to faces and to salient areas for each video. There was no evidence of global age-related changes in attention: Neither feature showed consistent increases or decreases with age. Moreover, windowed analyses within each stimulus video revealed significant moment-to-moment variations in the relation between age and each visual feature (via a bootstrapping analysis). For some time windows, adults looked more often at both feature types compared to infants and children. However, for other time windows, the pattern was reversed-younger participants looked more at faces and salient locations. Lack of consistent directional effects provides strong evidence against the global shift hypothesis. We suggest an alternative explanation: Over development, observers increasingly prioritize when and where to look by learning to track which features are relevant within a scene. Implications for the development of visual attention and children's understanding of screen-based media are discussed.

A Pupillometry Study of Multisensory Social and Linguistic Processing in Autism and Typical Development	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is characterized by impairments in social communication, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. Many studies have demonstrated atypical responses to audiovisual sensory inputs. particularly those containing sociolinguistic information. It is currently unclear whether these atypical responses are due to the linguistic nature of the inputs or the social aspect itself. Further, it is unclear how atypical sensory responses to sociocommunicative stimuli intersect with autism symptomatology. The current study addressed these outstanding questions by using pupillometry in mental age-matched children with and without autism (N = 71) to examine physiological responses to dynamic, audiovisual stimuli including social, sociolinguistic, socioemotional, and nonsocial stimuli, as well as to temporally manipulated stimuli. Data revealed group differences in pupillary responses with social stimuli but not nonsocial stimuli and, importantly, showed no variation through the inclusion of linguistic or emotional information. This suggests that atypical sensory responses are driven primarily by the inclusion of social information broadly. Further. individual responses to social stimuli were significantly correlated with a wide range of autism spectrum disorder symptomatology, including social communication, restricted interests and repetitive behaviors, and sensory processing issues. Pupillary responses to social but not nonsocial presentation were also capable of predicting diagnosis with a high level of selectivity, but only with marginal sensitivity. Finally, responses to the temporal manipulation did not yield any group differences. suggesting that while atypical multisensory temporal processing has been well documented in autism at the level of behavior and perception, these issues may be intact at the physiological level.

Here, we test the account that confidence constitutes a common currency for perceptual decisions even in childhood by examining whether confidence can be compared across distinct perceptual dimensions. We conducted a strict test of domain-generality in confidence reasoning by asking 6- to 7-year-olds to compare their confidence in 2 decisions, either from the same perceptual dimension (e.g., number vs. number) or from two different perceptual dimensions (e.g., area vs. emotion). Not only could children compare their confidence across and within domains but there were no differences in their abilities to make within- and across-domain comparisons. Our findings support the idea that confidence is represented in a common format even in childhood. which could provide an account for perceptual integration in childhood that doesn't necessitate the use of language.

Canadian Children's Concepts of National Groups: A Comparison With Children From the United States	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Understanding the development and structure of people's concepts of national groups can contribute to an understanding of their behavior in the political arena, including perhaps the recent rise in nationalism and anti-immigrant sentiment. Here, we provide a developmental investigation of concepts of national groups in a sample of 5- to 8-year-old Canadian children (N = 79). Using an extensive battery of measures, we assessed the extent to which children conceive of national groups as socially constructed versus as having deeper. perhaps biological. "essences" that shape their members' physical and psychological makeup. At younger ages, Canadian children tended to essentialize national groups, including in a biological sense. At older ages, the biological conception of national groups subsided, but children continued to view these groups as meaningful and informative. A statistical comparison with 5- to 8-year-old American children's responses to the same measures (N = 70; using data from Hussak & Cimpian, 2019) revealed a great degree of overlap, despite substantial differences between the two countries in how national identity is conceived and described. These findings add an important piece to our understanding of the development of concepts of national groups.

Family Meals Buffer the Daily Emotional Risk Associated With Family Conflict	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Family meals have been associated with positive adolescent outcomes in cross-sectional and longitudinal research. However, it is not known how adolescents experience family meals on a daily basis, and whether family meals buffer stresses associated with interpersonal conflicts on the daily level. To address this gap in the literature, adolescents (N = 396, 58% female, M-age = 14.57 years) completed diary checklists for up to 14 days, reporting their emotions, experiences of family and peer conflict, and whether they ate with their family that day. On days that adolescents shared a family meal. they felt greater happiness and role fulfillment, and less burnout and distress. Moreover, family conflict was associated with more negative emotionality only on days that adolescents did not also eat with the family. Findings suggest that family meals buffer daily risks associated with familial conflicts. Follow-up analyses suggest that these processes may be particularly important among older adolescents.

Cross-Race and Cross-Ethnic Friendships and Psychological Well-Being Trajectories Among Asian American Adolescents: Variations by School Context	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Asian American adolescents' cross-race friendships are poorly understood, partially due to the model minority stereotype. Using data from 915 Asian American adolescents from the National Longitudinal Study for Adolescent to Adult Health, the present study examined the influence of cross-race friendships (based on peer nomination data) on Asian American adolescents' psychological well-being trajectories, as well as the moderating role of school context (numeric marginalization, school prejudice). Results showed that cross-race friendships promoted Asian American adolescents' psychological well-being, particularly in early adolescence and in schools where adolescents lacked critical mass of same-race peers or where prejudice was widespread. Similar findings were observed for cross-race friendships with the majority group, and more evident effects emerged for cross-ethnic friendships.

Individuals' Math and Science Motivation and Their Subsequent STEM Choices and Achievement in High School and College: A Longitudinal Study of Gender and College Generation Status Differences	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Math and science motivational beliefs are essential in understanding students' science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) achievement and choices in high school and college. Drawing on the Eccles' expectancy-value theory and Arnett's emerging adulthood framework, this study examined the relations among high school students' motivational beliefs in ninth grade and their STEM course taking and grade point average (GPA) throughout high school as well as their STEM major choice in college. In addition, we examined subgroup differences across (a) gender and (b) college generation status by testing mean-level differences as well as whether these relations between math and science motivational beliefs and STEM outcomes varied by gender and college generation status. Using nationally representative data from the High School Longitudinal Study (N = 14,040; M-age = 14; 51% female students), this study found that adolescents' math and science motivational beliefs at the beginning of high school were positively associated with STEM achievement and course taking throughout high school and college major choices 7 years later. The results showed that female and first-generation college students had lower math and science self-concept of ability and were less likely to pursue a STEM major in college. However, in most cases, the relations among indicators did not vary by gender and college generation status. This study provided insights for policymakers and practitioners that gender and college generation gaps in STEM are evident at least by the beginning of high school and carry forward to their STEM college choices.

Identity Disruption and Its Association With Mental Health Among Veterans With Reintegration Difficulty	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Most research and theory on identity integration focuses on adolescents and young adults under age 30, and relatively little is known about how identity adjusts to major life events later in life. The purpose of the present study was to operationalize and investigate identity disruption, or a loss of temporal identity integration following a disruptive life event, within the developmental context of established adulthood and midlife. We used a mixed-methods approach to examine identity disruption among 244 Afghanistan and Iraq war veterans with reintegration difficulty who participated in an expressive writing intervention. Participants completed measures of social support, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom severity, satisfaction with life, and reintegration difficulty at baseline right before writing, and 3 and 6 months after the expressive writing intervention. The expressive writing samples were coded for identity disruption using thematic analysis. We hypothesized that identity disruption would be associated with lower social support, more severe PTSD symptoms, lower satisfaction with life, and greater reintegration difficulty at baseline. Forty-nine percent (n = 121) of the sample indicated identity disruption in their writing samples. Identity disruption was associated with more severe PTSD symptoms, lower satisfaction with life, and greater reintegration difficulty at baseline, and with less improvement in social support. The findings suggest that identity disruption is a meaningful construct for extending the study of identity development to established adult and midlife populations. and for understanding veterans' adjustment to civilian life.

However, recent studies have emphasized the possible heterogeneity of abstainers. We know little about the long-term adaption of delinquency abstainers. We identify subtypes of delinquency abstainers and investigate subsequent adult academic careers, income levels, and possible marginalization in the labor market. We use the population-based Young in Norway Longitudinal study, where participants (N = 2,494) are followed up by surveys and registers from their teens until their mid-30s. By means of latent class analysis, abstainers were divided in three groups according to degree of social integration. Results showed that delinquency abstainers performed as well or better in adulthood than those with moderate delinquency involvement and markedly better than the highly delinquent. Lonely abstainers performed just as well as all other groups when it comes to higher education and earnings. However, they had a higher probability of marginalization in the labor market than the social abstainers. We conclude that no group fared better than delinquency abstainers with strong social ties. The outcomes of the lonely abstainers were close to those of the majority. Thus, in this cohort who came of age in the 1990s. delinquency abstainers are not particularly vulnerable, and theory about abstainers needs to be modernized.					von Soest, Tilmann/P-4350-2014; Moffitt, Terrie/D-5295-2011	Moffitt, Terrie/0000-0002-8589-6760; Hart, Rannveig/0000-0003-3140-1942													0012-1649	1939-0599				NOV	2020	56	11					2167	2176		10.1037/dev0001117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001117								32986449					WOS:000584429000013

Sexual Identity Development Milestones in Three Generations of Sexual Minority People: A National Probability Sample	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Using data from the first national probability sample of Black, White, and Latinx sexual minority people in the United States, we examined whether and how sexual identity development timing and pacing differs across demographic subgroups at the intersections of cohort, sex, sexual identity, and race/ ethnicity. Among a sample of 1,491 participants aged 18-60 from 3 distinct birth cohorts, we measured participants' ages of sexual identity development milestones, including first same-sex attraction, first self-realization of a sexual minority identity, first same-sex sexual behavior, first disclosure to a straight friend, and first disclosure to a family member. Participants from more recent cohorts reported earlier and accelerated pacing of milestones relative to those from older cohorts. Subgroups defined by sex and sexual identity varied in milestone timing and pacing, with gay males reporting an earlier onset of some milestones than other subgroups. Those who used newer identity labels (e.g., pansexual, queer) reported younger ages of milestones relative to bisexual participants but similar ages to lesbian and gay participants. Black and Latinx participants reported some milestones at younger ages than White participants. Race-stratified models testing groups at the intersection of cohort, sex, and sexual identity revealed subgroup differences in ages of first disclosure to family, as well as differences in the time between self-realization, same-sex sexual behavior, and disclosure to a straight friend. The results suggest substantial variation in the developmental timing and pacing of milestones across social identities and the need to further examine how milestone timing is related to identity, stress, and health.

J	Abels, M				Abels, Monika			Triadic Interaction and Gestural Communication: Hierarchical and Child-Centered Interactions of Rural and Urban Gujarati (Indian) Caregivers and 9-Month-Old Infants	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												In this study 9-month-old infants in rural and urban Gujarat, India were compared in how frequently and in which way they engage in triadic interactions. It was assumed that urban caregivers would engage in a child-centered interaction style, frequently creating triadic interactions and following infants' signals. It was also expected that they would engage in more gestural communication in line with results on young infants often being involved in distal interactions. Rural caregivers were assumed to engage in a hierarchical interaction style in which the caregiver directs the interactions. It was expected that they would engage more in bodily ways of communicating as young infants in these communities often experience large amounts of proximal interactions. Infants were observed in everyday situations to assess their everyday engagement in triadic interactions and experience with gestures. Additionally, infants' mothers were asked to show their children something distant to assess how triadic attention is created. These interactions were video recorded and analyzed in terms of gestures and bodily behaviors. The results indicate that urban infants experience more triadic interactions and have caregivers who are more likely to follow their initiatives than rural infants. In the observations, urban caregivers also used gestures more frequently than rural caregivers. For rural infants the results are less clear with some indications that caregivers directed their attention more, particularly using their bodies.

The results from path analysis demonstrated that attuned caregiving during infancy predicted more joint attention in toddlerhood, which was in turn associated with better executive function performance in early childhood. Joint attention was a stronger predictor of executive functions for lower-income families. Moreover, joint attention mediated the relation between attuned caregiving and executive functions, and this mediation was amplified for lower-income families. These results highlight joint attention as a key mechanism through which attuned caregiving supports the development of executive functions, particularly for low-income families.

Child core language skill and the quality of the home learning environment were each stable across waves, and the two covaried at each wave. Over and above these stabilities and concurrent correlations, and net child social competence and maternal education, higher quality stimulation and support in the home learning environment at each wave advanced children's core language skill at each subsequent wave, and reciprocally children with more advanced core language skill at each wave stimulated a higher quality home learning environment at each subsequent wave. These transactions were robust across child gender, ethnicity, birth order, and developmental risk. This bidirectionality shows that children consistently affect their environments from infancy to adolescence and underscores that the home learning environment is a worthy intervention target for improving core language skill in children regardless of age.

J	Ponari, M; Norbury, CF; Vigliocco, G				Ponari, Marta; Norbury, Courtenay Frazier; Vigliocco, Gabriella			The Role of Emotional Valence in Learning Novel Abstract Concepts	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												A recent study by Ponari, Norbury, and Vigliocco (2018), showed that emotional valence (i.e. whether a word evokes positive, negative, or no affect) predicts age-of-acquisition ratings and that up to the age of 8-9, children know abstract emotional words better than neutral ones. On the basis of these findings, emotional valence has been argued to provide a bootstrapping mechanism for the acquisition of abstract concepts. However, no previous work has directly assessed whether words' valence, or valence of the context in which words are used, facilitates learning of unknown abstract words. Here, we investigate whether valence supports acquisition of novel abstract concepts. Seven to 10 year old children were taught novel abstract words and concepts (words typically learned at an older age that the children did not know); words were either valenced (positive or negative) or neutral. We also manipulated the context in which words were presented: For 1 group of children, the teaching strategy emphasized emotional information; for the other, it emphasized encyclopedic, nonemotional information. Abstract words with emotional valence were learned better than neutral abstract words by children up to the age of 8-9, replicating previous findings; no effect of teaching strategy was found. These results indicate that emotional valence supports abstract concepts acquisition and further suggest that it is the valence information intrinsic to the word's meaning to have a role, rather than the valence of the context in which the word is learned.

"When Something Like a Ladybug Lands on You": Origins and Development of the Concept of Luck	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												In Study 1, 103 children ages 4 through 10 answered questions about their concept of and belief in luck, and completed a story task assessing their use of luck as an explanation for events. The interview captured a curvilinear trajectory of children's belief in luck from tentative belief at age 4 to full belief at age 6, weakening belief at age 8, and significant skepticism by age 10. The youngest children appeared to think of luck simply as a positive outcome; with age, children increasingly considered the unexpected nature of lucky outcomes and many came to view luck as synonymous with chance. On the story task, younger children attributed a stronger role to luck in explaining events than did older children. Studies 2 and 3 explored 2 potential sources of children's concepts. Study 2 explored adult use of the words luck and lucky, and found that most of this input consisted in using lucky to refer to positive outcomes, although the nature of use changed with the ages of the children. In Study 3, we examined children's storybooks about luck and found them to be rich potential sources of children's concepts.

However, this literature relies on several different tasks to assess SFON with distinct task demands, making it unclear to what extent these tasks measure the same underlying construct. Moreover, prior studies have investigated SFON in the context of small sets exclusively, but no work has explored whether children demonstrate SFON for large sets and how this relates to children's math ability. In the current study, preschoolers were presented four distinct SFON tasks assessing their spontaneous attention to number for small (Experiment 1) and large (Experiment 2) sets of numbers. Results revealed performance across the four distinct SFON tasks was unrelated. Moreover, preschooler's SFON for small sets (1-4 items) was significantly stronger than that for large sets (10-40 items), and analyses revealed that number knowledge was only associated with SFON for small sets and not large. Together, findings suggest that SFON may not be a set-size-independent construct and instead may hinge upon a child's number knowledge, at least in the preschool years. The role of number language and how it relates to children's SFON are discussed.

Yet, it is unclear how comprehension of the words that capture spatial relations, words like behind and under, might be associated with children's early spatial and mathematics skills. The current study addressed this question by conducting a moderated mediation model to test the potential moderating effects of group factors, such as socioeconomic status (SES) and gender, on the possible mediation of spatial language comprehension on the association between spatial skill and mathematics performance. In total, 192 3-year-olds were tested on a battery of assessments, including a novel Spatial Language Comprehension Task, a test of spatial skills (2- and 3-dimensional trials of the Test of Spatial Assembly [2D and 3D TOSA, respectively]), and a composite of 2 mathematical assessments. The results indicate that this novel Spatial Language Comprehension Task is a reliable measure useful for examining group differences and the early space-math link. Specifically, higher-SES preschoolers and females had higher spatial language comprehension compared with their lower-SES peers and males, respectively. These SES and gender disparities in spatial language comprehension are concerning, given the strong association between spatial language comprehension and mathematics skills. Additionally, spatial language comprehension mediated the association between spatial skill and mathematics performance for females only. Future work should examine the potential causal role that spatial language comprehension may have in concurrent and later spatial and mathematics skills.

Although loneliness is a public health challenge, we know little about how loneliness develops during these periods. Our study addresses this lacuna by using 4-wave longitudinal data from 3,116 Norwegians aged 13 to 31 years, making use of questionnaire (key facets and correlates of loneliness) and register linkage information (midlife outcomes). Analyses revealed that when asking directly about feeling lonely and for emotional facets, loneliness increased from early adolescence to age mid-20s, whereas social facets of loneliness declined gradually and plateaued when people had reached their mid-20s. Several predictors operated consistently across loneliness facets, whereas others operated in facet-specific ways. To illustrate, perceiving one's parents as caring, having close friends, not leaving the parental home before age 18, and reporting more agency were each associated with less loneliness across assessment modes. In contrast, when asked directly, women reported more loneliness than men at all ages, whereas men reported more social loneliness. Finally, adolescents and young adults who reported feeling lonely and/or increased in loneliness were consistently at higher risk for disability and lower income in midlife, whereas other important midlife outcomes including education, labor market inclusion, and prescriptions of antidepressants exhibited facet-specific associations. Our study is the first to provide a comprehensive picture of loneliness development throughout the second and third decade of life and highlights the multidimensionality and multidirectionality of loneliness trajectories and correlates across adolescence and early adulthood.

J	Rote, WM; Smetana, JG; Feliscar, L				Rote, Wendy M.; Smetana, Judith G.; Feliscar, Lovia			Longitudinal Associations Between Adolescent Information Management and Mother-Teen Relationship Quality: Between-Versus Within-Family Differences	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Parent-adolescent relationships are related to adolescents' disclosure and concealment, but these associations may represent between-family differences (e.g., families with more negative interactions have adolescents who disclose less) or within-family processes (e.g., when a family has more negative interactions, their adolescent discloses less). This study used cross-lagged panel modeling (CLPM) and random-intercept cross-lagged panel modeling (RI-CLPM) to separate these elements. U.S. adolescents (N = 214, M-age = 16.0, 52% female) reported on their disclosure, concealment, positive relationships, and negative interactions with mothers 3 times over a year. Consistent with prior research, adolescent disclosure was transactionally associated with more positive and less negative relationships with mothers over time in between-family (CLPM) analyses. However, in the within-family (RI-CLPM) analyses, which controlled for the fact that more positive and less negative families had adolescents who disclosed more, changes in relationship quality within a family were not linked with changes in disclosure. In contrast, negative interactions and greater concealment were reciprocally related over time both between families and within families, even when considering that families with more negative interactions also had adolescents who concealed more. Positive relationships were associated with less adolescent concealment, but only relative to other families (at the between level) and not over time. Results confirm the importance of examining disclosure and concealment as separate processes, particularly at the within-family level, and indicate that the cycle of concealment and negative interactions among troubled families may be a particularly ripe area for intervention.

Civic Development Across the Transition to Adulthood in a National US Sample: Variations by Race/Ethnicity, Parent Education, and Gender	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Despite a growing understanding about civic development, we know little about whether the developmental course of civic engagement is the same across different types of civic engagement or different groups of youth. To advance developmental science in this area, we documented age-related change in community service, political interest, electoral participation, and political voice across the transition to adulthood by race/ethnicity, parent education, gender, and their interactions. National multicohort probability samples of U.S. high school seniors from the Monitoring the Future study were assessed at baseline (age 18) and followed longitudinally via self-administered mail surveys across 6 follow-up waves to age 29/30. Of the sample (N = 12,557), 51.0% were women, 11.0% were Black, 7.0% were Latinx, 2.3% were Asian, and 75.4% were White. Community service decreased from age 18 to 24, then showed modest recovery. Political interest, electoral participation, and political voice increased steadily from 18 to 24 and less steeply thereafter. Intercepts and (to some extent) slopes varied by race/ethnicity, parent education, gender, and intersections of these factors. Black youth started and remained highest in community service and showed more accelerated growth in political interest and electoral participation. Young women reported higher community service, whereas gender gaps in political engagement trajectories favored young men. Black and Latinx young women stood out as having distinct civic trajectories. The role of parent education varied by race/ethnicity and gender. Diverse civic pathways advance theoretical understanding of civic development.

To examine both stability and change in identity development, an explanatory mixed-methods design was employed. First, patterns of identity status development across early adulthood were examined, followed by an in-depth qualitative approach to understand more about the processes within identity status stability from the late 20s into the 30s. Analyses revealed group-level changes in identity status across ages 25 (M-age = 24.9, SD = 0.7), 29 (M-age = 29.3, SD = 0.6), and 33 (M-age = 33.3, SD = 0.5) among the 118 participants, with fewer individuals in moratorium and more in identity achievement in later years. Stable identity statuses with established commitments (identity achievement and foreclosure) were by far the most common patterns across early adulthood. To understand how early adults maintain their identity within these stable patterns, we employed longitudinal qualitative analyses of identity status interviews from ages 29 and 33. These analyses revealed 3 processes of identity development: approach to change (willingness to adjust and evolve previously established commitments), story integration (thematic and temporal integration, and metaexploration of previous identity work), and participation in a broader life context (identity expanding beyond personal aspirations). Together, these findings show that there is identity status change toward maturity across early adulthood and high stability within individual patterns. The findings also show that stable identity achievement facilitates further deepening within the three processes of identity development, and that stable foreclosure can be connected to both weakening and deepening in identity development.

J	Best, JR				Best, John R.			Physical Fitness and Age-Related Differences in Cognition and Cortical Thickness in Young Adulthood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The association between physical fitness and age-related differences in cognition and brain structure has been studied fairly extensively during development and aging, yet comparatively less in young adulthood. The current study examined 1,195 young adults aged 22 to 36 (54% female; 67% Caucasian) to better understand associations between physical fitness- grip strength and submaximal cardiovascular endurance-and age-related differences in executive function (EF), memory, and average cortical thickness. EF, memory, and cortical thickness were negatively associated with age, and higher endurance was positively associated with EF and memory. Neither physical fitness measure associated with cortical thinning. To follow-up on these analyses, data from monozygotic (n = 149 pairs) and dizygotic (n = 93 pairs) twins were used to estimate the degree to which heritability versus environment might contribute to the observed associations between cognition and endurance. Environmental effects shared by monozygotic and dizygotic twins alike were estimated to account for roughly 50% of the correlation between endurance and cognition (EF and memory). Heritability and nonshared environmental effects were inconsistent across EF and memory. Overall, these findings suggest an association between cardiovascular endurance and age-related differences in cognition in young adulthood and that these associations may be independent of cortical thinning. Whereas there was consistent evidence for a moderate contribution of the shared environment, there was limited and inconsistent evidence for a role of heritability.

Most empirical research on ostracism has been carried out in the lab or focused on samples in specific contexts. Here, we investigate the effects of age on how individuals experience ostracism within a broad, representative sample of the adult German population (the Socio-Economic Panel). We find a generally negative relation between ostracism and age, such that older adults report experiencing ostracism less frequently. Further analyses show that a particular dip in the ostracism frequency curve around the age of 65 might be at least partly due to leaving the workforce. We further investigate cross-sectional as well as longitudinal effects of age on relations between ostracism frequency and psychological well-being, showing relatively stable associations between ostracism and negative emotions, reduced life satisfaction, as well as dysfunctional social behavior across the adult life span.

The antecedents consisted of individual (i.e., ego-resilient personality, intelligence, language ability, gender, and ethnicity) and contextual factors (i.e., maternal support and responsiveness, family socioeconomic adversity, teacher- child relationship conflict, and peer rejection). We identified 4 distinct codevelopment patterns including a chronic co-occurring group (30.1%), a moderate co-occurring group (28.5%), a pure-externalizing group (18.6%), and a low-risk group (22.8%). While children who belonged to any of the 3 higher risk groups exhibited more adverse early childhood antecedents compared with the low-risk group, the chronic co-occurring group displayed the most severe profiles of early childhood antecedents compared with the moderate co-occurring and the pure-externalizing groups. Common antecedents for the 3 higher risk groups were lower ego-resilient personality, higher teacher-child relationship conflict, being male, and being African American. Low language ability and peer rejection were identified as unique antecedents for the chronic co-occurring group.

But do these behaviors and their benefits cross these modality boundaries? We investigated mothers' infant-directed speech and actions while they demonstrated the action-effects of 4 novel objects to their 14-month-old infants. Mothers (N = 35) spent the majority of the time either speaking or demonstrating the to-be-learned actions to their infant while hardly talking and acting at the same time. Moreover, mothers' infant-directed speech predicted infants' action learning success beyond the effect of infant-directed actions. Thus, mothers' speech modulations during naturalistic interactions do more than support infants' language learning; they also facilitate infants' action learning, presumably by directing and maintaining infants' attention toward the to-be learned actions.

Glenn			Rhythm and Syntax Processing in School-Age Children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Scholars debate whether musical and linguistic abilities are associated or independent. In the present study, we examined whether musical rhythm skills predict receptive grammar proficiency in childhood. In Experiment 1, 7- to 17-year-old children (N = 68) were tested on their grammar and rhythm abilities. In the grammar-comprehension task, children heard short sentences with subject-relative (e.g., "Boys that help girls are nice") or object-relative (e.g., "Boys that girls help are nice") clauses, and determined the gender of the individual performing the action. In the rhythm-discrimination test, children heard two short rhythmic sequences on each trial and decided if they were the same or different. Children with better performance on the rhythm task exhibited higher scores on the grammar test, even after holding constant age, gender, music training, and maternal education. In Experiment 2, we replicated this finding with another group of same-age children (N = 96) while further controlling for working memory. Our data reveal, for the first time, an association between receptive grammar and rhythm perception in typically developing children. This finding is consistent with the view that music and language share neural resources for rule-based temporal processing.

Effects of Age and Bilingualism on Sensitivity to Native and Nonnative Tone Variation: Evidence From Spoken Word Recognition in Mandarin Chinese Learners	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Most children learn a language such as Mandarin Chinese that uses lexical tone to communicate meaning. This study aimed to examine the phonological specificity of tone representations in monolingual and bilingual learners of Mandarin. Two age-groups were tested: toddlers (2.5 to 3.5 years) and preschoolers (4 to 5 years; N = 80). Using a preferential looking paradigm, children were presented with correct and mispronounced (Cantonese or Mandarin tone substitutions) forms of familiar words. In the aggregate, participants demonstrated preferential fixation to visual targets (naming effects) for correctly pronounced words, words mispronounced with native (Mandarin) tone substitutions, and for words mispronounced with nonnative (Cantonese) tone substitutions. However, naming effects were greater for correct pronunciations and for Cantonese tone mispronunciations relative to Mandarin tone mispronunciations. There were no interactions of responses to each trial type with age or with language exposure. Results are discussed in terms of possible determinants of tone sensitivity in early childhood.

J	Labotka, D; Gelman, SA				Labotka, Danielle; Gelman, Susan A.			The Development of Children's Identification of Foreigner Talk	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Although children's use of speech registers such as Baby Talk is well documented, little is known about their understanding of Foreigner Talk, a register addressed to non-native speakers. In Study 1, 4- to 8-year-old children and adults (N = 125) heard 4 registers (Foreigner Talk, Baby Talk, Peer Talk, and Teacher Talk) and predicted who would receive each. By 5 years, children selected the target addressee of Foreigner Talk above chance. In Study 2, 5- to 8-year-old children and adults (N = 94) completed a register match task manipulating 3 addressee cues: language, appearance, and origin. Prior to 7-8 years of age, children did not use the language cue alone when identifying the addressee of Foreigner Talk, and at no age did children use one cue more than another. In contrast, adults made use of language and appearance more than the origin cue. These findings suggest that an understanding of Foreigner Talk emerges by school age yet also undergoes developmental change.

In this developmental study, we examined the hypothesis that STM for serial order supports online grapheme-to-phoneme conversion processes during the initial stages of reading acquisition, whereas the LTL of serial order serves reading abilities at later stages, when reading starts to rely on more stable, long-term orthographic representations. We followed a sample of 116 French-speaking children from first (Time 1 [T1]) grade of primary school through second (Time 2 [T2]) and third (Time 3 [T3]) grade. Their serial order STM and LTL abilities as well as their reading abilities were assessed. Overall, we observed that early reading abilities were only predicted by serial order STM performance, while more advanced reading abilities were predicted by both serial order STM and LTL performance. These results point toward a predictive role of serial order memory performance in reading acquisition and suggest that serial order STM and LTL support reading at different stages of acquisition. We further discuss our findings in the light of advancing knowledge about the relationship between memory and reading.

Development of Multiple Object Tracking via Multifocal Attention	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Multifocal attention is the ability to simultaneously attend to multiple objects, and is critical for typical functioning. Although adults are able to use multifocal attention, little is known about the development of this ability. In two experiments, we investigated multifocal attention in 6-8-year-old children and adults using a child-friendly, computerized multiple object tracking task designed to encourage the use of multifocal attention. We also investigated whether multifocal attention in children is deployed independently across left and right hemifields of vision, as in adults. Our results suggest that children's capacity for multifocal attention increases significantly across middle childhood. We also found evidence that at least one signature of hemifield-independent multifocal attention, the bilateral field advantage, can be observed in children.

In 87 families, each parent rated their child's (M-age = 4.07 years, SD = 0.80) emotion regulation and discussed a positive and a negative memory with their child (resulting in 275 conversations). Multilevel analyses showed that children's rated engagement during the conversation was higher when parents were observed to use autonomy-supportive, elaborative, and positive evaluative reminiscing, while children's rated disaffection was predicted by low autonomy support, low elaboration, and negative evaluation. Parental positive evaluation also related positively to children's memory performance. With respect to emotion regulation, only parents' negative evaluation when talking about negative memories related to higher emotional lability.

J	Van Lissa, CJ; Keizer, R				Van Lissa, Caspar J.; Keizer, Renske			Mothers' and Fathers' Quantitative and Qualitative Parenting in Relation to Children's Emotional Adjustment: A Between- and Within-Family	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This longitudinal study of Australian families (n = 1,884, from age 6-12) examined how fathers' and mothers' quantitative involvement (time spent on childcare) and qualitative involvement (specific parenting behaviors) relate to children's emotional adjustment development. We used dynamic structural equation modeling to disentangle stable between-family differences from within-family fluctuations in qualitative parenting and emotional adjustment, allowing us to investigate the direction of effects between parents and children. Because fathers have been theorized to contribute uniquely to emotional adjustment development, we examined differences between mothers and fathers and the interplay between parent and child sex. We further examined whether between-family differences in quantitative involvement, operationalized as joint (total) and relative (one parent does more) involvement, predict qualitative parenting behaviors and emotional adjustment and moderate the within-family interplay between them. Results revealed between-family correlations of qualitative involvement with emotional adjustment. Evidence for significant average within-family effects was limited to a parenting effect of maternal warmth, and several child effects, which indicated that emotional adjustment evokes changes in parenting. However, parenting effects varied substantially across families, especially for fathers. Between-family differences in quantitative involvement explained some of these differences. When joint quantitative involvement was higher, both parents engaged in more desirable qualitative parenting. When mothers were relatively more involved than fathers, fathers displayed less desirable qualitative parenting, and children were less well adjusted. There was some limited evidence that within-family predictive effects were moderated by quantitative involvement, particularly relative involvement. These findings suggest that all family members benefit from a more equal childcare distribution.

Prosocial Skills Causally Mediate the Relation Between Effective Classroom Management and Academic Competence: An Application of Direction Dependence Analysis	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Direction dependence analysis (DDA) is a recently developed method that addresses the need for more sophisticated tools to evaluate causal mechanisms of developmental processes and interventions. The present study applied DDA to evaluate the hypothesized mediators of a classroom behavior management training program on student academic competence. The study involved a group randomized controlled trial with 105 teachers and 1,818 students (K-3rd grade) in a large urban school district in the United States. Analyses revealed only student prosocial skill development causally mediated the intervention's effects on student academic competence. The findings support the importance of explicit instruction and coaching of student social skills as part of classroom behavior management programs and confirm the causal link between prosocial skills and academic success. The findings are discussed with regard to implications for future applications of DDA in developmental research.

J	Zhang, LW				Zhang, Liwei			A Latent Class Analysis of Multifaceted Economic Experience and Socioemotional Well-Being of Children of Immigrants	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Developmental studies have consistently argued for consideration of contextual influences on children's socioemotional well-being. This is particularly true among children of immigrants, who have highly diverse social, cultural, and economic backgrounds. Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten, this study disentangled the variation of socioemotional well-being among children of immigrants in the United States by looking at country of origin and their multifaceted economic experiences. The study first examined the economic lives of children of immigrants by conducting a latent class analysis with 3 dimensions-depth, duration, and income volatility from kindergarten to fifth grade. It further investigated how multifaceted economic experiences shaped the socioemotional perceptions of children of immigrants by considering country of origin. Findings from this study support both the immigrant risk and immigrant paradox perspectives, depending on country of origin, patterns of economic experiences, and the examined socioemotional domain. Children of immigrants generally perceived themselves to have a worse locus of control, self-concept, and internalizing symptoms at eighth grade than their peers of native-born parents. After considering the economic circumstances of these families, the picture was no longer straightforward. Children of South East Asian and East Asian origins reported worse socioemotional well-being than their White peers of native-born parents in chronic near-poor circumstances. Otherwise, most children of immigrants fared as well as their White children of native-born parents under similar economic conditions. Findings underscore the importance of country of origin and economic experiences in accounting for the variations of socioemotional well-being among children of immigrants.

The Development of Academic and Nonacademic Race Stereotypes in African American Adolescents	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The purpose of this longitudinal study was to examine developmental change and gender differences in the Black-White race stereotype endorsement of African American adolescents. In Grades 7, 10, and 12, African American students (N = 563; 313 girls) reported their perceptions of the competence of Blacks and Whites in academic, music, and sports domains. Multilevel growth modeling (MLM) was used to assess change from Grade 7 to Grade 12. Separate models tested academic (English, math, science) and nonacademic (music and sports) stereotypes. Across time points, students reported higher competence for Whites than Blacks in English, math, and science and higher competence for Blacks in music and sports. Academic stereotype endorsement increased between Grades 7 and 10, and students' endorsement of music and sports stereotypes decreased over time. Girls endorsed race stereotypes favoring Whites in math and science more strongly than boys. Boys reported stronger sports stereotypes than girls. Results highlight the value of intersectional approaches to studying stereotypes, as factors linked to gender identity may play a role in Black youths' race stereotype endorsement.

Parents' Peer Restriction in the United States and China: A Longitudinal Study of Early Adolescents	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This research examined parents' restriction of children's peer relationships in the United States and China. American and Chinese children (N = 934; M-age = 12.67 years) reported on their parents' peer restriction (e.g., limiting children's time with peers) and their behavioral and psychological adjustment 3 times over a year. Increments in parents' peer restriction predicted decrements in children's adjustment over time to a similar extent in the United States and China. However, decrements in children's adjustment predicted increments in parents' peer restriction over time to a greater extent in the United States (vs. China). Thus, it is possible that culture contributes to the socialization process involving parents' restriction of children's peer relationships but only via child-driven pathways.					xiong, yu/JAX-3589-2023	Qin, Lili/0000-0002-7820-7269; xiong, yu/0000-0003-2951-1026													0012-1649	1939-0599				SEP	2020	56	9					1760	1774		10.1037/dev0001088	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001088								32672995					WOS:000566725900012

Adolescents and parents completed the Parental Authority Index (PAI) assessing perceptions of parental control over personal, prudential-conventional, and overlapping issues. Adolescents recorded daily conflicts with parents over 2 weeks on private blogs through an online platform. Significant relationships were found between adolescent BSI scores for internalizing disorders (anxiety, somatization, interpersonal sensitivity) and their scores on the PAI for perceptions of parental control over personal issues as well as actions that overlapped personal with conventional and prudential considerations. Blog data revealed that two thirds of these urban Chinese parent-adolescent conflicts were about regulation of adolescent daily activities and issues directly impacting adolescent personal choice. Adolescents considered the majority of these conflicts as personal issues, and those who reported perceiving a higher level of parental control over their personal issues had significantly more daily conflicts with their parents. In addition, significant associations were found between reported actual daily conflicts and adolescent internalizing disorders: The greater the intensity of conflicts as experienced by the adolescents, the higher adolescents scored on the BSI subscale for depression; the less fair adolescents rated the conflict resolution and the less positively they felt about the process that led to the outcome, the higher they scored on the BSI subscales for interpersonal sensitivity and depression.						, Min/0000-0002-7618-4841													0012-1649	1939-0599				SEP	2020	56	9					1775	1786		10.1037/dev0001053	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001053								32658499					WOS:000566725900013

Mark			Interparental Conflict as a Curvilinear Risk Factor of Youth Emotional and Cortisol Reactivity	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examined interparental conflict as a linear and curvilinear predictor of subsequent changes in adolescents' negative emotional reactivity and cortisol functioning during family conflict and, in turn, their psychological difficulties. In addition, adolescents' negative emotional reactivity and cortisol functioning during family conflict were examined as subsequent predictors of their psychological difficulties. Participants included 258 adolescents (52% girls) and their parents and teachers who participated in 3 annual measurement occasions. Adolescents were 13 years old on average (standard deviation [SD] = .57) at the first measurement occasion, were generally from middle- and working-class backgrounds, and identified mostly as White (e.g., 74%). The results of latent-difference score analyses indicated that a multimethod and multiinformant assessment of interparental conflict linearly predicted subsequent changes in observational ratings of adolescent emotional reactivity and their overall cortisol output in response to family conflict over a 1-year period. These changes, in turn, predicted increases in multiinformant reports of adolescent psychological problems over a 2-year period. However, the linear association in the first link in the cascade was qualified by the quadratic effects of interparental conflict as a predictor. Consistent with risk-saturation models, the relatively strong associations among interparental conflict and youth emotional reactivity and cortisol output at mild and moderate exposure to conflict weakened as exposure to conflict reached higher levels.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				SEP	2020	56	9					1787	1802		10.1037/dev0001037	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001037								32567867					WOS:000566725900014

At the same time, our experiences in these relationships may affect our personality. Who experiences specific major relationship events, and how do these events relate to personality development? We examined this issue based on data from a nationally representative household panel study from Germany (N = 49,932). In this study, the occurrence of major relationship events (moving in with a partner, marriage, separation, and divorce) was assessed yearly, and the Big Five personality traits were measured repeatedly in 2005, 2009, 2013, and 2017 with the short version of the Big Five Inventory. We applied multilevel analyses to simultaneously model selection effects as well as different types of personality changes in the years before and after these events in the total sample and separately in women and men. Our findings revealed that less agreeable individuals were more likely to experience each of the examined relationship events. Moreover, each event was associated with personality changes, which only occurred after (not before) these events and considerably varied by event and gender. Individuals who moved in with a partner, got married, or separated from a partner primarily experienced changes in openness in the first year thereafter, and individuals who separated from a partner or got divorced became less emotionally stable in the following years. However, there was little evidence for "maturation" effects, except that individuals who moved in with a partner (especially men) became more conscientious in the following years.

Hidden populations are generally minoritized populations embedded in larger systems of oppression and inequality encapsulated within historical time and place, and importantly, they are underrepresented in developmental science. The set of 8 empirical articles discusses how being "hidden" is contextualized and operationalized through explicit and implicit ways and uses multiple methodologies to elucidate the experiences of children, youth, and families. The collection of articles is grounded in developmental and sociocultural developmental theories highlighting important cultural and contextual developmental mechanisms that impact and promote the well-being of hidden populations. Thematically, the set of articles, implicitly and explicitly, addresses minoritization and its consequences as well as elucidates resilience through multiple processes at different levels. Together, the special section advances developmental science by diversifying the populations that are represented to understand normative and culturally and contextually dependent development.

Hidden Among the Hidden: Transracially Adopted Korean American Adults Raising Multiracial Children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The parenting practices of both transracially adopted Korean American adults and multiracial families are often overlooked in developmental science, yet are important to address, given that the majority of Korean adoptees are now adults with families of their own and given rapid increases in the multiracial population. This qualitative study examined the cultural socialization beliefs and practices among transracially adopted Korean Americans who are parents of multiracial Asian-White children. Drawing upon interviews with 31 Korean adoptee parents (29 female; M-age = 41.26), we identified four themes that capture parents' understanding of their children's multiracial identities, how that understanding subsequently shapes their cultural socialization practices, and how parents' socialization beliefs and practices vary by developmental stage. These themes described the ways that parents' cultural socialization practices were shaped by their children's phenotypes, parents' understanding of their children's multiracial identities, geographic location, and the multiracial family context. This study also demonstrated how multiracial couples in our sample engaged in cultural socialization together. Results suggest that Korean adoptee parents largely acknowledged their children's multiracial identities through labels, but primarily socialized children as monoracial minorities.

Prior work has proposed that parents can strengthen adolescents' group belonging and motivate their civic engagement, but this mediating link has not been empirically tested. Moreover, parents' religious socialization and adolescents' religious identity remain understudied, especially with respect to possible daily fluctuations. We used experience sampling methods to: (a) explore momentary fluctuations and temporal relations between two dimensions of Muslim American adolescents' religious identity (i.e., private regard and centrality) over the course of 14 days (Phase 2), and (b) examine if Muslim American adolescents' momentary religious identity (Phase 2) mediated associations between their stable perceptions of maternal religious socialization (Phase 1) and subsequent civic engagement (Phase 3). Dynamic structural equation modeling revealed positive autoregressive and cross-lagged relations between religious private regard and centrality. Moreover, adolescents' momentary religious identities differentially mediated the associations between maternal religious socialization and civic attitudes and behaviors, suggesting specificity in these developmental processes. Our findings have important implications for programs and policies to support the self-empowerment and positive development of Muslim American adolescents.

The mixed-methods approach combined convergent and exploratory sequential designs to explore the breadth and depth of Latinx parents' messages to their children regarding race and ethnicity. Qualitative data were used to generate hypotheses that were tested quantitatively. Analysis of interviews revealed parents' concerns with obeying the law, avoiding interaction with others, teaching children how to deal with discrimination, the importance of transmitting their culture, and concerns for their children's ever-present fear and stress. Path analysis showed that undocumented parents utilized more cultural socialization and promotion of mistrust messages than their documented counterparts. More promotion of mistrust, in turn, was associated with higher levels of adolescent depressive symptoms. Given the current sociopolitical climate and ethnic-racial tensions in the United States, it is imperative to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the nuanced ERS practices Latinx families employ to both cope with and respond to this situation.

Familism in Action in an Emerging Immigrant Community: An Examination of Indirect Effects in Early Adolescence	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Familism values promote the positive adaptation of Latinx youth, but few studies have examined potential indirect effects associated with these positive effects. In emerging immigrant communities, where fewer resources are available to youth and families to maintain cultural values and ties, familism may be especially important. In this study of 175 primarily second-generation Latinx youth in such a community, we tested whether familism values were indirectly associated with adolescent outcomes through positive parent-child relationships, private racial/ethnic regard, meaning in life, and support seeking coping. Familism values were associated with greater academic motivation. Additionally, there were significant indirect effects in terms of positive parent-child relationships explaining the links between familism and fewer parent-reported externalizing symptoms, and for meaning in life explaining the links between familism and fewer depressive symptoms and greater academic motivation. Familism was also associated with greater support seeking coping, but this was associated with greater depressive symptoms. Our study suggests that in an emerging immigrant community familism values are primarily associated with positive adaptation through distinct mechanisms.

Race-Related Stress, Racial Identity, and Activism Among Young Black Men: A Person-Centered Approach	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The current study examines how race-related stress, physiological and psychological anticipation of racism, relates to low-risk and high-risk activism orientations for Black adolescent boys and emerging adult men (N = 286). We investigate whether patterns of racial identity and age moderate those relationships. We found that physiological and psychological anticipation of racism were related to low-risk Black community activism orientation, and those relationships varied by age and racial identity. The relationship between physiological anticipation of racism and high-risk activism orientation was moderated by racial identity profiles. For Black adolescent boys and emerging adult men with racial identity profiles that support individual and communal value of Blackness, more physiological anticipation was related to a greater likelihood of engaging in risky activism in the future. Findings highlight the importance of understanding how stress responses to racism influence youth commitments to future activism. These findings also underscore heterogeneity of racial identity among Black adolescent boys and emerging adult men, and how patterns of racial identity and age differentially influence orientations toward activism against racial oppression.

J	Brown, GL; Kogan, SM; Cho, JH				Brown, Geoffrey L.; Kogan, Steven M.; Cho, Junhan			Pathways Linking Childhood Trauma to Rural, Unmarried, African American Father Involvement Through Oxytocin Receptor Gene Methylation	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Father involvement contributes uniquely to children's developmental outcomes. The antecedents of father involvement among unmarried, African American fathers from rural areas, however, have been largely overlooked. The present study tested a conceptual model linking retrospective reports of childhood trauma and early adulthood social instability to father involvement among unmarried, African American men living in resource-poor, rural communities in the southeastern United States. We hypothesized these factors would influence father involvement indirectly, via DNA methylation of the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR). A sample of 192 fathers participated in 3 waves of data collection in early adulthood. Fathers reported on social instability at Wave 1; OXTR methylation was assessed via saliva samples at Wave 2; and measures of father involvement, retrospective childhood trauma, and quality of the fathers' relationships with their children's mothers were collected at Wave 3. Structural equation modeling indicated that childhood trauma was related directly to reduced levels of father involvement and to increased social instability. Social instability was associated with elevated levels of OXTR methylation, which in turn predicted decreased father involvement. The indirect effect from social instability to father involvement via OXTR methylation was significant. These associations did not operate through fathers' relationship with the child's mother and remained significant even accounting for associations between interparental relationship quality and father involvement. Findings suggest that OXTR methylation might be a biological mechanism linking social instability to father involvement among unmarried, African American fathers in vulnerable contexts and underscore the detrimental influence of childhood trauma on father involvement.

J	Sabato, H; Kogut, T				Sabato, Hagit; Kogut, Tehila			The Development of Prosociality Among Christian Arab Children in Israel: The Role of Children's Household Religiosity and of the Recipient's Neediness	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We examined the development of sharing behavior of children (aged 6 to 12) within the unique, minority population of Christian Arab children in Israel (N = 319). Children had the opportunity to share candy with a needy or non-needy recipient. Parents' level of religiosity was assessed using the Duke University Religion Index questionnaire (DUREL). Results replicate previous research that focused primarily on the majority populations of the societies in question, by demonstrating an overall increase in the incidence of sharing with age. Furthermore-as previously found among the majority of Jewish children in Israel-the recipient's neediness moderated the association between household religiosity and sharing, such that religiosity predicted greater levels of sharing only when the recipient was described as "poor" (a child whose parents have little money), not when the prospective recipient was not specified as such. Finally, the neediness of the recipient increased the incidence of sharing regardless of age, suggesting that in this unique minority population, sensitivity to the recipient's neediness emerges already at the age of 6. We discuss possible mechanisms behind this developmental pattern.

This study examined the role of the HLE of 41 whanau (New Zealand Maori families and community) in relation to their young children's (M = 4 years, 4 months) early learning skills. Parents were observed reading a picture book and reminiscing about past events with their children and reported on their cultural affiliation, literacy, and numeracy practices. Children completed vocabulary, narrative, early literacy, early numeracy, and self-regulation tasks. Principal components analyses revealed an early academic skills factor (story comprehension, story memory, phonological awareness, letter recognition, number recognition, counting, and self-regulation) and an oral language skills factor (receptive and expressive vocabulary and story comprehension). Parents' observed book reading and reminiscing correlated with children's early academic skills, and their observed book reading correlated with children's oral language skills. Parent-child reminiscing was a unique, positive predictor of children's early academic skills. Oral narratives such as reminiscing may be a less visible cultural practice that supports children's early learning. Yet reminiscing is a recognized skill within indigenous communities that have a strong emphasis of intergenerational oral transmission of culturally relevant information. Reminiscing is a source of resilience for whanau, and perhaps for other communities around the world, that needs to be highlighted and taken into account for theory and policy about children's early learning.

Yet, this prediction has not been thoroughly tested in schoolchildren's everyday lives. In this work, we examined the association between relatedness satisfaction and frustration at school on daily and average positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA) using ambulatory assessment in three intensive longitudinal studies with children aged 9-12 (total N = 317). In Study 1, 4th to 6th graders reported their PA and NA 2 times daily and their relatedness satisfaction and frustration once a day for 2 weeks. In Study 2 and Study 3, 4th graders and 5th graders, respectively, reported their PA and NA 4 times daily and their relatedness satisfaction and frustration once a day for 4 weeks. Across the 3 studies, relatedness satisfaction and frustration were psychometrically separable and exhibited differential effects such that relatedness satisfaction was significantly associated primarily with PA, and relatedness frustration was significantly associated only with NA at between- and within-person levels. Explaining interindividual differences suggested that the association between daily relatedness and affective well-being was weaker for generally highly integrated children and stronger for usually rather excluded children.

Using longitudinal data from 1652 German late adolescents, this research tested the effect of initial high-school parent, same-sex, and opposite sex self-concept and its change on university dropout intentions, study stress, and study satisfaction. High-school self-concept predicted all outcomes. Change across the postschool transition in parent and same self-concept also predicted most outcomes. Change in opposite sex self-concept predicted no outcome. We argue young people's relationship self-beliefs are critical for successful developmental transitions. Consistent with previous research, we argue that parents remain a vital relationship for late adolescents.

J	Kochanska, G; Kim, S				Kochanska, Grazyna; Kim, Sanghag			Children's Early Difficulty and Agreeableness in Adolescence: Testing a Developmental Model of Interplay of Parent and Child Effects	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Although the trait of Agreeableness is broadly considered a key facet of adjustment, mental health, and socioemotional competence, surprisingly little is known about its developmental origins. Laursen and Richmond (2014) proposed that children's early difficulty poses a challenge for their future social relationships, ultimately leading to low Agreeableness. Drawing from that model, we examined a path to Agreeableness in adolescence, originating in children's early temperamental difficulty and involving bidirectional effects of parenting and children's self-regulation. In a community sample of 102 mothers, fathers, and children, we assessed children's difficulty at age 3, and parental power-assertive discipline and children's self-regulation at ages 4.5 and 5.5, using behavioral observations in lengthy interactive contexts and in standard laboratory paradigms. Agreeableness at age 14 was modeled as a latent construct, derived from mothers', fathers', and teachers' ratings. Model-fitting analyses, testing the unfolding developmental path from child difficulty to Agreeableness while controlling for continuity of parental power assertion and child self-regulation, supported a process linking early difficulty with Agreeableness at age 14 through transactions over time between the child's self-regulation and power-assertive parenting. The findings highlight the early dynamics of children's temperament characteristics and parenting in the origins of Agreeableness.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				AUG	2020	56	8					1556	1564		10.1037/dev0001023	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0001023								32510231					WOS:000562139400012
J	Iimura, S; Kibe, C				Iimura, Shuhei; Kibe, Chieko			Highly Sensitive Adolescent Benefits in Positive School Transitions: Evidence for Vantage Sensitivity in Japanese High-Schoolers	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Some researchers indicate that the transition to high school deflects adolescent developmental trajectories. Others assert that it provides a new possibility for the promotion of adolescents' socioemotional well-being. One critical view missing in such claims is that individual variabilities interact with environmental influences. We employed the framework of Differential Susceptibility Theory, which postulates that individual susceptibilities moderate external influences for better and for worse. To clarify the mechanism of adolescents' differential adjustments, this article investigates the role of sensory-processing sensitivity using the Japanese version of Highly Sensitive Child Scale for Adolescence (J-HSCS) and tests whether the diathesis-stress model or the differential susceptibility model best describes students' socioemotional adjustment across their high school transition. The current article used the two-wave data collected from Japanese adolescents aged from 14 to 15 years (n = 412, 50% girls). In Study 1, we investigated the replicability of psychometric properties of J-HSCS. The results supported previous findings, indicating its validity for the bifactor model. In Study 2, we utilized confirmatory competitive model testing, which maximizes statistical power by parameterizing the crossover point to allow a direct comparison of alternative models. The results indicate that neither the diathesis-stress nor the differential susceptibility models fitted the data. Rather, a strong vantage sensitivity model was revealed, suggesting that highly susceptible adolescents disproportionately benefitted from a positive school transition over their counterparts. This finding signified the role of adolescents' sensitivity to environmental influences and the importance of considering its moderation under Person x Environment interactions.

Using data collected over 2 waves from a sample of 604 adolescents (Wave 1: M-age = 12.41, SD = 0.97), this study identified 4 types of bilingual language broker profiles that capture the tripartite framework of language use: efficacious, moderate, ambivalent, and nonchalant. All 4 profiles emerged across waves and brokering recipients (i.e., mothers, fathers), except for Wave 1 brokering for mother, in which case only 3 profiles (i.e., efficacious, moderate, and ambivalent) emerged. Three profiles emerged across time: stable efficacious, stable moderate, and other. The efficacious and stable efficacious profiles showed the most consistent relation to adolescents' academic competence. Improving bilingual language proficiency, together with fostering more frequently positive brokering experiences, may be an avenue to improving academic competence among Mexican-origin adolescents in the United States.

Our sample included 749 U.S. Mexican-origin youths (30% Mexico-born; 49% female), and their parents, followed for 7 years (M-age = 10.44 to 17.38 years). Linear latent growth analyses revealed that both parental enculturation and acculturation processes have important implications for U.S. Mexican-origin adolescents' bicultural competence.

Examining Changes in African American Mothers' Racial Socialization Patterns During Adolescence: Racial Discrimination as a Predictor	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Racial socialization is a culturally relevant parenting strategy known to combat the detrimental consequences of racial discrimination for African American youth. Three limitations hinder our developmental understanding of the racial socialization process. Few studies have accounted for the combination of messages that primary caregivers convey, examined how these messages change over time, or investigated how caregivers and adolescents experiences with racial discrimination predict change in the combination of messages conveyed. Given that African American mothers are often the primary socializers in families, the current study used data from a community sample of 497 African American adolescents (52% Female; Time 1 M-age = 15.69; Time 2 M-age = 18.74) and their mothers (Time 1 M-age = 40.43; Time 2 M-age = 43.39) to identify patterns in mothers' racial socialization messages, identify how mothers' racial socialization patterns change from middle to late adolescence, and investigate whether mother- and adolescent-reported racial discrimination contribute to changes in mothers' racial socialization patterns. Latent profile analysis and latent transition analysis were used to examine these questions. Findings revealed three racial socialization patterns: balanced socializers who mistrust, cultural socialization and preparation for bias emphasizers, and low racial socializers. Most mothers were in the low racial socializers group, and most provided similar messages in middle and late adolescence. Mothers' reports of their own racial discrimination influenced the racial socialization messages mothers delivered; however, adolescent-reported racial discrimination did not. These results have implications for community-based interventions designed to help families manage racial discrimination.

Kevin			Detection of Sensorimotor Contingencies in Infants Before the Age of 1 Year: A Comprehensive Review	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												To benefit from the exploration of their bodies and their physical and social environments, infants need to detect sensorimotor contingencies linking their actions to sensory feedback. This ability, which seems to be present in babies from birth and even in utero, has been widely used by researchers in their study of early development. However, a careful review of the literature, particularly the recent literature, suggests that babies may not be uniformly sensitive to all sensorimotor contingencies. This literature review examines in detail sensorimotor contingency detection in infants before the age of 1 year. Four aspects of sensorimotor contingency detection are considered: characteristics of action and feedback, contingency parameters, exposure conditions, and interindividual differences. For each topic, we highlight what favors and what hinders the detection of sensorimotor contingencies in infants. Our review also demonstrates the limitations of our knowledge about sensorimotor contingency detection. We emphasize the importance of making progress in this field at a time when sensorimotor contingency detection is of major interest in developmental robotics and artificial intelligence.

Rational-imitation accounts suggest that infants evaluate actions based on the rationality principle, that is, they expect people to choose efficient means to achieve a goal. Accordingly, infants' expectations should be violated when observing inefficient actions. However, this has yet to be clearly tested. Here, we conducted three electrophysiological experiments to assess infants' neural indices of violation of expectation (VOE) when observing hand- and head-touch actions. We presented infants with video sequences showing a model whose hands were either free (Experiments 1 and 3) or restrained (Experiment 2). Subsequent images depicted a person turning on a lamp or a toy soundbox using her hand or head. We analyzed the Negative central (Nc) component, associated with the amount of attentional engagement, and the N400 component, reflecting semantic violations. In line with rational-imitation accounts, results revealed that 12- to 14-month-olds (Experiment 1) but not 9-month-olds (Experiment 3) were surprised while observing an inefficient, hands-free, head touch, as indicated by an increased Nc amplitude and an N400-like component. In contrast, infants did not show differences in our measures of VOE between head- and hand-touch outcomes when the model's hands were restrained (Experiment 2). Thus, we suggest that 12 to 14-month-olds incorporate the action context when evaluating action outcomes.

Young Children Trust Robots Depending on Their Perceived Accuracy and Agency	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Children acquire extensive knowledge from others. Today, children receive information from not only people but also technological devices, like social robots. Two studies assessed whether young children appropriately trust technological informants. One hundred and four 3-year-olds learned the names of novel objects from either a pair of social robots or inanimate machines, where 1 informant was previously shown to be accurate and the other inaccurate. Children trusted information from an accurate social robot over an inaccurate one, as they have been shown to do for human informants, and even more so when they perceived the robots as having psychological agency. However, children did not learn selectively from inanimate, but accurate, machines. Children can learn from technological devices (e.g., social robots) but trust their information more when the device appears to have mindful agency.

Executive Functions and Young Children's Lie-Telling and Lie Maintenance	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The current study is the first to provide a comprehensive examination of the activation-decision-construction model (Walczyk, Roper, Seemann, & Humphrey, 2003, 2009) in relation to young children's lie-telling and lie maintenance. Young children (3 to 4 years of age, N = 93) completed the temptation-resistance paradigm to elicit a transgression (peeking at a forbidden toy). Children were asked if they peeked at the toy (initial lie) and what they thought the toy was (lie maintenance). A battery of executive functioning tasks was administered (working memory, inhibitory control, planning). With increased inhibitory control on a response inhibition task, children were significantly more likely to lie. With increased inhibitory control on a conflict inhibition task and superior planning on a planning task, children were significantly more likely to maintain their lies. Support for the activation-decision-construction model in relation to young children's deception is discussed.

J	Liberman, Z				Liberman, Zoe			Keep the Cat in the Bag: Children Understand That Telling a Friend's Secret Can Harm the Friendship	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Secrets play a powerful role in human social relationships. Here, we examine the developmental trajectory of 3- to 10-year-old children's (N = 630) expectations about (a) how relationships impact whether people will keep secrets, and (b) how relationships are impacted when a confidee keeps versus tells a confider's secret. Sophisticated expectations about the role of secrets in relationship maintenance develop across childhood. In particular, school-age children (6- to 10-year-olds) expect friends to be more likely to keep each other's secrets than nonfriends (Study 1), and expect that if a friend breaks this norm and shares his friend's secret with a third-party, it will harm the friendship (Studies 2 and 3). These expectations were specific to inferences about secrets: school-age children did not expect that sharing (or keeping) a friend's fact or surprise would impact the friendship strength (Studies 2 and 3). These findings did not hold for preschoolers (3- to 5-year-olds), who did not have clear expectations linking secret sharing to friendship strength. Taken together, our results indicate that by 6 years of age, children understand that social relationships can increase people's obligations to keep each other's secrets, and that failing to do so can harm the relationship.

Beyond Language: Impacts of Shared Reading on Parenting Stress and Early Parent-Child Relational Health	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examined the interrelated and longitudinal impacts of parent-child shared book reading, parenting stress, and early relational health, as measured by both parental warmth and parent sensitivity, from infancy to toddlerhood. To extend findings from previous studies of collateral effects that have been conducted in parenting interventions, we examined parenting behaviors in a broader context to determine whether shared book reading would confer collateral benefits to the parent and parent-child relationship beyond those expected (i.e., language and literacy). It was hypothesized that positive parent-child interactions, such as shared reading, would have positive impacts on parent outcomes such as parenting stress, parental warmth, and sensitivity. The sample consisted of 293 low-income mothers and their children who participated in a randomized controlled trial. Shared book reading, parenting stress, and parental warmth were assessed when children were 6 and 18 months old. We computed a series of cross-lagged structural equation models to examine longitudinal interrelations among these three factors. Results indicated that shared book reading at 6 months was associated with increases in observed and reported parental warmth and observed sensitivity and decreases in parenting stress at 18 months, controlling for baseline risk factors and treatment group status. These findings suggest that early parent-child book reading can have positive collateral impacts on parents' stress and the parent- child relationship over time.

The Curvilinear Effect of Mothers' Parenting Stress and Attunement on Children's Internalizing Symptoms: A Six Wave Study of Mother-Youth Dyads Across the Transition to Adolescence	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We aimed to test how deviations in a mother's own parenting stress (PS) levels across her child's transition to adolescence contribute to subsequent changes in her child's internalizing symptom levels. We tested both linear and curvilinear effects, as well as the extent to which a child's perception of his or her mother's attunement alters these links. We further explored whether overall maternal PS levels (relative to the other mothers) further moderate the within-dyad association. These effects were tested in a community sample consisting of 202 mother-child dyads during transition to early adolescence. The dyads were examined within and across six waves, each separated by 6 months. During each wave, the mothers (M-age at baseline = 40.1 years [SD = 6.1]) reported on their PS, while children (M-age at baseline = 10.1 years [SD = .90]) reported on their internalizing symptoms and their perceived maternal attunement. Multilevel within-dyad analyses revealed a U-shaped effect of mothers' PS on concurrent child symptoms, whereas the prospective association was not significant. Maternal attunement moderated the concurrent effects, changing the tipping point at which the concurrent potential benefits of rising PS were outweighed by the potential negative consequences of overburdening the child. Increases in PS prospectively predicted increased symptoms in the child but not when maternal attunement was above the mothers' average level. Global PS levels did not moderate these effects. The results underscore the contribution made by mothers' PS to the emotional trajectories of their children and show that these effects vary as a function of deviations in maternal attunement.

Using a subsample from the National Institute of Child Health and Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 829), we employed an autoregressive latent trajectory model with structured residuals (ALT-SR) to unpack the trait and state aspects in the relations between parental sensitivity and children's social adjustment. After taking into account trait factors, among all the significant autoregressive and cross-lagged paths originally found in the autoregressive cross-lagged panel models, less than one third of them remained significant in the ALT-SR model. More specifically, in the ALT-SR model, more parent-driven effects were observed for fathers and child-driven effects were detected between children's social skills and fathers' sensitivity. Taken together, it appears that parents' central tendency to be sensitive in the long term is a stable trait, and experiences less state-level fluctuations, and these appear to matter more for children's general tendency to show well adjustment as opposed to change over time.

Children's Attentional Biases to Emotions as Sources of Variability in Their Vulnerability to Interparental Conflict	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Little is known about the role children's processing of emotions plays in altering children's vulnerability to interparental conflict. To address this gap, the present study examined whether the mediational cascade involving children's exposure to interparental conflict, their insecure responses to interparental conflict, and their psychological problems varied as a function of children's preexisting biases to attend to angry, fearful, sad, and happy expressions. Participants included 243 children (M age = 4.60 years) and their parents assessed at 3 annual measurement occasions. Moderated-mediation analyses within a cross-lagged autoregressive design indicated that the indirect paths among interparental conflict, emotional insecurity, and psychological problems were significant for children who exhibited greater attentional biases toward angry and fearful emotions. Greater attention to anger and fear specifically moderated the first link in the mediational path. Interparental conflict was a significantly stronger predictor of emotional insecurity for children who attended to angry and fearful cues longer. Consistent with environmental sensitivity theories, children with attentional biases to angry and fearful emotions exhibited disproportionately higher levels of emotional insecurity following exposure to heightened interparental conflict but also lower levels of emotional insecurity after experiencing minimal interparental conflict.

Using longitudinal data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, we investigate associations between parenting beliefs and behaviors, child temperament, and attachment security during early childhood in relation to adult political ideology and party affiliation at age 26 years (N = 1,364). Young children's fearful temperament and anxious attachment security, as well as mothers' authoritarian parenting beliefs in early childhood, predicted conservative political orientations at age 26. Children's abilities to focus attention and avoidant attachment security predicted liberal orientations. These findings provide evidence that multiple aspects of early developmental experience-temperament, parenting, and infant-mother attachment-are associated with later political orientations.

The Longitudinal Association Between Externalizing and Internalizing Problems: An Exploration of the Dual Failure Model	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The Dual Failure Model suggests that peer victimization (social failure) and academic difficulties (academic failure) mediate the association between externalizing and later internalizing problems. The present study sought to better understand why children with externalizing problems develop later internalizing problems by testing the Dual Failure Model using a sample of 744 children (aged 6 to 10 at Time 1 [T1]), of whom 434 (44.7% girls) presented with high levels of conduct problems at study inception. Both parent and teacher ratings of externalizing and internalizing problems support the social failure pathway, but not the academic failure pathway. Children with externalizing behaviors at T1 who developed internalizing problems 2 years later did so via their experiences of peer victimization. These results apply for both boys and girls and do not vary according to child age at T1 or the level of conduct problems at study inception. These findings underscore the importance of early screening and intervention for externalizing behavioral problems in order to reduce subsequent peer victimization and internalizing problems. Findings regarding the consequences of internalizing are also discussed.

Pathological Video Game Symptoms From Adolescence to Emerging Adulthood: A 6-Year Longitudinal Study of Trajectories, Predictors, and Outcomes	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The aim of this study was to examine trajectories of pathological video game symptoms over a 6-year period from adolescence to emerging adulthood. We also examined a number of predictors and outcomes for different trajectories. Participants included 385 adolescents (M age = 15.01 at the initial time point) who completed multiple questionnaires once a year over a 6-year period. Analyses showed there were 3 distinct trajectories. Approximately 10% of adolescents (called "increasing symptoms") showed moderate levels of pathological gaming symptoms at the initial time point and then increases in symptoms over time. Conversely, 18% of adolescents (called "moderate symptoms") started with moderate symptoms that did not change over time. Finally, 72% of adolescents (called "nonpathological") were relatively low in symptoms across the 6 years of data collection. Being male predicted both the increasing and moderate groups. The increasing group tended to show the worst outcomes over time, with higher levels of depression, aggression, shyness, problematic cell phone use, and anxiety than the nonpathological group, even when controlling for initial levels of many of these variables.

Chinese early adolescents of immigrant background (n = 123) and Italian mainstreamers (n = 187) aged between 11 and 13 years participated in the Semantic Misattribution Procedure and completed a set of questionnaires. Results indicated that at the implicit level, Chinese-origin youths reported higher interdependence than their Italian nonimmigrant peers, whereas at the explicit level, Italian youths scored higher on independence than their Chinese counterparts. In both ethnocultural groups, independent SC (implicit and explicit) was positively related to self-esteem, whereas interdependent SC (implicit and explicit) was positively linked to prosocial behavior. Findings underscore the usefulness of integrating implicit and explicit measures to evaluate early adolescents' SCs in multicultural contexts.

Racial Discrimination Trajectories Predicting Psychological Well-Being: From Emerging Adulthood to Adulthood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Perceived racial discrimination (PRD) has been documented as a risk factor for worse psychological well-being among African Americans. Yet, most researchers have not examined how trajectories of PRD during emerging adulthood shape psychological well-being in adulthood. Moreover, less is known about whether demographic factors and components of racial identity shape PRD over time. We identified trajectories of PRD among 605 African American emerging adults and examined whether PRD trajectories were associated with depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and perceived lack of control in adulthood. Four trajectories of PRD were identified (i.e., high-stable, moderate-declining, low-rising, and low-stable), and demographic factors and racial identity indicators influenced the likelihood of trajectory classification. In addition, members of the moderate-declining trajectory exhibited higher levels of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and perceived lack of control than members in the low-stable trajectory. Our findings suggest that changes in PRD in emerging adulthood can extend our understanding of psychological well-being in adulthood.

J	Gonzalez, G; Blake, PR; Dunham, Y; McAuliffe, K				Gonzalez, Gorana; Blake, Peter R.; Dunham, Yarrow; McAuliffe, Katherine			Ingroup Bias Does Not Influence Inequity Aversion in Children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Ingroup favoritism influences third-party norm enforcement: Third-party punishers are more lenient when an ingroup member has been unfair. By contrast, in 2-party contexts, where punishers are the victims of unfairness, group bias effects are absent or inconsistent. Thus, group bias appears to be particularly influential when enforcing fairness among others, but less so when protecting oneself from unfairness. This would have implications for theories of how cooperation and intergroup cognition interact, but a more direct empirical test is lacking. To this end, developmental data are particularly useful as they can tell us whether and if so how group bias and fairness norm enforcement are related from their first emergence. Using a minimal groups manipulation, we induced ingroup bias in 6- to 9-year-olds and tested their willingness to reject disadvantageous (more for you) and advantageous (more for me) resource allocations when paired with in- and outgroup members. Group bias did not affect children's rejections of unfair allocations, although they reported that it was worse when an outgroup member had more. Our findings suggest that ingroup bias does not influence children's costly endorsement of equality, indicating that children perceive the equality norm to be indiscriminate and enforceable across group boundaries.

Observational results from 562 families suggest that caregivers and children in Parkopolis demonstrated greater STEM language, engagement, interaction, and physical activity compared to a STEM focused traditional children's museum exhibit.

Preschoolers Use Helpful and Harmful Interactions to Predict Social Category Membership	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												A core question in social categorization research focuses on how children organize social categories. We examined whether 4- and 5-year-olds: (a) identify the social category membership of a person based on relational interactions between that person and a known category member; and (b) use these social categories to guide inferences about certain shared properties. Preschoolers (n = 229) were introduced to 2 novel social categories (comprised of diverse individuals), each possessing a distinct property (e.g., dancing vs. singing). During test trials, children witnessed members from each category direct helpful, harmful, or neutral actions toward ambiguous characters. In Experiment 1, when a member of a category exhibited helpful actions toward an ambiguous character, children inferred that the ambiguous character belonged to the same category as the helper. In contrast, when a group member directed harmful actions toward the ambiguous character, children inferred that ambiguous character belonged to the alternate category. In neither case did children extend category properties to the new member. In Experiment 2, category properties were introduced as mutually exclusive social conventions. Here, children used helpful and harmful actions to identify the social category of an ambiguous character and generalize the property. In Experiment 3, when social categories were introduced using only shared physical location and shared activity as a marker of category membership, children did not use helpful or harmful behavior to predict category membership. Together findings indicate that children can identify social category membership based on observed social interactions when meaningful category information is available.

Promoting Honesty Through Overheard Conversations	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Although there is widespread acknowledgment that children acquire social and moral values during development via socialization processes, few plausible mechanisms have been systematically evaluated. In the present research, we examine the effectiveness of 1 potential mechanism: overheard conversations about the moral behavior of others. We examine this issue with reference to the important social value of honesty. Across 3 preregistered studies, preschool-age children in China (total N = 276) were presented with a version of the temptation resistance paradigm in which they were first given an opportunity to cheat by peeking at the answer in a guessing game and were then asked whether they had cheated. Study 1 included both 3- and 5-year-olds, and Studies 2 and 3 included 5-year-olds only. In Study 1 children were more likely to truthfully confess to peeking if they had previously overheard 2 adults say that another child's confession made them happy. An increase in truthful confessions was also seen in Study 2, even though this time the adult who asked about peeking had not been present for the overheard conversation. In Study 3, children were presented with an overheard conversation that lacked any emotion-related language, and the effect was seen once again. Taken together, these findings suggest that overheard conversations can be used to promote truth telling. More broadly, the findings suggest that children realize the attitudes adults express about others can have implications for their own behavior and can identify these attitudes, even when they are not the target of the communication.

Youth (N = 1,269) reported on their teen stereotypes and problem behavior in the fall and spring of 7th grade. Youth in Hong Kong (vs. Chongqing) saw adolescence as a time of dampened family obligation as well as heightened individuation from parents, disengagement from school, and orientation toward peers. The tendency for youth in Hong Kong (vs. Chongqing) to see teens as less obligated to their family and more disengaged from school undergirded their greater problem behavior over the 7th grade, with problem behavior appearing to contribute to the maintenance of the two stereotypes.

Choosing Immediate Over Delayed Gratification Correlates With Better School-Related Outcomes in a Sample of Children of Color From Low-Income Families	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Delayed, as opposed to immediate, gratification is generally understood to indicate adaptive development. The present study investigates performance on a choice-based delay of gratification measure and its relations with other outcomes in a sample of children of color from low-income families, who are underrepresented in delayed gratification research. The 6-item choice delay of gratification task, administered at the start of kindergarten (M-age = 5.5 years), exhibited good reliability. Items were largely equal in difficulty, but not equally discriminant. Children who chose immediate gratification had better executive function and were rated higher than their peers by their kindergarten teachers on behavioral measures; patterns in relations with first grade classroom behavior were similar, but weaker and not robust to controls. Choosing immediate gratification was also positively related to concurrent and later achievement, but not after controlling for executive function. These observations reinforce a need to clarify constructs underlying delay of gratification choices within groups of children underrepresented in this line of research.

J	Lobo, FM; Lunkenheimer, E				Lobo, Frances M.; Lunkenheimer, Erika			Understanding the Parent-Child Coregulation Patterns Shaping Child Self-Regulation	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Parent-child coregulation, thought to support children's burgeoning regulatory capacities, is the process by which parents and their children regulate one another through their goal-oriented behavior and expressed affect. Two particular coregulation patterns-dyadic contingency and dyadic flexibility-appear beneficial in early childhood, but their role in the typical development of self-regulation is not yet clear. The present study examined whether dynamic parent-child patterns of dyadic contingency and dyadic flexibility in both affect and goal-oriented behavior (e.g., discipline, compliance) predicted multiple components of preschoolers' self-regulation. Mother-child dyads (N = 100) completed structured and unstructured dyadic tasks in the laboratory at age 3, and mothers completed child self-regulation measures at age 4. Findings showed that more flexible and contingent affective parent-child processes, as long as the affective content was primarily positive or neutral, predicted higher levels of self-regulation in early childhood. However, when dyads engaged in more negative affective and behavioral content, higher levels of affective and behavioral contingency and behavioral flexibility predicted lower levels of child self-regulation. Findings suggest parent-child coregulation processes play a meaningful role in children's typical regulatory development and that parent-child coregulation patterns can be potentially adaptive or maladaptive for child outcomes depending on the content of the interaction.

In the studies, the experimenter induced gratitude by giving a token gift and then making a request for help or to share resources. Experiment 1 (N = 126, 4- to 6-year-olds) showed that gratitude increased helping behaviors toward the benefactor, and that emphasis on the benefactor's intention had a significant effect on helping behaviors. Experiment 2 (N = 129, 4- to 6-year-olds) indicated that grateful emotions increased the likelihood that the children would help not only the benefactor but also a stranger. Experiment 3 (N = 133, 3- to 6-year-olds) showed that gratitude motivated preschoolers' sharing behavior with the benefactor. Children's theory-of-mind and their understanding of the benefactor's intention mediated the relationship between children's age, gratitude, and prosociality.

J	Grueneisen, S; Tomasello, M				Grueneisen, Sebastian; Tomasello, Michael			The Development of Coordination via Joint Expectations for Shared Benefits	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												People frequently need to cooperate despite having strong self-serving motives. In the current study, pairs of 5- and 7-year-olds (N = 160) faced a one-shot coordination problem: To benefit, children had to choose the same of 3 reward divisions. They could not communicate or see each other and thus had to accurately predict each other's choices to succeed. One division split the rewards evenly, while the others each favored one child. Five-year-olds mostly chose the division favorable to themselves, resulting in coordination failure. By contrast, 7-year-olds mostly coordinated successfully by choosing the division that split the rewards equally (even though they behaved selfishly in a control condition in which they could choose independently). This suggests that by age 7, children jointly expect benefits to be shared among interdependent social partners "fairly" and that fair compromises can emanate from a cooperative rationality adapted for social coordination.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				JUN	2020	56	6					1149	1156		10.1037/dev0000936	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000936								32338934					WOS:000531867900009

Does Gender-Bending Help or Hinder Friending? The Roles of Gender and Gender Similarity in Friendship Dissolution	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We explored how gender and gender similarity affects friendship dissolution following the transition to middle school. We predicted that both gender and gender similarity (measured by perceived similarity to own-gender and other-gender peers) explain dissolution trends and that less own-gender similarity or more other-gender similarity predicts more friendship dissolution. We considered gender and gender similarity at both the individual and dyad level (reflecting the discrepancy between friends). Participants were 198 students in Grade 6 (42% Latinx, 21% Caucasian, 10% Native American, 8% African American, 2% Asian American, and 17% mixed backgrounds; 77% qualified for free/reduced meals) in reciprocated same- or mixed-gender friendships followed from fall to spring of the academic year. Multilevel multimember logistic regression models, nesting friendships within each participating individual, demonstrated that girl-girl friendships were less likely to dissolve than boy-boy friendships, and mixed-gender friendships did not dissolve more than same-gender friendships. Feeling similar to one's own gender predicted less dissolution, but feeling similar to the other gender did not increase friendship dissolution. There was no support for the hypothesis that feeling similar to both genders (i.e., androgyny) protected against friendship dissolution, nor was there any support for the hypothesis that dyad-level differences in gender similarity would predict dissolution. The discussion focuses on the importance of conducting individual and dyad-level analyses as well as including gender similarity constructs when studying gender differences in friendships and their trajectories over time.

It is unclear, however, whether one emotion evokes an enhanced response across components, and whether this pattern differs based on parent status or other sample characteristics. This meta-analysis quantified adult responses to child emotional expressions at the N170 and the late positive potential (LPP) components. Cohen's d reflected the difference between crying and neutral (CN), crying and laughing (CL), and laughing and neutral (LN) N170 and LPP amplitudes. Crying expressions elicited slightly enhanced N170 and LPP amplitudes relative to neutral and laughing expressions (N170 CN: k = 24, d = -0.09, p < 0.001; N170 CL: k= 30, d = -0.07, p = .004; LPP CN: k = 20, d = 0.12, p = .027; LPP CL: k = 27, d = 0.10, p < .001), and laughing expressions elicited slightly enhanced N170 amplitudes relative to neutral expressions (N170 LN: k = 21, d = -0.05, p = .02). Parental status, child age, risk factors for insensitive caregiving, and measurement characteristics moderated some effect sizes, with reference electrode emerging as the most consistent moderator. Results shed light on the typical pattern of neural response to child emotions and characteristics that may moderate this response.

A Contextual View on Parental Reflective Functioning and Mind-Mindedness	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Parental mentalization refers to parents' capacity to treat their children as having minds of their own and consider the mental states underlying their behaviors. This study examined the roles of mothers' executive functions (EFs), a group of processes supporting self-regulation, in 2 aspects of parental mentalization-spontaneity as measured by mind-mindedness (MM), and complexity as measured by parental reflective functioning (PRF)-while examining child- and family related contextual-moderators. Ninety-nine mothers of 66-month-old preschool children (40 full-term, 59 preterm) completed EFs tasks, were interviewed regarding their child and coparenting, and rated their perception of their child as being difficult (i.e., difficult behavior and negative emotionality). EFs were unrelated to MM. However, EFs were related to PRF when children were rated as more difficult, and when mothers reported high coparenting dissatisfaction; moreover, EFs and PRF were associated among mothers of full-term children, but not in the preterm group. Findings indicate that EFs contribute to the complexity and coherence of maternal mentalization, especially in contexts in which regulation is required for being able to consider the child's mind (difficult child, coparenting dissatisfaction), but not in stressful contexts that are likely to elicit automaticity (prematurity). EFs, however, do not seem to contribute to spontaneous attribution of mental states to the child, when complexity is not considered.

Development of Youth Advocacy and Sociopolitical Efficacy as Dimensions of Critical Consciousness Within Gender-Sexuality Alliances	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Attention to youth advocacy and sociopolitical efficacy has been evident in developmental research on critical consciousness, yet this literature has given little attention to sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth or issues, or to the interplay between these dimensions of critical consciousness over time. We addressed these limitations within the context of gender-sexuality alliances (GSAs). Among 366 youth members (M-age = 15.53 years) in 38 GSAs across Massachusetts who completed surveys at the beginning and end of the school year, multilevel models indicated that youth who reported more active engagement in GSAs at the beginning of the school year reported greater advocacy throughout the year and greater sociopolitical efficacy at the year's end (adjusting for baseline advocacy and efficacy). There was a significant indirect association between greater GSA engagement and greater sociopolitical efficacy at the year's end through reported advocacy done over the school year. Furthermore, group-level contextual effects indicated that youth in GSAs with a more youth-led orientation reported doing less advocacy but reported greater sociopolitical efficacy at the year's end than youth in GSAs with less of a youth-led orientation. Finally, advocacy and sociopolitical efficacy were reciprocally associated with one another: Greater initial efficacy was associated with greater advocacy over the school year, and advocacy was associated with greater efficacy at the year's end. These findings extend the critical consciousness literature and carry implications for how GSAs and similar groups could support SGM youth and their allies in resisting oppression.						Poteat, V.

Subjective social status (SSS) refers to one's perception of standing or rank relative to others, and for youth status is generally in the context of society or school. The current study assessed how adolescents' SSS in American society and in their school changes and predicts health and well-being during and after high school. A total of 336 adolescents (M-age = 16.40 at Wave 1) reported their SSS at up to three time points, each 2 years apart, such that youth provided data between the 10th grade and 3 years following the transition from high school. Piecewise multilevel modeling was used, including discontinuities to assess the importance of the transition from high school. Society SSS decreased across the period, especially among youth with lower family income, youth whose parents reported lower SSS, and youth who did not attend college. School SSS was stable during high school, declined after 12th grade, and remained stable thereafter. Moderation analyses revealed that school SSS declines more consistently among female adolescents than male adolescents and Latinos relative to other ethnic groups. Lower society and school SSS were associated with more depressive symptoms and greater likelihood of obesity, highlighting the relevance of SSS for health during this important developmental transition. Results suggest declines in SSS are especially common among disadvantaged groups as they age, and that lower SSS may indicate risk for poorer health.

More Data, More Problems: Analytical Complications of Studying Differential Family Experiences Over Time: Reply to Laird (2020)	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The use of differences scores to assess agreement/disagreement has a long and contentious history. Laird (2020) notes, however, that developmentalists have been particularly resistant to discontinue the use of difference scores. One area of developmental science where difference scores are still in regular use is that of parental differential treatment (PDT) or sibling differential experiences. In this response we argue that, in the case of our particular article (Campione-Barr, Lindell, & Giron, 2020), while the use of difference scores may not have been ideal, they were utilized for several reasons, including the history of the field in operationally defining within-family differential experiences through the use of discrepancy scores, as well as the complicated analytical nature of research examining more than one dyad within the same family. A discussion of whether or not analytical strategies need to change in this literature is important for the field to move forward.

Beyond the Cross-Lagged Panel Model	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Prior nonexperimental studies have been used to conclude that children's reading and mathematics achievement bidirectionally influence each other over time, with strong paths from (a) early reading to later mathematics and (b) early mathematics to later reading. In the most influential study on the topic, the early math-to-later-reading path was reported to be stronger than the early reading-to-later-math path (Duncan et al., 2007). Yet prior estimates may be confounded by stable environmental and personal factors influencing both reading and mathematics achievement. We reexamined the bidirectional relations between reading and mathematics achievement using both traditional models and extensions intended to account for unmeasured confounding. Results based on a large nationally representative sample of children from kindergarten to 3rd grade (N = 9,612) indicated that the estimated effects between reading and mathematics achievement differ substantially after accounting for the confounding effects of stable unmeasured factors. In these models, autoregressive and cross-lagged paths were substantially reduced. The finding that early mathematics predicts later reading more strongly than early reading predicts later math disappears and sometimes reverses, suggesting that larger paths from math to reading than from reading to math in previous related analyses are not causally informative. Stability in early mathematics and reading achievement resulted from substantially overlapping time invariant factors that correlate above.90.

Familiar Songs Reduce Infant Distress	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Parents commonly vocalize to infants to mitigate their distress, especially when holding them is not possible. Here we examined the relative efficacy of parents' speech and singing (familiar and unfamiliar songs) in alleviating the distress of 8- and 10-month-old infants (n = 68 per age group). Parent-infant dyads participated in 3 trials of the Still Face procedure, featuring a 2-min Play Phase, a Still Face phase (parents immobile and unresponsive for 1 min or until infants became visibly distressed), and a 2-min Reunion Phase in which caregivers attempted to reverse infant distress by (a) singing a highly familiar song, (b) singing an unfamiliar song, or (c) expressive talking (order counterbalanced across dyads). In the Reunion Phase, talking led to increased negative affect in both age groups, in contrast to singing familiar or unfamiliar songs, which increased infant attention to parent and decreased negative affect. The favorable consequences were greatest for familiar songs, which also generated increased smiling. Skin conductance recorded from a subset of infants (n = 36 younger, 41 older infants) revealed that arousal levels were highest for the talking reunion, lowest for unfamiliar songs, and intermediate for familiar songs. The arousal effects, considered in conjunction with the behavioral effects, confirm that songs are more effective than speech at mitigating infant distress. We suggest, moreover, that familiar songs generate higher infant arousal than unfamiliar songs because they evoke excitement, reflected in modestly elevated arousal as well as pleasure, in contrast to more subdued responses to unfamiliar songs.

It Takes Two: Infants' Moderate Negative Reactivity and Maternal Sensitivity Predict Self-Regulation in the Preschool Years	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The aim of this longitudinal study was to examine the association of infant fussing and crying with self-regulation in toddlerhood and the preschool years, as well as the moderating role of maternal sensitivity therein. When children (n = 149, 53.69% boys) were 6 months old, parents reported on their fussing and crying using a cry diary, and maternal sensitivity was coded during a novel toy procedure. Children participated in various tasks to assess self-regulation in toddlerhood (18 months) and the preschool years (4.5 years). Results indicated that the relation between infant fussing and preschool self-regulation took the shape of an inverted U, but only for children of highly sensitive mothers. For infants of less sensitive mothers, fussing was not related to later self-regulation. Crying was unrelated to preschool self-regulation. Neither fussing, crying, nor maternal sensitivity predicted self-regulation in toddlerhood. The findings support the optimal arousal theory, by demonstrating that for infants of highly sensitive mothers, moderate amounts of low intensity negative reactivity are associated with enhanced self-regulation in the preschool years.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				MAY	2020	56	5					869	879		10.1037/dev0000921	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000921								32191053					WOS:000525396600002

Preschoolers Appreciate the Link Between Ownership and Knowledge	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We investigated 4- and 5-year-olds' (N = 194) appreciation of the link between knowledge and ownership. Namely, we asked whether preschoolers appreciate the ways in which owners are typically knowledgeable about artifacts. Experiment 1 revealed that 4- and 5-year-olds view owners as better sources of knowledge about artifacts than those who simply like artifacts. Experiment 2 built on these findings by showing that 5-year-olds appreciate that owners typically have deep knowledge about artifacts and that they can use this appreciation to guide inferences about who owns what. These experiments are some of the first to investigate how children's inferences about knowledge and ownership are intertwined. As such, they have implications for our understanding of early childhood cognition. First, they provide insights into how object-person relations influence judgments of expertise. Second, they extend current understandings of ownership by demonstrating that ownership influences preschoolers' reasoning in other domains (i.e., knowledge) and by showing that preschoolers' theories of ownership extend beyond normative considerations (i.e., ownership rights).

Comparatively few studies have investigated social-interactional processes in bilingual populations. Here, we investigated whether monolingual and bilingual children demonstrate similar susceptibility to an aspect of social functioning with broad societal reach: racial bias. We measured both implicit and explicit biases against African race individuals in 2 groups of monolingual preschoolers (native speakers of English or Chinese) and in 2 groups of English-Chinese bilingual preschoolers (tested in English or Chinese; total N = 160). We found that monolingual children demonstrated greater implicit bias against African race individuals than bilingual children, independent of their native language. Monolingual Chinese children demonstrated greater explicit bias than bilingual children, although monolingual English children's explicit bias scores did not differ from those of bilingual children. Findings are discussed in terms of cognitive and experiential mechanisms that may link bilingualism and racial bias.					qian, miao/AAB-4654-2019	Singh, Leher/0000-0001-9423-4956; Qian, Miao/0000-0002-6838-1407													0012-1649	1939-0599				MAY	2020	56	5					888	896		10.1037/dev0000905	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000905								31999181					WOS:000525396600004

Children Show Selectively Increased Language Imitation After Experiencing Ostracism	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												When threatened with ostracism, children attempt to strengthen social relationships by engaging in affiliative behaviors such as imitation. We investigated whether an experience of ostracism influenced the extent to which children imitated a partner's language use. In two experiments, 7- to 12-year-old children either experienced ostracism or did not experience ostracism in a virtual ball-throwing game before playing a picture-matching game with a partner. We measured children's tendency to imitate, or align with, their partner's language choices during the picture-matching game. Children showed a strong tendency to spontaneously align with their partner's lexical and grammatical choices. Crucially, their likelihood of lexical alignment was modulated by whether they had experienced ostracism. We found no effect of ostracism on syntactic alignment. These findings offer the first demonstration that ostracism selectively influences children's language use. They highlight the role of social-affective factors in children's communicative development, and show that the link between ostracism and imitation is broadly based, and extends beyond motor behaviors to the domain of language.

However, to date, there are no empirical studies addressing its development across primary school age. The present study investigated the growth of academic vocabulary and influential conditions from Grades 2 to 4 based on a newly developed and validated test instrument. Drawing on a German sample of 472 children (N = 281 language minority learners) we found evidence of a Matthew effect with the group of language minority learners showing both lower initial level and lower growth rates compared to their monolingual peers. In addition, results of simple and full conditional growth curve models underline the significant impact of family background (parental education, books at home) and of children's nonverbal cognitive abilities on the intercept as well as the growth of academic vocabulary, thereby supporting the assumption of an additional Matthew effect according to family background, particularly in monolingual majority language children. Our results indicate the need for an early promotion of the register of academic language in monolingual as well as language minority students.

Understanding How and Why Effortful Control Moderates Children's Vulnerability to Interparental Conflict	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examined the moderating role of effortful control in the association between interparental conflict and externalizing problems in a diverse sample of preschool children (N = 243; M age = 4.60 years). Using a multimethod, multi-informant, prospective design, findings indicated that the relation between interparental conflict and externalizing problems was only significant among children with poor effortful control. Children with high effortful control appeared to be protected against the negative effects of interparental conflict exhibiting low levels of externalizing problems despite increasing levels of interparental conflict. Toward identifying the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of effortful control, mediated moderation analyses indicated that children's effortful control protects children against interparental conflict by reducing their angry reactivity to interparental conflict.

Developmental Changes in Parental Authority Legitimacy and Over-Time Associations With Adjustment: Differences in Parent, First-Born, and Second-Born Perspectives	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Discrepancies in first- (M = 14.97 years, SD = 1.82) and second-born adolescents' (M = 12.20 years, SD = 1.90 years) and their parents' perceptions of parental authority legitimacy (PAL) were examined in a longitudinal sample of 145 predominantly White, middle-class, U.S. families. Utilizing a growth curve modeling approach, changes in the discrepancies between parents' and both first- and second-born adolescents' ratings of PAL over the course of 4 years were examined separately by the social- cognitive domain of the issues (social domain theory; Smetana, 2011; Turiel, 2002). We found that discrepancies between parents and first-borns increased over time for personal and multifaceted issues, whereas discrepancies for second-born adolescents increased over socially regulated issues. Additionally, larger initial discrepancies between parents and both adolescents over socially regulated issues (i.e., moral and conventional) were associated with greater depressive symptoms, while decreases in discrepancies over time were generally associated with better adjustment outcomes but with some domain and birth order differentiation. Discussion focuses on the developmental appropriateness (or inappropriateness) of family member perception differences in authority legitimacy over the course of adolescence.

Discrimination and Ethnic Identity: Establishing Directionality Among Latino/a Youth	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Ethnic identity is a consistent predictor of positive youth adjustment, whereas discrimination has been associated with negative outcomes among Latino/a youth. Scholars have proposed associations between ethnic identity and discrimination; however, directionality of effects remains unclear. Addressing this gap, the current study examined the directional relationship between ethnic identity and discrimination and their effects on psychosocial functioning utilizing a random-intercept cross-lagged model spanning 3 waves of data among 1,613 Latino/a adolescents (M-age = 13.99, SD=.40 at baseline; 51.2% female). Results support a bidirectional association between ethnic identity and discrimination. Specifically, adolescents who reported higher levels of perceived discrimination reported higher levels of ethnic identity exploration 1 year later. Further, higher levels of ethnic identity belonging predicted more reported discrimination 1 year later. No differences in the longitudinal associations between ethnic identity and discrimination were found based on generational status. More experiences of discrimination were also associated with more alcohol and cigarette use and more depressive symptoms. Additionally, ethnic identity belonging was indirectly associated with increased substance use and depressive symptoms via elevated discrimination experiences. Implications for promoting coping strategies for perceived discrimination in efforts to promote ethnic identity are discussed.

Mexican-Origin Family Members' Unique and Shared Family Perspectives of Familism Values and Their Links With Parent-Youth Relationship Quality	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												To advance understanding of parents' and adolescents' unique and shared perspectives of familism, a core cultural value in Mexican-origin families, our study addressed 2 goals. First, we identified family members' unique and shared perspectives of familism values using multitrait-multimethod confirmatory factor analysis (Kenny & Kashy, 1992). Second, we examined links between family members' unique and shared perspectives of familism values and mother-youth and father-youth warmth and conflict. Participants were mothers, fathers, and 2 siblings (M-age = 15.48 years for older and M-age = 12.55 years for younger siblings) from 246 Mexican-origin families who were interviewed in their homes on 2 occasions over 5 years. Results indicated that familism values operated as an individual-level process more so than a family-level process and that youth's familism values were most consistently linked to parent-youth relationship quality. These findings provide novel insights into investigating family system dynamics involving familism values, suggest that youth's familism values may keep them connected to their families during adolescence, and highlight potential implications for prevention and intervention programs geared toward Mexican-origin families.

Results of analyses using the developmental equilibrium model (i.e., an autoregressive, cross-lagged panel model) demonstrate a reciprocal positive association between PIU and mental health issues consistently across waves. In contrast, results of analyses utilizing the random intercept, cross-lagged panel model (i.e., a model that can disaggregate within-person and between-person effects) indicate a unidirectional positive within-person effect from PIU to mental health issues (rather than the reverse) consistently over time, while controlling for the between-person effects that exist when comparing different individuals. Such findings highlight the importance of disaggregating within-person and between-person effects in understanding the nature of the temporal dynamics of the association between PIU and mental health.

Codevelopment of Romantic Partners in Continuing and Dissolving Unions	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Do patterns of intimate relationship development foreshadow whether couples' unions stay together or end in separation? Integrating tenets from the enduring dynamics and emergent distress models of relationship development, we propose an accumulating distress model suggesting that the trajectories of those in dissolving partnerships (i.e., unions that ultimately end) are characterized by higher base levels of distress that increase more rapidly over time compared to those in continuing partnerships. In addition, we propose that this pattern applies to codevelopment between partners: those in dissolving unions are expected to have higher base dissimilarity that increases more rapidly over time compared to continuing couples. We further test whether the proposed patterns of codevelopment are equally apparent in young and middle adult couples. To test this model, we draw on data from 1,965 couples from 2 age groups in the German Family Panel study surveyed annually 7 times. Results support the concept of accumulating distress in the trajectories of relationship satisfaction, commitment, and conflict. For codevelopment, increasing dissimilarity in dissolving couples emerged for connectedness and autonomy in the relationship. In addition, dissolving partners became more similar in their low degree of commitment to the relationship. Age-related analyses broadly replicated the pattern of accumulating distress in young and middle adult couples with few exceptions for young adult women. In sum, in accordance with an accumulating distress concept of relationship codevelopment, our results revealed higher base and increasing levels of distress and dissimilarity across time among partners in dissolving unions compared to continuing couples.

The Two Faces of Ageism	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Ageism is the most prevalent form of prejudice and is experienced by both older and younger people. Little is known about whether these experiences are interdependent or have common origins. We analyze data from 8,117 older (aged 70 and over) and 11,647 younger respondents (15-29 years) in representative samples from 29 countries in the European Social Survey. Using multilevel structural equation modeling, we test the hypothesis that older people are less likely, and younger people more likely, to suffer age discrimination if they live in a country with stronger structural support for older people. We also test the hypothesis that although stronger social norm against age discrimination reduce age discrimination suffered by older people it does not inhibit discrimination against younger people. These hypotheses are supported, and the results underline the neglected problem of ageism toward youth. Findings highlight that strategies for reducing age prejudice must address ageism as a multigenerational challenge, requiring attention to intergenerational cohesion and resource distribution between ages.

We examined developmental patterns of children's resting RSA and RSA reactivity from 2 to 15 years of age, a period of time that is marked by considerable advances in children's regulatory abilities. Physiological data were collected from a community sample of 270 children (116 males) during a resting period and during a frustration laboratory task when the children were 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, and 15 years old. We examined both stability and continuity in resting RSA and RSA reactivity across time. We found stability in resting RSA but not RSA reactivity from toddlerhood to adolescence. Separate multilevel models were used to examine changes in resting RSA and RSA reactivity from Age 2 to Age 15. The rate of change in resting RSA slowed from Age 2 to Age 15 with a plateau around Age 10. A splined growth model indicated that the rate of RSA reactivity increased from Age 2 to Age 7 and a modest slowing and leveling off from Age 7 to Age 15. Understanding the developmental characteristics of RSA across childhood and adolescence is important to understanding the larger constructs of self- and emotion regulation.

Superordinate Categorization of Negative Facial Expressions in Infancy: The Influence of Labels	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Accurate perception of emotional (facial) expressions is an essential social skill. It is currently debated whether emotion categorization in infancy emerges in a "broad-to-narrow" pattern and the degree to which language influences this process. We used an habituation paradigm to explore (a) whether 14- and 18-month-old infants perceive different facial expressions (anger, sad, disgust) as belonging to a superordinate category of negative valence and (b) how verbal labels influence emotion category formation. Results indicated that infants did not spontaneously form a superordinate category of negative valence (Experiments 1 and 3). However, when a novel label ("toma") was added to each event during habituation trials (Experiments 2 and 4), infants formed this superordinate valance category when habituated to disgust and sad expressions (but not when habituated to anger and sadness). These labeling effects were obtained with two stimuli sets (Radboud Face Database and NimStim), even when controlling for the presence of teeth in the expressions. The results indicate that infants, at 14 and 18 months of age, show limited superordinate categorization based on the valence of different negative facial expressions. Specifically, infants only form this abstract emotion category when labels were provided, and the labeling effect depends on which emotions are presented during habituation. These findings have important implications for developmental theories of emotion.

The current study tested (a) whether spatial training benefited preschoolers' spatial and mathematics skills, (b) if the type of feedback provided during spatial training differentially influenced children's spatial and mathematics skills, and (c) if the spatial training's effects varied by socioeconomic status (SES). Preschoolers (N = 187) were randomly assigned to either a 'business-as-usual' control or one of three spatial training groups (modeling and feedback [MF]; gesture feedback [GF]; spatial language feedback [SLF]). Three-year-olds were trained to construct puzzles to match a model composed of various geometric shapes. New models were created similar to the 2-dimensional trials of the Test of Spatial Assembly (TOSA). Training was given once per week for 5 weeks. Preschoolers were pretested and posttested on 2D and 3D TOSA trials, spatial vocabulary, shape identification, and 2 mathematics assessments. Results indicate that first, any spatial training improved preschoolers' 2D TOSA performance, although a significant interaction with SES indicated improvement was driven by low-SES children. Furthermore, low-SES children showed greatest gains on the 2D TOSA with MF and GF. Second, MF and GF improved low-SES children's performance on the 3D TOSA. Third, only low-SES children with MF saw improvements in far-transfer to mathematics (Woodcock-Johnson: Applied Problems, but not the Test of Early Mathematical Ability). Results indicate that, especially for low-income learners, spatial training can improve children's early spatial and mathematics skills.

Preschool Language Ability Is Predicted by Toddler Hand Preference Trajectories	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Prior work has found links between consistency in toddler handedness for the fine motor skill role-differentiated bimanual manipulation (RDBM), and language development at 2 and 3 years of age. The current study investigated whether consistency in handedness from 18 to 24 months (N = 90) for RDBM predicts receptive and expressive language abilities assessed using the Preschool Language Scales 5th edition (PLS-5) at 5 years old. Latent class growth analyses identified 3 stable RDBM hand preference trajectories: a left hand preference with moderate right hand use (left-moderate right), a right hand preference with moderate left hand use (right-moderate left), and a right hand preference with only mild left hand use (right-mild left). At 5 years of age, children with a right-mild left handedness trajectory as toddlers scored significantly higher on receptive and expressive language abilities compared to children with a left-moderate right hand preference. Children with a right-mild left hand preference for RDBM also scored significantly higher on receptive language abilities compared to children with a right-moderate left RDBM hand preference. Children with left-moderate right and children with a right-moderate left hand preference for RDBM as toddlers did not differ in receptive or expressive language abilities at 5 years. Results indicate that individual differences in hand preference consistency for fine motor skill in toddlerhood have cascading effects on language outcomes into the preschool years.

Yet, interventions that try to enhance parental engagement-sometimes targeted to families with low levels of education-have small effects. This study aimed to inform supports for families by examining how different types of home-based learning activities influence academic skills during prekindergarten. We created four measures that assessed the frequency with which parents (N = 307) engaged in unconstrained and constrained language/literacy and math activities at home. Unconstrained language activities predicted gains in children's language skills, and unconstrained math activities were associated with gains in math skills. Both associations were larger for families with lower versus higher levels of parental education. Engagement in constrained activities did not predict gains in skills.

Yet, few researchers have examined the unique role of family-level factors (socioeconomic status [SES], household chaos) on children's learning or focused on the longitudinal processes that might explain their relations to children's early language skills. The goal of this study was to investigate the longitudinal relations from family SES, household chaos, and children's effortful control (EC) to children's language skills during early childhood, controlling for stability of the constructs. At Time (T1 i.e., 30 months), mothers reported family SES and children's vocabulary, and their own linguistic input was assessed during a free-play session with their child. At T1, T2 (i.e., 42 months), and T3 (i.e., 54 months), household chaos was reported by mothers, and children's EC was rated by mothers and nonparental caregivers and observed during a gift-delay task. At T3, children's expressive and receptive language skills were measured with a standard assessment. Path analyses indicated that higher SES predicted higher levels of EC at T2 and language skills at T3, and greater levels of household chaos at T2 predicted poorer EC and language skills a year later, even when controlling for stability of the constructs. Results indicated that T2 EC partially mediated the relations between SES and T3 language skills. Findings from this study can be used to identify key factors for early learning and perhaps inform programs designed to support families and young children.

Causality Influences Children's and Adults' Experience of Temporal Order	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Although it has long been known that time is a cue to causation, recent work with adults has demonstrated that causality can also influence the experience of time. In causal reordering (Bechlivanidis & Lagnado, 2013, 2016) adults tend to report the causally consistent order of events rather than the correct temporal order. However, the effect has yet to be demonstrated in children. Across four preregistered experiments, 4- to 10-year-old children (N = 813) and adults (N = 178) watched a 3-object Michotte-style "pseudocollision." While in the canonical version of the clip, object A collided with B, which then collided with object C (order: ABC), the pseudocollision involved the same spatial array of objects but featured object C moving before object B (order: ACB), with no collision between B and C. Participants- were asked to judge the temporal order of events and whether object B collided with C. Across all age groups, participants were significantly more likely to judge that B collided with C in the 3-object pseudocollision than in a 2-object control clip (where clear causal direction was lacking), despite the spatiotemporal relations between B and C being identical in the two clips (Experiments 1-3). Collision judgments and temporal order judgments were not entirely consistent, with some participants-particularly in the younger age range-basing their temporal order judgments on spatial rather than temporal information (Experiment 4). We conclude that in both children and adults, rather than causal impressions being determined only by the basic spatial-temporal properties of object movement, schemata are used in a top-down manner when interpreting perceptual displays.

The current study developed the Children's Future Thinking Questionnaire (CFTQ), a parent-report on 3- to 7-year-olds' future-oriented cognition. The CFTQ showed high internal consistency and detected development of future-oriented cognition (Study 1; N = 145). Study 2 (N = 255) showed high internal consistency reliability and preliminary validity of the CFTQ. Study 3 (N = 101) confirmed strong reliability and validity of the CFTQ. Study 4 (N = 105) revealed excellent test-retest reliability of the CFTQ. Thus, the CFTQ is the first reliable and valid parent-report measure of children's developing future-oriented cognitive abilities.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				APR	2020	56	4					756	772		10.1037/dev0000885	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000885								31904250					WOS:000518804000007
J	McAuliffe, K; Blake, PR; Warneken, F				McAuliffe, Katherine; Blake, Peter R.; Warneken, Felix			Costly Fairness in Children Is Influenced by Who Is Watching	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Advantageous inequity aversion emerges relatively late in child development, yet the mechanisms explaining its late emergence are poorly understood. Here, we ask whether children begin to reject advantageous inequity, a costly form of fairness, once reputational concerns are in place. Specifically, we examine the role of peer monitoring in promoting fair behavior. In Study 1 (N = 212 pairs; Ages 6 to 9), we test whether children are less likely to reject advantageous allocations depending on who is aware of their behavior. Results show that children are more likely to accept advantageous allocations when their peer partner is unaware of their advantage. In Study 2 (N = 134 pairs; Ages 8 and 9), we show that this effect is driven specifically by whether the affected peer partners can see the allocation and not by whether third-party peer observers witness the decision. Together, these results shed light on the factors influencing fairness development in childhood and, more specifically, suggest that advantageous inequity aversion is influenced by a desire to appear fair to those getting the short end of the stick.

Development of Achievement Goals and Their Relation to Academic Interest and Achievement in Adolescence: A Review of the Literature and Two Longitudinal Studies	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Adolescence is important for the development of achievement motivation, including achievement goal pursuit. Longitudinal research is scarce on adolescents' goal development and its implications for academic outcomes. In our research, we first present a systematic review of findings on achievement goals in adolescence. Then we report 2 longitudinal studies with German adolescents in which we investigated the separate as well as joint development of achievement goals, interest, and achievement in the domain of mathematics. Study 1 comprised 745 students assessed in 4 waves in grades 5-7 (43% female; age M-T1 = 10.66). Study 2 comprised 1,420 students assessed in 4 waves in grades 5-8 (47% female; age M-T1 = 10.58). Students reported their mastery, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance goals and their interest in mathematics. Mathematics achievement was assessed by school grades (Studies 1 and 2) and standardized test scores (Study 1). Data were analyzed using latent growth curve, multiple process, and cross-lagged models. Findings for the 2 studies evidenced a substantial degree of consistency. All goals decreased and the decrease became smaller over time in most instances. Controlling for nonfocal goals and demographic variables (socioeconomic status, gender), multiple process models revealed that change in mastery and performance-approach goals was positively related or unrelated to change in interest and achievement, whereas change in performance-avoidance goals was negatively related or unrelated to change in interest and achievement. Cross-lagged models revealed that relations between the achievement goals on the one hand and interest and achievement on the other hand were reciprocal rather than unidirectional.

Personality Development From Age 2 to 33: Stability and Change in Ego Resiliency and Ego Control and Associations With Adult Adaptation	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The purpose of this study was to examine the developmental course and implications of the personality metatraits ego resiliency and ego control across the first 3 decades of life. The sample consisted of 139 participants who were assessed 9 times between ages 2 and 33. Participants completed measures of ego resiliency, ego control, Big Five personality traits, identity development, and positive and negative well-being. The findings indicated strong stability of ego resiliency, in terms of both rank-order and mean-level change. Ego control also demonstrated stability over the full time span, but there was greater change in childhood relative to adolescence and adulthood. Ego resiliency and control were associated with adult well-being, but these associations were generally accounted for by the Big Five traits. Finally, there were small relations between ego resiliency and control in childhood and later adult identity development processes.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				APR	2020	56	4					815	832		10.1037/dev0000895	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000895								31999183					WOS:000518804000011

I suggest that although understanding our emotions is an important part of emotional development; emotional development cannot be reduced to concept development, even when such concepts include understanding of physiological and behavioral responses and feelings. I highlight the importance of emotions as promoters of immediate and urgent responses that cannot and should not be preceded by contemplative thought, and as the core of who we are as individuals, and I discuss the many levels at which emotional development occurs-from gene to behavior. I recommend that interdisciplinary teams work together to enable research that helps the field in better understanding emotional development in its full complexity.

Definitions of emotions guide how researchers deal with fundamental theoretical and methodological issues in emotion research. In this commentary, we contrast 2 views of emotion: the structuralist and functionalist perspectives. We illustrate the consequences of each view for the design and interpretation of empirical research and highlight benefits of adopting a functionalist perspective on emotional development.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				APR	2020	56	4					837	840		10.1037/dev0000887	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000887								32134295					WOS:000518804000013

In doing so, several possible mechanisms or processes (e.g., maintenance of a positive mood, enjoyment of social interaction, the effect of positive social interaction on caring) are briefly discussed. Moreover, the potential importance of attachment status in understanding the relation of positive emotion to prosocial behavior is highlighted.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				APR	2020	56	4					843	845		10.1037/dev0000880	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000880								32134297					WOS:000518804000015
J	Cohen, DJ; Ray, A				Cohen, Dale J.; Ray, Austin			Experimental Bias in Number-Line Tasks and How to Avoid Them: Comment on Kim and Opfer (2017) and the Introduction of the Cohen Ray Number-Line Task	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Kim and Opfer (2017) report data that demonstrate children produce a negatively accelerating (e.g., logarithmic) response pattern in the unbounded number-line task. This pattern of results is the opposite of those generally reported for the unbounded number-line task (e.g., Cohen & Blanc-Goldhammer, 2011; Cohen & Sarnecka, 2014). We believe Kim and Opfer's (2017) experimental procedure inadvertently biased participants' data in the unbounded task. Here, we (a) outline the factors that induce experimental bias in computerized number-line tasks, (b) identify the likely source of experimental bias in Kim and Opfer (2017) that led to the negatively accelerating pattern of data, (c) introduce a new number-line variation (the universal number-line task), and (d) introduce a publicly available, open source number-line task that provides researchers with a simple, robust, and correct method for collecting data on the unbounded, bounded, and universal number-line tasks. We conclude that Kim and Opfer's (2017) implementation of the unbounded number-line is biased, and therefore cannot provide meaningful support for the log-to-linear shift hypothesis.

Compression Is Evident in Children's Unbounded and Bounded Numerical Estimation: Reply to Cohen and Ray (2020)	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Kim and Opfer (2017) found that number-line estimates increased approximately logarithmically with number when an upper bound (e.g., 100 or 1000) was explicitly marked (bounded condition) and when no upper bound was marked (unbounded condition). Using procedural suggestions from Cohen and Ray (2020), we examined whether this logarithmicity might come from restrictions on the response space provided. Consistent with our previous findings, logarithmicity was evident whether tasks were bounded or unbounded, with the degree of logarithmicity tied to the numerical value of the estimates rather than the response space per se. We also found a clear log-to-linear shift in numerical estimates. Results from Bayesian modeling supported the idea that unbounded tasks are qualitatively similar to bounded ones, but unbounded ones lead to greater logarithmicity. Our findings support the original findings of Kim and Opfer (2017) and extend their generality to more age groups and more varieties of number-line estimation.

Introduction to the Special Issue: Socialization of Emotion and Self-Regulation: Understanding Processes and Application	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Over 20 years ago, Eisenberg, Cumberland, and Spinrad (1998; Eisenberg, Spinrad, & Cumberland, 1998) published a landmark article focusing on the socialization of children's emotion and self-regulation, including emotion regulation. In this special issue, our goal was to compile current evidence delineating the impact of emotion-related socialization behaviors (ERSBs) on children's emotion, self-regulation, and developmental outcomes. The work in this issue highlights the processes involved in predicting both parents' ERSBs as well as children's developmental outcomes. Researchers have moved beyond testing individual "pieces" of the socialization of emotion model and now use innovative and sophisticated methods for testing larger models, allowing for more causal interpretations. Special issue contributors focused on longitudinal studies including ERSBs, reviews of the literature extending the original model, and the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve the emotional lives of children and their families. We focus on some of the major themes of the special issue and conclude with recommendations for policies and programs to promote youths' effective emotion-related outcomes.

J	Leerkes, EM; Bailes, LG; Augustine, ME				Leerkes, Esther M.; Bailes, Lauren G.; Augustine, Mairin E.			The Intergenerational Transmission of Emotion Socialization	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We examined the extent to which new mothers' recollections of their mothers' emotion socialization practices during childhood predict sensitive/supportive responses to their own toddlers in distressing situations both directly and indirectly via effects on mothers' social information processing about infant cry signals. Mothers' adult attachment was tested as a possible moderator and we tested model invariance across racial groups. These questions were assessed using a 3-wave longitudinal study of first-time mothers (131 African American, 128 European American) followed from pregnancy until children were 14 months old. Expectant mothers were administered the Adult Attachment Interview and self-report measures of remembered childhood emotion socialization. When infants were 6 months old, mothers' cry processing was assessed using a video-recall method in which they watched videos of their interactions with their infants during distress tasks and reported on their emotions and cognitions during the interaction. Maternal sensitivity to distress at 14 months was assessed via observed maternal sensitivity during distress tasks and mothers' self-reported responses to child distress. Consistent with prediction, mothers who recalled their own mothers as high on nonsupportive responses to their distress in childhood engaged in more self-focused and negative cry processing at 6 months, which in turn predicted less supportive responding to their toddlers in distressing situations. This indirect effect was statistically significant. These effects were not moderated by adult attachment coherence. The full model was invariant across racial groups. Thus, remembered childhood emotion socialization experiences have longstanding consequences for subsequent social behavior, including parenting the next generation.

J	Hajal, NJ; Paley, B				Hajal, Nastassia J.; Paley, Blair			Parental Emotion and Emotion Regulation: A Critical Target of Study for Research and Intervention to Promote Child Emotion Socialization	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Parents' behaviors-particularly their emotion socialization behaviors (ESBs)-drive children's emotion socialization (Eisenberg, Cumberland, & Spinrad, 1998). We propose that a major next step in the effort to promote healthy emotional development is to improve the field's understanding of the most proximal contributor to parent ESBs: parents' own experience and regulation of emotions in the context of caregiving. As an initial step, this paper integrates Eisenberg and colleagues' model of emotion socialization with theoretical and empirical work on parental emotion. We review the literature on the emotionally evocative nature of parenting, which influences parental ESBs, including parents' expressions of emotions and their responses to children's emotions. However, whereas parental emotions influence behavior, they do not necessarily determine it; parents may regulate their emotions to engage in optimal ESBs. Thus, parental regulation contributes to emotion socialization not only by modeling emotion regulation strategies for children, but also by influencing the quality of parents' ESBs. From a clinical perspective, parental emotion regulation is of utmost importance due to the degree of parental involvement in interventions for childhood emotional and behavioral disorders, which are often aimed at promoting child self-regulation. To illustrate practical applications of Eisenberg's model, we discuss evidence-based practices that include enhancement of parent emotion regulation as a primary target, with the ultimate goal of promoting child emotional development. Ultimately, we aim to spur future theoretical, empirical, and translational work in this area.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				MAR	2020	56	3			SI		403	417		10.1037/dev0000864	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000864								32077713					WOS:000516578800003

An Empirical Test of the Model of Socialization of Emotion: Maternal and Child Contributors to Preschoolers' Emotion Knowledge and Adjustment	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study tested child characteristics (temperamental executive control and negative reactivity) and maternal characteristics (parenting behaviors and maternal depressive symptoms) as predictors of a mother's emotion-related socialization behaviors (ERSBs). Further, parenting behaviors and ERSBs were examined as predictors of children's emotion knowledge, social competence, and adjustment problems. ERSBs and children's emotion knowledge were tested as mediators of the effects of child and parent characteristics on adjustment. A community sample (N = 306) of mothers and children (36-40 months at T1) were assessed 4 times, once every 9 months, and assessments included maternal reports of depressive symptoms, observed temperament, observational ratings of general parenting at T1, maternal report of ERSBs at T1 & T2, behavioral measures of emotion knowledge at T3, and teacher ratings of children's adjustment at T4. There were no predictors of ERSBs above prior levels. Higher executive control and lower maternal depressive symptoms predicted greater child emotion knowledge, highlighting the roles of maternal and child contributors to emotion knowledge. Greater emotion knowledge and positive affective quality in parenting predicted children's adjustment, with emotion knowledge mediating the effects of executive control on children's adjustment. In addition, lower levels of maternal supportive ERSBs predicted greater adjustment problems. This study highlights the roles of key variables in Eisenberg, Cumberland, and Spinrad's (1998) heuristic model of emotion socialization and the importance of emotion socialization and emotion knowledge in children's adjustment.

J	Boldt, LJ; Goffin, KC; Kochanska, G				Boldt, Lea J.; Goffin, Kathryn C.; Kochanska, Grazyna			The Significance of Early Parent-Child Attachment for Emerging Regulation: A Longitudinal Investigation of Processes and Mechanisms From Toddler Age to Preadolescence	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Eisenberg, Cumberland, and Spinrad (1998; Eisenberg, Spinrad, & Cumberland, 1998) included parent-child attachment as a key dimension of the early emotion socialization environment. We examined processes linking children's early attachment with social regulation and adjustment in preadolescence in 102 community mothers, fathers, and children. Security of attachment, assessed at 2 years, using observers' Attachment Q-Set (Waters, 1987), was posited as a significant, although indirect, predictor of children's adaptive social regulation at 10 and 12 years. We proposed that security initiated paths to future social regulation by promoting children's capacities for emotion regulation in response to frustration at 3, 4.5, and 5.5 years: having to suppress a desired behavior, observed in delay tasks, to regulate anger, observed in parent-child control contexts, and a traitlike tendency to regulate anger when frustrated, rated by parents. We conceptualized adaptive social regulation at 10 and 12 years as encompassing regulation of negative emotional tone, observed in diverse parent-child interactions, parent-rated regulation of negativity in broad social interactions, and child-reported internalization of adults' values and standards of conduct. Multiple-mediation analyses documented two paths parallel for mother- and father-child relationships: From security to emotion regulation in delay tasks to internalization of adults' values, and from security to parent-rated traitlike regulation of anger to parent-rated regulation of negativity in broad social interactions. Two additional paths were present for mothers and children only.

Brent			Positive Parenting, Effortful Control, and Developmental Outcomes Across Early Childhood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The current study evaluated bidirectional associations between mother and father positive parenting and child effortful control. Data were drawn from 220 families when children were 3, 4, 5, and 6 years old. Parenting and effortful control were assessed when the child was 3, 4, and 5 years old. These variables were used to statistically predict child externalizing and school performance assessed when the child was 6 years old. The study used random intercept cross-lagged panel models to evaluate within-person and between-person associations between parenting and effortful control. Results suggest that prior positive parenting was associated with later effortful control, whereas effortful control was not associated with subsequent parenting from ages 3 to 5. Stable between-child differences in effortful control from ages 3 to 5 were associated with school performance at age 6. These stable between-child differences in effortful control were correlated with externalizing at age 3.

Mothers, fathers, and adolescents (N = 1,298 families) from 12 cultural groups in 9 countries (China, Colombia, Italy, Jordan, Kenya, Philippines, Sweden, Thailand, and United States) were interviewed when children were about 13 years old and again 1 and 2 years later. Models were examined separately for mothers and fathers. Overall, cross-cultural similarities emerged in the associations of both mothers' and fathers' irritability, as well as of mothers' self-efficacy about anger regulation, with subsequent maternal harsh parenting and adolescent irritability, and in the associations of the latter variables with adolescents' internalizing and externalizing problems. The findings suggest that processes linking mothers' and fathers' emotion socialization and emotionality in diverse cultures to adolescent problem behaviors are somewhat similar.

J	Curtis, K; Zhou, Q; Tao, AN				Curtis, Kaley; Zhou, Qing; Tao, Annie			Emotion Talk in Chinese American Immigrant Families and Longitudinal Links to Children's Socioemotional Competence	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Parent emotion talk (ET), a type of emotion-related socialization practice, is theorized to foster children's emotion-related regulation and socioemotional skills. Yet, there has been limited research linking parent ET to children's effortful control, a top-down regulatory process. Despite the observed cultural differences in ET between Chinese and European American families, few researchers tested whether the socioemotional benefits of ET are generalizable to Chinese American families, an immigrant group with contrasting values in their heritage and host cultures. The present study examined Chinese American parents' ET, its associations with sociocultural factors, and prospective relations to school-age children's effortful control, sympathy, and socially appropriate behaviors. In a two-wave (1.5 years apart) longitudinal study of first- and second-generation Chinese American children (N = 258, age = 6-9 years at Wave 1, 52% from low-income families), the content and quality of parent ET (e.g., the overall quality of emotion talk, frequency of emotion explanations, emotion questions, and number of emotion words) was coded from a video-recorded shared book reading task. Children's effortful control, sympathy, and social behaviors were rated by parents, teachers, and children. Results showed that the Chinese American parents from lower socioeconomic status families, families with lower English proficiency, or more recent immigrants displayed lower ET. Parent ET was prospectively related to children's higher effortful control after controlling for stability, and higher effortful control was concurrently associated with children's higher sympathy and more socially appropriate behaviors. The findings provide empirical support for the socioemotional benefits of ET for school-age children in Chinese American immigrant families.

Parent Socialization of Emotion in a High-Risk Sample	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The Socialization of Emotion (Eisenberg, Cumberland, & Spinrad, 1998; Eisenberg, Spinrad, & Cumberland, 1998) model creates a theoretical framework for understanding parents' direct and indirect influences on children's emotional development, including the influence of parent characteristics on subsequent emotion specific parenting. Large numbers of children live in families with fathers who have alcohol problems, setting the stage for cascading risk across development. For instance, fathers' alcohol problems are a marker of risk for higher family conflict, increased parental depression and antisociality, and less sensitive parenting, leading to dysregulated child emotion and behavior. We examined a conceptual model for emotion socialization in a community sample of alcoholic and nonalcoholic father families (N = 227) recruited in infancy (i.e., 12 months) with follow-ups to adolescence (i.e., 15-19 years), and examined if hypothesized paths differed by child sex or group status (alcoholic vs. nonalcoholic families). Results indicated significant indirect effects between parent psychopathology and sensitivity in early childhood to both adaptive (e.g., emotion regulation) and maladaptive (e.g., aggression and peer delinquency) outcomes in middle childhood to adolescence via child negative emotionality and supportive emotion socialization. There were significant differences by child sex and alcohol group status. Implications for intervention and prevention are discussed.

Maternal Emotion Socialization in Early Childhood Predicts Adolescents' Amygdala-vmPFC Functional Connectivity to Emotion Faces	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Guided by Eisenberg, Cumberland, and Spinrad's (1998) conceptual framework, we examined multiple components of maternal emotion socialization (i.e., reactions to children's negative emotion, emotion talk, emotional expressiveness) at 33 months of age as predictors of adolescents' amygdala-vmPFC connectivity and amygdala activation when labeling and passively observing angry and happy faces. For angry faces, more positive maternal emotion socialization behaviors predicted (a) less positive amygdala-vmPFC connectivity, which may reflect more mature vmPFC downregulation of the amygdala activation underlying implicit emotion regulation, and (b) more amygdala activation, which may reflect higher sensitivity to others' emotional cues. Associations between negative emotion socialization behaviors and neural responses to angry faces were nonsignificant, and findings for the models predicting neural responses to happy faces showed a less consistent pattern. By expanding Eisenberg et al.'s (1998) framework to consider neural processing of negative emotions, the current findings point toward the potential long-term implications of positive emotion socialization experiences during early childhood for optimal functioning of the amygdala-vmPFC circuitry during adolescence.

A Review of Associations Between Parental Emotion Socialization Behaviors and the Neural Substrates of Emotional Reactivity and Regulation in Youth	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												As highlighted by Eisenberg, Cumberland, and Spinrad (1998), parents play a critical role in children's socioemotional development, in part, by shaping how children and adolescents process, respond to, and regulate their emotions ( i.e., emotional reactivity/regulation). Although evidence for associations between parenting behavior and youth's emotional processing has relied primarily on behavioral measures of emotion, researchers have begun to examine how parenting is related to the neural substrates of youth's reactivity and regulation. This article reviews a growing literature linking parental behavior with structural brain development as well as functional activity and connectivity in neural regions supporting emotional reactivity/ regulation during infancy, childhood, and adolescence. By focusing on normative parental behaviors, we evaluate the evidence for associations between typical variations in caregiving and neural processes thought to support youth's emotional reactivity/regulation. The purpose of this review is to (1) extend the model put forth by Eisenberg and colleagues to consider the ways that parenting behaviors are related to neural substrates of youth's emotional reactivity and regulation; (2) review the empirical evidence for associations between parenting, particularly parental "emotion-related socialization behaviors" (ERSBs), and neural substrates of youth's emotional reactivity/regulation; and (3) recommend future directions for this emerging area of research.

Parental Support of Self-Regulation Among Children at Risk for Externalizing Symptoms: Developmental Trajectories of Physiological Regulation and Behavioral Adjustment	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Children with externalizing symptoms typically show dysregulated arousal when facing emotional challenges and are at risk for antisocial outcomes later in life. The model of emotion socialization (Eisenberg, Cumberland, & Spinrad, 1998) points to supportive emotion-related parenting as central to promoting children's regulatory capability and behavioral adjustment. However, the role of emotionrelated parenting is less clear for children living in disadvantaged conditions and already displaying behavioral problems, and little is known about how these parenting practices shape the physiological underpinnings of behavioral adjustment. This study examined the relation between supportive emotionrelated parenting and the trajectories of physiological regulation and externalizing symptoms across early school years among 207 children (66% male) from high-risk urban communities, who showed aggressive/oppositional behaviors at school entry. Mothers' supportive emotion-related parenting was observed in kindergarten during structured interactions. Children's respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), an indicator of parasympathetic influence over cardiac arousal, was measured at rest and during an anger scene each year from kindergarten to the 2nd grade. Teacher ratings of externalizing symptoms were also obtained every year. Over time, supportive emotion-related parenting was related to a developmental trend from RSA augmentation toward RSA withdrawal during the anger scene as well as lower risk for escalating externalizing symptoms. The developmental changes of RSA reactivity partially accounted for the relation between parenting and trajectories of externalizing symptoms. Findings underscore the potential of supportive emotion-related parenting for diverting at-risk children from antisocial trajectories by shaping their physiological regulation and behavioral adjustment.

Few extant studies have examined this question across multiple developmental periods and levels of analysis. Here, we tested whether mothers' supportive and nonsupportive reactions to their 5-year-old children's negative emotions were associated with teacher and adolescent self-reported adjustment at age 15 via children's physiological and behavioral emotion regulation at age 10 (N = 404). Results showed that maternal supportive reactions to their children's negative emotions were associated with children's greater emotion regulation in a laboratory task and also a composite of mother and teacher reports of emotion regulation at age 10. Maternal nonsupportive reactions to their children's negative emotions were uncorrelated with supportive reactions, but were associated with poorer child physiological regulation and also poorer mother- and teacher-reported emotion regulation at age 10. In turn, better physiological regulation at age 10 was associated with more adolescent-reported social competence at age 15. Furthermore, teacher and mother reports of emotion regulation at age 10 were associated with increased adolescent adjustment across all domains. Mediational effects from nonsupportive and supportive reactions to adolescent adjustment tested via bootstrapping were significant. Our findings suggest that mothers' reactions to their children's negative emotions in early childhood may play a role in their children's ability to regulate their arousal both physiologically and behaviorally in middle childhood, which in turn may play a role in their ability to manage their emotions and behaviors and to navigate increasingly complex social contexts in adolescence.

According to Eisenberg, Cumberland, and Spinrad's (1998) model, ongoing parental reactions to emotions and discussions of emotion indirectly shape children's socioemotional competence throughout childhood and adolescence. Typically developing adolescents-girls especially-are at increased risk for developing internalizing symptoms. We examined if and how emotion dynamics of mother-daughter interactions contribute to adolescent girls' internalizing symptoms. We applied grid-sequence analysis (Brinberg, Fosco, & Ram, 2017) to observational data obtained while N = 96 typically developing adolescent girls (M-age = 13.99 years) and their mothers engaged in 5 different emotionally-laden discussions. We identified patterns of expressed emotions that unfolded during each discussion and examined how interdyad differences in those patterns were associated with mothers' and daughters' internalizing symptoms. Dyads differed with respect to whether mothers or daughters tended to regulate positive emotion expressions. Interdyad differences in moment-to-moment dynamics of happy/excited and worried/sad discussions were associated with adolescent girls' social anxiety symptoms, although differences in emotion dynamics of proud, frustrated/annoyed, and grateful discussions were not. Taken together, results illustrate how methodological innovations are enabling new examination and detailed description of parent-child emotion socialization dynamics.

Emotion-Related Socialization in the Classroom: Considering the Roles of Teachers, Peers, and the Classroom Context	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The goal of this study was to apply aspects of the heuristic model advanced by Eisenberg, Cumberland, and Spinrad (1998) to the study of socialization that takes place in preschool and elementary school classrooms. Investigating socialization in this context is important given the number of hours students spend in school, the emotional nature of social interactions that take place involving teachers and students, and the emotions students often experience in the context of academic work. Guided by Eisenberg, Cumberland, et al.'s (1998) call to consider complex socialization pathways, we focus our discussion on ways teachers, peers, and the classroom context can shape students' emotion-related outcomes (e.g., self-regulation, adjustment) and academic-related outcomes (e.g., school engagement, achievement) indirectly and differentially (e.g., as a function of student or classroom characteristics). Our illustrative review of the intervention literature demonstrates that the proposed classroom-based socialization processes have clear applied implications, and efforts to improve socialization in the classroom can promote students' emotional and academic competence. We conclude our discussion by outlining areas that require additional study.

In the current longitudinal study, we investigated whether maternal and peer emotion socialization were related to adolescent girls' daily emotions, emotion regulation, and social and emotional adjustment. The sample included 160 adolescent girls from low-income families followed across 2 years. At Time 1 (T1), girls reported on maternal and peer emotion socialization practices during laboratory visits. At Time 2 (T2), girls reported on daily negative and positive affect using ecological momentary assessment across 2 weeks. Emotion regulation, internalizing problems, and prosocial behavior were assessed during laboratory visits at both T1 and 2 years later (Time 3 [T3]). Results demonstrated that higher levels of maternal and peer emotionally supportive socialization practices were associated with lower levels of girls' daily negative affect. Mothers' supportive practices also predicted increases in girls' emotion regulation over time. Both maternal and peer unsupportive practices predicted more internalizing problems, and peer unsupportive practices predicted less prosocial behavior over time. This study supports and expands Eisenberg's heuristic model by demonstrating that both maternal and peer emotion socialization are associated with adolescent girls' emotional and behavioral outcomes, and maternal and peer emotion socialization have differential effects.

In the current investigation, 4 mediators (positive parenting, positive and negative family expressiveness, and maternal sensitive guidance during reminiscing) were examined as process variables through which maltreatment relates to 2 dimensions of child emotional self-regulation (adaptive emotion regulation and lability/negativity) measured across 3 time points (baseline, 2 months, and 6 months later) using longitudinal mediation analysis with latent growth modeling. These processes were evaluated in the context of a randomized controlled trial of a brief intervention aimed at improving maternal sensitive guidance during reminiscing. Participants included 160 maltreating mothers randomized into intervention (n = 81) or control intervention (n = 79) conditions and 78 demographically matched, nonmaltreating mothers and their 3- to 6-yearold children (N = 238). In the primary analysis, maternal sensitive guidance at baseline mediated relations between early maltreatment and emotion regulation and lability/negativity at 6 months, and latent change in emotion regulation across the 3 time points. Additionally, the intervention predicted steeper positive change in emotion regulation. In the secondary analysis, there was evidence of indirect effects of the intervention on emotional self-regulation through maternal sensitive guidance, positive parenting, and positive family expressiveness. Implications and future directions are discussed.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				MAR	2020	56	3			SI		608	622		10.1037/dev0000782	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000782								32077728					WOS:000516578800018

Tuning in to Teens: Investigating Moderators of Program Effects and Mechanisms of Change of an Emotion Focused Group Parenting Program	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												In recent years emotion socialization theory (Eisenberg, Cumberland, & Spinrad, 1998) has begun to be used in parenting interventions, allowing an important and effective method for testing the theory. The current study is one such example, and examined moderators of program effects and mechanisms of change in an emotion-focused group parenting program, Tuning in to Teens (TINT), to determine whether an intervention with this theoretical approach would be effective in improving adolescent internalizing difficulties. Schools were randomized into intervention and control conditions. Data was collected from 225 parents and 224 youth during the young person's final year of elementary school (6th grade) and again, 10 months later in their first year of secondary school (7th grade). Those in the intervention condition received a 6-session program targeting parent emotion awareness/regulation, parental beliefs about emotion and parents' emotion coaching skills. Multilevel analyses were conducted to examine moderators of the intervention and regression analyses were conducted to examine mediators of program effects. Results showed greater benefits for intervention subgroups with high preintervention scores on youth anxiety. Parental internalizing difficulties and parental difficulties in emotion awareness/regulation did not moderate program effects. Mediation analyses supported emotion socialization theory and showed parents' who participated in the TINT parenting program reported improvements in their own awareness/regulation and emotion socialization, which were, in turn, related to reductions in youth internalizing difficulties.

We discuss the development of an EC parenting intervention, outline its key elements, and use preliminary pilot data to illustrate how such a behavioral intervention can yield improvements in behavioral and physiological indices of ER (i.e., respiratory sinus arrhythmia [RSA]) and parent-child relationships and reductions in mental health difficulties in IPV-exposed mothers and their children. A 12-week skills-based EC parenting program was developed and administered in groups. Fifty mothers were assigned to intervention or waitlist groups. Physiological, observational, and questionnaire data were obtained pre- and postintervention. Because of the small sample size, effect sizes were examined for illustrative purposes of potential effects of the EC intervention. Relative to mothers in waitlist group, mothers in the intervention group showed (a) improvements in emotion awareness and coaching, (b) increases in ER as assessed by baseline RSA, (c) increased use of validation and decreased use of sermonizing/lecturing/scolding during parent-child interaction, and (d) increased sense of parenting competence. Relative to children of mothers in the waitlist group, children of mothers in the intervention group showed (a) increases in ER as measured by parent-report and baseline RSA, (b) decreases in negativity during parent-child interaction, and (c) decreases in depressive symptoms. Discussion highlights potential usefulness of an EC parenting intervention for populations at risk for ER and parenting difficulties.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				MAR	2020	56	3			SI		638	651		10.1037/dev0000800	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000800								32077730					WOS:000516578800020

Parental emotion socialization (PES) has been theorized to influence children's behaviors; many studies lend support to this theory. However, longitudinal studies examining PES with experimental designs are sparse. In this study, we estimated PES growth trajectories following a parenting intervention and evaluated whether intervention induced improvements in PES predict child outcomes in postdeployed military families. National Guard/Reserve families with at least one deployed parent and a child aged 4-13 years were randomized into an intervention or control group. Data from all 255 2-parent married families, who were primarily Caucasian and middle-class, were analyzed. PES was indicated by self-reported nonsupportive and supportive reactions to children's negative emotions (baseline, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up). Child behaviors were assessed through averaged mother- and father- reports (baseline and 2-year follow-up). Results of latent growth models showed that mothers and fathers assigned to the intervention condition reported greater improvements in nonsupportive PES (steeper negative slopes) over 2 years relative to controls. Both mothers' and fathers' intervention-induced improvements in nonsupportive PES were associated with decreased child internalizing behaviors. Mothers' intervention-induced improvements in nonsupportive PES were associated with decreased child externalizing behaviors. No significant findings were detected for intervention effects on supportive PES growth trajectories. Our findings supported the indirect effects of the intervention on child behaviors through nonsupportive PES over two years. PES is an important, malleable skill that can be targeted in parenting interventions for postdeployed military families.

The Role of Dynamic, Dyadic Parent-Child Processes in Parental Socialization of Emotion	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												We investigated what a dyadic framework added to Eisenberg, Cumberland, and Spinrad's (1998) parental emotion socialization model based on the argument that the dynamic organization of emotion in the dyad is more than the sum of its parts and thus makes a unique contribution to emotion socialization. Preschoolers (N = 235) completed challenging problem-solving tasks with mothers and fathers, during which parental emotion-related socialization behaviors (ERSBs), child negative emotional arousal, and dyadic positive emotion data were collected. We examined whether dyadic synchrony of positive emotion at age 3 was a mechanism by which age 3 parental ERSBs impacted children's age 5 aggressive behavior in school, accounting for child gender, child negative emotional arousal, and aggressive behavior in preschool. ERSBs were significantly positively related to dyadic positive synchrony with both mothers and fathers at age 3. Longitudinal models supported an indirect effect, not a moderating effect, of dyadic synchrony: both mothers' and fathers' ERSBs contributed to children's less aggressive behavior at age 5 through the effects of higher dyadic positive synchrony. Findings suggest dynamic, dyadic emotional processes should be considered as a mechanism of emotion socialization and that parent-child positive emotional synchrony is supportive of early childhood emotional development.

Results indicated that mediation was significant, such that grandmother-mother cultural socialization, when children were 3 years old, informed greater mother-child cultural socialization when children were 4 years old, which, in turn, informed children's greater receptive language and interactive play with peers when children were 5 years old. Findings highlight the importance of intergenerational cultural socialization on young children's developmental competencies.

Helping Me Helps Us: The Role of Natural Mentors in the Ethnic Identity and Academic Outcomes of Latinx Adolescents	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This research investigated the potential contributions of natural mentoring relationships and ethnic identity to the academic attitudes and performance of Latinx high school students. In a sample of 347 urban Latinx students in grades 9 and 10, analyses examined the presence and quality of mentoring relationships as well as ethnic identity exploration and affirmation as predictors of changes in grade point average and the perceived economic value of education. Analyses included tests for a hypothesized role of ethnic identity in mediating associations of mentoring measures with the academic outcomes. The presence of a mentoring relationship was not significantly related to ethnic identity or change in academic outcomes over time. However, mentoring relationship quality was associated with a more positive ethnic identity, and support was found for the hypothesis that ethnic identity mediates the association between the quality of mentoring relationships and change over time in the economic values toward education among Latinx adolescents. Study findings suggest the importance of supportive adults in the ethnic identity and academic outcomes of Latinx adolescents.

The Development of Mother-Infant Coordination Across the First Year of Life	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Early mother-infant coordinated interactions play a critical role in infant development. The present study describes the development of the dyadic coordination of vocalization and gaze behavior between mothers and infants over the first year of life. In addition to describing developmental trajectories of behavior, the study contributes to our understanding of dyadic coordination by investigating how different measures of coordination relate to one another and how individual behaviors relate to dyadic coordination within the vocal and gaze domains. Thirty dyads were recorded playing together with a standard set of toys when infants were 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age, and mother and infant vocalization and gaze behaviors were coded from these videos on a moment-to-moment basis. Coordination was analyzed using both cross-recurrence quantitative analysis and event-based measures of analysis. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine developmental trajectories of vocalization and gaze coordination. Results indicated that dyadic coordination of the timing of vocalization and gaze behaviors is a very early emerging phenomenon that is supported by both mothers and infants. Vocal coordination did not show developmental change over time, whereas mothers and infants became increasingly coordinated in their gaze behaviors as infants got older. Taken together, findings from this study highlight the importance of considering bidirectional and developmental influences on parent and infant behavior.

Shorter telomere length and greater erosion have been associated with compromised physical and mental health and are hypothesized to be affected by early life stress. In the latter case, most work has relied on retrospective measures of early life stressors. The Dutch research (n = 193) presented herein tested 3 hypotheses prospectively regarding effects of sensitive-insensitive parenting during the first 2.5 years on telomere length at age 6, when first measured, and change over the following 4 years. It was predicted that (1) less sensitive parenting would predict shorter telomeres and greater erosion and that such effects would be most pronounced in children (2) exposed to prenatal stress and/or (3) who were highly negatively emotional as infants. Results revealed, only, that prenatal stress amplified parenting effects on telomere change-in a differential-susceptibility-related manner: Prenatally stressed children displayed more erosion when they experienced insensitive parenting and less erosion when they experienced sensitive parenting. Mechanisms that might initiate greater postnatal plasticity as a result of prenatal stress are highlighted and future work outlined.

Although the exact mechanism accounting for these children's neuropsychological abnormalities is unknown, there is evidence to suggest that the cognitive and behavioral disturbances seen in this population may result from a slower development of the attentional system. However, it remains unclear whether prematurity affects the development of the entire attention system or if prematurely born children have a selective insufficiency of components of this system (i.e., orienting, alerting, executive). We compared the efficiency of the attentional system of very prematurely born children and full-term controls at 5 years of age, using the Attention Network Task-Child Version. In comparison to full-term peers, very preterm children exhibited inefficient orienting of attention, whereas there was no group difference in the efficiency of alerting and executive aspects of attention. The reason for the selectively suboptimal orienting of attention in very prematurely born preschoolers remains unclear; it is possible that the neural substrates of this attentional subsystem are particularly underdeveloped in the preschool period in this cohort.

J	Pedrett, S; Kaspar, L; Frick, A				Pedrett, Salome; Kaspar, Lea; Frick, Andrea			Understanding of Object Rotation Between Two and Three Years of Age	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Toddlers' understanding of object rotation was investigated using a multimethod approach. Participants were 44 toddlers between 22 and 38 months of age. In an eye-tracking task, they observed a shape that rotated and disappeared briefly behind an occluder. In an object-fitting task, they rotated wooden blocks and fit them through apertures. Results of the eye-tracking task showed that with increasing age, the toddlers encoded the visible rotation using a more complex eye-movement pattern, increasingly combining tracking movements with gaze shifts to the pivot point. During occlusion, anticipatory looks to the location where the shape would reappear increased with age, whereas looking back to the location where the shape had just disappeared decreased. This suggests that, with increasing age, the toddlers formed a clearer mental representation about the object and its rotational movement. In the object-fitting task, the toddlers succeeded more with increasing age and also rotated the wooden blocks more often correctly before they tried to insert them. Importantly, these preadjustments correlated with anticipatory eye movements, suggesting that both measures tap the same underlying understanding of object rotation. The findings yield new insights into the relation between tasks using looking times and behavioral measures as dependent variables and thus may help to clarify performance differences that have previously been observed in studies with infants and young children.

J	Goddu, MK; Gopnik, A				Goddu, Mariel K.; Gopnik, Alison			Learning What to Change: Young Children Use "Difference-Making" to Identify Causally Relevant Variables	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Novel causal systems pose a problem of variable choice: How can a reasoner decide which variable is causally relevant? Which variable in the system should a learner manipulate to try to produce a desired, yet unfamiliar, casual outcome? In much causal reasoning research, participants learn how a particular set of preselected variables produce a particular effect. Here, we investigate 3- to 5-year-olds' ability to select the relevant variable for intervention in a novel causal system. Results demonstrate that even young children can learn which variable is causally relevant from sparse evidence. In particular, children infer that variables that are "difference-making" in one causal system will also be relevant to other, novel, causal problems. If manipulating a causal variable in a particular way leads to one effect, children assume that other manipulations of that variable will lead to other novel effects.

However, it is unclear whether contingent responsivity from a digital book could provide similar support for children. The effects on story recall and engagement interacting with a digital book that responded contingently on children's vocalizations (contingent book) were investigated, with a focus on the role of individual differences in attention. The study used a within-subject design with 3 experiments from 90 3- to 5-year-old children. Children were presented with a contingent book and 3 noncontingent control conditions: a board book (Experiment 1), a static digital book (Experiment 2), and an animated book (Experiment 3). The use of the contingent book significantly increased children's story recall and was found to be especially useful for children with less developed attention regulation.

Age-Varying Associations of Parental Knowledge and Antisocial Peer Behavior With Adolescent Substance Use	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Antisocial peer behavior and low parental knowledge of adolescents' activities are key interpersonal risk factors for adolescent substance use. However, how the magnitude of associations between these risk factors and substance use may vary across adolescence remains less well understood. The present study examined the age-varying associations of parental knowledge and antisocial peer behavior with adolescents' substance use (i.e., cigarette use, drunkenness, and marijuana use) using time-varying effect modeling. Using data from the Promoting School-Community-University Partnerships to Enhance Resilience (PROSPER) study, the final sample consists of 8,222 adolescents, followed from Grade 6 to Grade 12 (age 11 to age 18.9), including those who newly joined the schools at the targeted grade levels. Results showed that low parental knowledge and antisocial peer behavior were significantly associated with the use of each of the three substances across the majority of adolescence. The magnitude of the associations between substance use and both risk factors decreased across age, except between peer risk and marijuana use. Further, there was a significant interaction between parent and peer risk factors such that low parental knowledge was less strongly associated with substance use at higher levels of antisocial peer behavior. Findings highlighted early adolescence as an important period to target parent and peer prevention and interventions for reducing early substance use.

J	Pham, T; Buchsbaum, D				Pham, Theresa; Buchsbaum, Daphna			Children's Use of Majority Information Is Influenced by Pragmatic Inferences and Task Domain	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Do children always conform to a majority's testimony, or do the pragmatics of that testimony matter? We investigated the influence of pragmatics on conforming to a majority across 2 domains: when learning about object labels and when learning about causal relationships. Four- and 5-year-olds (N = 250) were given a choice between an object endorsed by a 3-person majority, or one endorsed by a single minority informant. Within each domain, there were 4 pragmatic conditions, each with modified testimony so that the majority either explicitly provided an opinion about or pragmatically implied their opinion about the alternative object chosen by the minority. In the unendorsed condition, informants explicitly unendorsed the unchosen object. In the implied condition, informants said nothing about the unchosen object. In the ignorance condition, informants explicitly expressed ignorance about the unchosen object, and in the hidden condition, the chosen object was the only one present at the time of the endorsement. We found that children were most likely to endorse the majority object in the unendorsed condition, in which the majority's opinion was explicitly stated, and least likely in the hidden condition, in which only one object at a time was present, with the other 2 conditions intermediate. Children's preference for majority testimony also depended on the task domain, with a stronger preference for the majority in the language task than causal task. Children might not simply have a majority bias; rather, they use majority information differently depending on the pragmatics and task demands.

Social Inclusion Increases Over Early Childhood and Is Influenced by Others' Group Membership	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examined preschoolers' social inclusion-the active involvement of new partners into social interactions-in different intergroup contexts. Using an interactive paradigm, 3- to 5-year-old German children played a ball-tossing game with 2 puppets in which 1 puppet initiated the game with the child and another approached the game. In Study 1 (N = 144), the initiator was from an ingroup while an outgroup puppet approached the game (ingroup/outgroup condition) or the child and the 2 puppets did not have any group membership (control condition). Social inclusion was assessed by analyzing whether and how children included the approaching puppet into the game. Results revealed that children were more inclusive with increasing age. Across age, children were less willing to include the approaching puppet in the intergroup context as compared to the control context. To further investigate whether the difference between conditions was driven by a preference for the ingroup or a derogation of the outgroup, a second study (N = 72) was conducted. Here, the initiating puppet was neutral (i.e., no group membership) and the approaching puppet was from an outgroup (neutral/outgroup condition). In this condition, social inclusion was in between the 2 conditions of Study 1. Further, the developmental trajectory found in Study 1 could be replicated in Study 2 such that children were more likely to include the approaching puppet with increasing age. These results suggest that children's willingness to include others increases over preschool age and is influenced by both ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation.

Stereotype Endorsement, Disadvantage Awareness, and Social-Emotional Challenges in Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with social-emotional difficulties, including internalizing and externalizing problems, as early as toddlerhood. The aim of the current study was to understand whether economically disadvantaged children's beliefs about the consequences and correlates of poverty (poverty stereotypes) and their beliefs about their personal economic disadvantage contribute to their social-emotional functioning. Interviews were conducted with 94 socioeconomically diverse 4- to 9-year-old children, whose parents reported on their social-emotional functioning and family socioeconomic disadvantage. As hypothesized, among relatively socioeconomically disadvantaged children, perceived disadvantage was associated with social-emotional functioning. The same relation was not found for relatively socioeconomically advantaged children. Socioeconomically disadvantaged children who endorsed higher levels of personal disadvantage had more attention problems and more anxious-depressive symptoms than socioeconomically disadvantaged children who endorsed lower levels of personal disadvantage. In addition, only among socioeconomically disadvantaged children (and not among relatively advantaged children) was negative stereotyping associated with attention problems. Socioeconomically disadvantaged children who endorsed more negative stereotypes had higher levels of attention problems. There was no evidence of an association between negative stereotyping and anxious-depressive symptoms and no moderation of this relation by socioeconomic status. Implications and directions for future research are discussed in light of several relevant theoretical frameworks, including stigma consciousness, status anxiety, and critical consciousness.

The Mindful Adolescent: Developmental Changes in Nonreactivity to Inner Experiences and Its Association With Emotional Well-Being	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Little is known about the naturalistic development of mindfulness in adolescence and how it relates to changes in emotional well-being. The current longitudinal study examined the development of one dimension of mindfulness, nonreactivity to difficult inner experience (or in more colloquial terms, being able to notice, but "take a step back" from distressing thoughts), in a racially and socioeconomically diverse sample (N = 1,657) during the transition from middle school to high school. Students participated in up to four assessment waves, from fall of 8th grade through spring of 9th grade, in which they completed self-report measures assessing nonreactivity, perceived stress, and positive and negative affect. Latent growth curve models indicated that levels of nonreactivity increased during the 2-year study period. Developmental change in nonreactivity varied minimally by gender, socioeconomic status (SES), and race/ethnicity. Parallel process latent growth curve models showed that changes in nonreactivity were associated with concomitant reductions in perceived stress and negative affect, and increases in positive affect. Random intercept cross-lagged panel models showed that within-person nonreactivity prospectively predicted changes in perceived stress and positive affect, but not negative affect. This study is among the first to track the naturalistic development of mindfulness during adolescence. Results suggest that the nonreactivity dimension of mindfulness is associated with aspects of emotional wellbeing during the transition from middle school to high school.

Study 2 analyzed the norming sample of the Berlin Intelligence Structure Test with 1,506 German students (44% female; M-age = 14.54, SD = 1.35, range = 10.00-18.42). Results of Study 1 supported the ability differentiation hypothesis but not the developmental differentiation hypothesis. Rather, the findings pointed to age-dedifferentiation (i.e., higher correlations between different abilities with increasing age). There was evidence for an interaction between age and ability differentiation, with greater ability differentiation found for older adolescents. Study 2 provided little evidence for ability differentiation but largely replicated the findings for age dedifferentiation and the interaction between age and ability differentiation. The present results provide insight into the complex dynamics underlying the development of intelligence structure during adolescence. Implications for the assessment of intelligence are discussed.

Infants and Adults Represent Faces Differently	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This research examined how 5-, 8-, and 11-month-olds with female primary caregivers mentally represented faces using a familiarization procedure similar to real-world experience in which infants have greater exposure to female faces aged 21-39 years than other face types. We predicted infants would form weighted representations of faces (i.e., representations weighted toward the most frequently seen faces) and would more easily form weighted representations of female than male faces given their predominant experience with women (Experiments 1 and 2). We also tested adults using this familiarization procedure (Experiment 3) and predicted they would form averaged representations of faces based on data showing that preferences for averageness (the mathematical central tendency of a population) get stronger with development. Data from the three studies supported these hypotheses. Differences in how infants and adults mentally represent faces might be developmentally advantageous and such representations provide a mechanism to help explain the differential expertise in infants' and adults' face processing abilities.

Emotional Expressions Reinstate Recognition of Other-Race Faces in Infants Following Perceptual Narrowing	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Perceptual narrowing occurs in human infants for other-race faces. A paired-comparison task measuring infant looking time was used to investigate the hypothesis that adding emotional expressiveness to other-race faces would help infants break through narrowing and reinstate other-race face recognition. Experiment 1 demonstrated narrowing for White infants viewing neutral Asian faces: whereas 3-montholds differentiated Asian faces, 6-month-olds did not. Experiment 2 showed that White 6-month-olds differentiated the same Asian faces depicted with angry or happy expressions. Experiments 3 and 4 yielded comparable results for 6- and 9-month-olds tested with Black faces (i.e., narrowing with neutral faces, reinstatement of sensitivity when the faces were presented with emotion). Experiment 5 showed that White 6-month-olds did not differentiate inverted angry or happy Asian faces, and that White 9-month-olds did not differentiate inverted angry or happy Black faces. Looking time during familiarization did not differ for upright neutral and emotional faces, indicating that the expressions did not yield more salient stimuli. Also, consistent with the inversion findings, analyses of the low-level image properties as well as equivalent pairwise similarity ratings obtained from White adults for the neutral and emotional faces indicated that the expressions did not simply create more discriminable stimuli. Without support for the lower-level accounts, we discuss the possibility that the infants processed the communicative intent of the expressions. Because angry faces pose threat and happy faces invite affiliation, expression may create motivation to individuate. Overall, the data suggest that early perceptual-social linkage in face representation can arise via a social-to-perceptual pathway.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				JAN	2020	56	1					15	27		10.1037/dev0000858	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000858								31789529					WOS:000502995100002

The focus of the current study was the impact of traditional versus electronic drawing materials on the quality of children's drawings during the preschool years. Young children (2-5 years, N = 73) and a comparison group of adults (N = 24) copied shapes using three mediums: marker on paper, stylus on touchscreen tablet, finger on touchscreen tablet. Drawings were later deemed codable or uncodable (e.g., scribbles), and codable drawings were then scored for subjective quality on a 4-point scale. Girls and older children (vs. boys and younger children) produced more codable drawings; however, this gap closed when children drew with their finger on a tablet. Medium also affected the quality of adults' drawings, favoring marker on paper. Thus, drawing on a tablet helped younger children produce drawings but resulted in lower quality drawings among adults. These findings underscore the importance of considering environmental constraints on drawing production. Moreover, since clinical assessments often include measures of drawing quality, and sometimes use tablet computers for drawing, these findings have practical implications for education and clinical practice.

While words are the clearest example of this link, they are not the only component of language; morphological regularities (e.g., the plural -s suffix in English) carry meaning as well. Comprehensive theories of language acquisition must account for how infants build links between these other parts of language and their meaning. Here, we investigated the acquisition of morphology in infants learning Italian, a language with a rich inflectional morphology that marks both gender and number on both the article and final vowel of nouns. We demonstrate that infants can build these links between concepts and morphological regularities much earlier than previously thought. Italian-learning 12-18- and 24-month-olds were shown pairs of images of faces that differed either in number (1 female vs. 2 females; 1 male vs. 2 males) or gender (1 female vs. 1 male; 2 females vs. 2 males). On each trial infants were directed to look at one of the images with the morphological regularities as the only distinguishing cue. Overall, across all ages, the infants looked to the labeled image, indicating that they had at least some understanding of the morphology. While infants succeeded on both gender comparisons, they only showed evidence of understanding the feminine number distinction. These results indicate that in the early stages of language acquisition, infants are able to identify recurring morphemes and to map those morphological regularities to the concepts that they mark in the language.

J	Wojcik, EH; Kandhadai, P				Wojcik, Erica H.; Kandhadai, Padmapriya			Paradigmatic Associations and Individual Variability in Early Lexical-Semantic Networks: Evidence From a Free Association Task	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Between 6 and 9 years of age, children's free associations shift from syntagmatic to paradigmatic relationships. Syntagmatic relations are words that are syntactically adjacent, thematically related (summer-vacation), or both; paradigmatic relations are words from the same grammatical class, taxonomic category (summer-winter), or both. Infant researchers have reliably found evidence for the activation of paradigmatic relationships by 24 months. Because of a lack of data from children aged 3 to 5 years, the developmental trajectory of paradigmatic relations is unclear. With age-appropriate stimuli, this work is among the first to collect free association data for children under 5. Children (n = 60; age range = 3-8 years) and adults (n = 60; age range = 18 to 43 years) were instructed to respond to a prime word with the first word that came to mind. Unifying the data from previous studies with infants and older children, our data suggest that paradigmatic relations are present in early childhood but also increase in prevalence with age. Several exploratory analyses revealed that younger children gave more varied responses, suggesting that early lexical-semantic networks are more idiosyncratic. We also found preliminary evidence that responses varied by grammatical class and gender across age groups, with implications for both theory and experimental design. By continuing data collection across the life span and making the dataset public, future work will further elucidate the development of lexical-semantic networks from early childhood onward.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				JAN	2020	56	1					53	69		10.1037/dev0000844	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000844								31670556					WOS:000502995100005
J	Noyes, A; Keil, FC; Dunham, Y				Noyes, Alexander; Keil, Frank C.; Dunham, Yarrow			Institutional Actors: Children's Emerging Beliefs About the Causal Structure of Social Roles	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Institutions make new forms of acting possible: Signing executive orders, scoring goals, and officiating weddings are only possible because of the U.S. government, the rules of soccer, and the institution of marriage. Thus, when an individual occupies a particular social role (president, soccer player, and officiator), they acquire new ways of acting on the world. The present studies investigated children's beliefs about institutional actions, and in particular whether children understand that individuals can only perform institutional actions when their community recognizes them as occupying the appropriate social role. Two studies (Study 1, N = 120 children, ages 4-11; Study 2, N = 90 children, ages 4-9) compared institutional actions to standard actions that do not depend on institutional recognition. In both studies, 4- to 5-year-old children believed all actions were possible regardless of whether an individual was recognized as occupying the social role. In contrast, 8- to 9-year-old children robustly distinguished between institutional and standard actions; they understood that institutional actions depend on collective recognition by a community.

Dangerous and Distinctive Properties Bias Category Judgments Late in Development	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												When faced with entities with potentially ambiguous category membership, adult category judgments are strongly biased toward dangerous and distinctive properties. For example, a cyanide-water mixture is categorized as cyanide. We used a developmental approach to better understand this cross-domain effect, which we term the asymmetric categorization of mixtures (ACM). According to ACM, attention is biased toward perceived dangerous or distinctive properties, making them prominent in conceptual representation. We consider whether ACM is driven entirely by low-level processes of attention, or whether ACM might require the integration of attention with causal-explanatory reasoning. We argue that ACM requires forms of reasoning that only emerge robustly in middle childhood. Across three studies (N = 270), we find that ACM emerges only after the 7th year for liquids (Studies 1 through 3), and even later for race (Studies 1 and 3). Results are discussed in terms of competing theoretical accounts of ACM.

Chinese and South Korean Children's Moral Reasoning Regarding the Fairness of a Gendered Household Labor Distribution	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study explored age-related changes in Chinese and Korean children's fairness judgments and reasoning regarding the gendered division of household labor. The majority of previous research on this issue has focused on adults' experiences and has been conducted in Western countries. Interviews were conducted with 133 children, 65 Chinese and 68 South Korean, ages 9-11 (N = 48), 12-14 (N = 43), and 16-18 (N = 42). Despite country differences in women's involvement in the workforce, in both countries women do most of the housework. Most participants across ages evaluated a hypothetical scenario in which the mother did most of the work as unfair and endorsed a hypothetical scenario in which housework was divided evenly as fair. Developmental effects were found with younger children in both countries employing more equality justifications and adolescents providing more social convention justifications. In both countries, children described their mother as doing most of the housework and, in contrast with their judgments about hypothetical situations, were evenly divided overall in their evaluations of whether this unequal distribution in their actual families was fair. Korean children were more likely to view their family's division as unfair than Chinese children and were more likely to employ equality justifications in support of those judgments. Unexpectedly, across countries moral reasoning in the form of expectations of equity rather than gender stereotyping was employed to justify an unequal division of labor. This study's findings suggest the value of investigating children's fairness judgments and moral reasoning regarding both hypothetical and actual situations.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				JAN	2020	56	1					91	102		10.1037/dev0000854	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000854								31670557					WOS:000502995100008
J	Zhang, Z				Zhang, Zhen			The Impact of Social Relationships on Children's Distributive Justice	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Previous work has provided evidence that both merit and social relationships guide resource distribution in children. However, no prior studies have addressed the question of how children as third-party distributors balance the 2 factors when they are in conflict with one another. Two studies tested 7-year-old Chinese children's allocation of 3 and 4 rewards for work performed by 3 different pairs of recipients. In each pair, 1 recipient was a stranger and the other recipient was either the child's friend, a disliked peer, or another stranger. The 2 recipients were either equally deserving (Study 1, N = 48) or unequally deserving, with the child's friend/disliked peer/another stranger having completed less (Study 2a, N = 48; Follow-Up study, N = 60) or more (Study 2b, N = 48) work to deserve the rewards. The children generally showed a positive bias toward their friend; the children gave more resources to their friend than to an equally deserving stranger (Study 1) and distributed resources equally when the friend was less deserving (Study 2a and Follow-Up combined). The children also showed negative bias toward the disliked peer by distributing resources equally when he or she was more deserving than the stranger (Study 2b). The children adhered to merit when distributing between two strangers (Study 1, 2b, combined Follow-Up). These findings suggest that, by 7 years of age, children resolve conflicts between social relationships and merit by basing resource allocation decisions on relationships, but they moderate those decisions depending on the recipients' merit.						zhang, zhen/0000-0001-9300-0920													0012-1649	1939-0599				JAN	2020	56	1					103	116		10.1037/dev0000855	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000855								31763865					WOS:000502995100009

Religious Testimony in a Secular Society: Belief in Unobservable Entities Among Chinese Parents and Their Children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												When learning about the existence of unobservable scientific phenomena such as germs or religious phenomena such as God, children are receptive to the testimony of other people. Research in Western cultures has shown that by 5 to 6 years of age, children-like adults-are confident about the existence of both scientific and religious phenomena. We examined the beliefs of secular and Christian children growing up in China as well as the beliefs of their parents. All participants-secular and Christian children, as well as their parents-were confident about the existence of the scientific phenomena. No such consensus emerged for religious phenomena. Whereas secular children and their parents were skeptical, Christian children and their parents were confident about the existence of the religious phenomena. Moreover, a similar pattern was found for Christian children in preschools and for Christian children with more extensive exposure to the secular state curriculum. Indeed, for religious phenomena, a positive association was found between the beliefs of Christian children and their parents, highlighting the potential influence of parental input in a predominantly secular society. Overall, the results indicate that children's religious beliefs are related to the beliefs of their parents, even when those beliefs go against the majority view.

Does Prenatal Stress Amplify Effects of Postnatal Maternal Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms on Child Problem Behavior?	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Emerging evidence suggests that prenatal stress does not solely undermine child functioning but increases developmental plasticity to both negative and positive postnatal experiences. Here we test this proposition using the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort study while implementing an extreme-group (i.e., high vs. low prenatal stress) design (n = 27,889 children for internalizing and n = 27,892 for externalizing problems). To measure prenatal stress, mothers reported on depressive and anxiety symptoms at gestational weeks 17 and 30 and of stressful life events at gestational week 30. We then evaluated whether, collectively, such prenatal stress amplified the effect of mothers' postnatal depressive and anxiety symptoms on children's internalizing and externalizing behavior problems at age 5 years. Results showed prenatal stress amplified effects of postnatal maternal depression/anxiety on child internalizing but not externalizing behavior, with some indication that this Prenatal-Stress-X-Postnatal-Maternal-Depression interaction proved more consistent with differential susceptibility than diathesis stress thinking: Children exposed to prenatal stress evinced greater internalizing problems if exposed to more postnatal maternal depressive/anxiety symptoms and, somewhat less strongly, displayed less internalizing problems if they experienced lower postnatal maternal depressive/anxiety symptoms. However, analyses using the whole sample instead of extreme groups yielded opposing results with children exposed to the least prenatal stress evincing greater sensitivity to postnatal maternal depressive/anxiety symptoms with regards to externalizing and internalizing behavior. Taken together, it appears that prenatal stress may have differing effects on plasticity depending on prenatal stress severity.

Exploring Text Messaging as a Platform for Peer Socialization of Social Aggression	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examined whether adolescents' social aggression is socialized through exposure to peers' socially aggressive text messaging. Using data on the socially aggressive content of text messages that 221 participants (M-age = 15.02 years; 46.7% female) sent to and received from peers, and teacher ratings of participants' in-person social aggression, this study found that exposure to peers' socially aggressive texting about out-dyad peers predicted positive changes in adolescents' text-based and in-person social aggression. Gender differences were examined, and results were mixed. In ninth grade, girls sent more socially aggressive text messages than boys; however, by 10th grade, these differences disappeared. Gender differences in adolescents' in-person social aggression and their exposure to peers' socially aggressive texting were nonsignificant at both time points. There was no evidence of gender differences in the links between exposure to peers' socially aggressive texting and adolescents' socially aggressive texting. However, marginal differences were found in the associations between exposure to peers' socially aggressive texting and adolescents' in-person social aggression. Results suggest that texting provides an additional platform for peer socialization of adolescents' social aggression.

Although many studies have examined CMC in adolescents' relationships with friends, few studies have examined the role of CMC in adolescents' renegotiation of closeness and autonomy with parents. To examine this issue, we administered an online daily diary with 169 U.S. adolescents to estimate the time they spend in CMC and FtF interactions and the number of texts they exchange with friends and parents. On the last day of the survey, we asked adolescents about their emotional closeness to friends and parents and their balance of closeness and volition with parents. Overall, we found more evidence for social stimulation than displacement effects of CMC. Texts and CMC time with friends predicted friend closeness after accounting for FtF time with friends; texts with parents predicted parent closeness after accounting for FtF time with parents. We also found support for our hypothesis that CMC would be associated with greater adolescent volition. CMC time with parents predicted greater volitional dependence (volition plus closeness) whereas texts with friends predicted greater independent decision-making (volition plus distance). We discuss how communication technologies are integrated into U.S. adolescents' relationships with friends and parents and how CMC can facilitate, rather than stifle, adolescents' adjustment of autonomy-relatedness with parents and their construction of emotional closeness with friends.

This study examined links between children's family structure trajectories from childhood through adolescence and their timing of entry into cohabitation as young adults, a transition with implications for future relationship instability through adulthood. Repeated measures latent class analysis identified configurations of family structures and family structure changes from birth through age 15 among 10,706 young people in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 Children and Young Adults. A Cox proportional hazard model then used the resulting classes to predict timing into cohabitation over the period from age 15 to age 38. Both timing of family structure transitions and the type of transitions (e.g., early transitioning into a stepfamily home) were associated with earlier entry into cohabitation. Notably, links between family structure trajectories and the timing of cohabitation differed by gender and race/ethnicity (Latinx, African American, White), such as a faster entry into cohabitation by women who experienced early entry into stepfamily structures. Regardless of gender, Latinx and White young adults were faster to enter into cohabitation if they lived in a stepfamily structure during early childhood.

The present longitudinal study examined dynamic relations between religiousness development and self-regulation formation from early adolescence into young adulthood. The sample included 500 U.S. adolescents and their parents. The data were restructured by adolescent age and analyzed from ages 11-22. The analyses involved latent curve models with structured residuals (LCM-SR). First, univariate latent growth curve models were estimated for religiousness, as well as adolescent-reports and parent-reports of adolescent behavioral self-regulation, cognitive self-regulation, and emotional self-regulation. Religiousness decreased over time while self-regulation increased (except for adolescent-report behavioral self-regulation, which followed a u-shape). Bivariate latent growth curve models pairing religiousness with each self-regulation variable found significant positive correlations between change in religiousness and change in adolescent-report cognitive and emotional self-regulation and parent-report emotional self-regulation. After adding in cross-lagged paths, relations between these slopes went away, but positive bidirectional cross-lagged associations in both directions were found between religiousness and adolescent-report cognitive self-regulation and parent-report emotional self-regulation. These results provide evidence for dynamic relations between religiousness and self-regulation across adolescence and into young adulthood. Further, the findings point to possible specificity based on the self-regulation dimension and whether data are adolescent-report or parent-report.

Broadening these theories, the present experiment examined the role of comparison in young infants' reasoning about physical events. We rotated a typical setup of a top-open container 90 degrees such that the opening now faced the side. An object was held vertically aligned with the side opening, enhancing the direct comparison of height. After the object was glided behind or inside the container and became hidden, 5-month-olds detected a height change in both containment and occlusion events. Thus, enhanced support for comparison facilitated young infants' use of key information in physical events (i.e., height in containment events). The finding underscores the importance of considering the role of comparison in the research of intuitive physics in infancy.

J	Huh, M; Friedman, O				Huh, Michelle; Friedman, Ori			Young Children Use Supply and Demand to Infer Desirability	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												In 4 experiments, we show that young children (total N = 290) use information about supply and demand to infer the desirability of resources. In each experiment, children saw scenarios about sandwiches from different shops, which varied in supply (number of sandwiches produced for the day) and demand (number of customers attracted). In Experiments 1 and 2, 5- to 6-year-olds gave higher desirability ratings for sandwiches from shops with greater than lesser demand when supply was held constant. In Experiment 3, 5- to 7-year-olds gave higher desirability ratings for sandwiches from shops with less than more supply when demand was held constant. Finally, in Experiment 4, 5- to 6-year-olds were more likely to judge that sandwiches came from a good shop (rather than from a bad one) when demand exceeded supply than when supply exceeded demand. Together, the findings reveal a way that children can infer how desirable resources are, without needing to incur the costs that would normally be required to obtain and sample the resources themselves.

Sharing Sounds: The Development of Auditory Joint Engagement During Early Parent-Child Interaction	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Joint engagement-the sharing of events during social interactions-is an important context for early learning. To date, sharing topics that are only heard has not been systematically documented. To describe the development of auditory joint engagement, 48 child-parent dyads were observed 5 times from 12 to 30 months during seminaturalistic play. Reactions to 4 types of sounds-overheard speech about the child, instrumental music, animal calls, and mechanical noises-were observed before and as parents scaffolded shared listening and after the sound ceased. Before parents reacted, even 12-month-old infants readily alerted and oriented to the sounds; over time they increasingly tried to share new sounds with their parents. When parents then joined in sharing a sound, periods of auditory joint engagement often ensued, increasing from two thirds of 12-month observations to almost ceiling level at the 18-through 30-month observations. Overall, the developmental course and structure of auditory joint engagement and joint engagement with multimodal objects and events are remarkably similar. Symbol-infused auditory joint engagement occurred rarely at first but increased steadily. Children's labeling of the sound and parents' language scaffolding also increased linearly while child pointing toward it rose until 18 months and then declined. Future studies should address variations in the development of auditory joint engagement, whether autism spectrum disorder affects how toddlers share sounds, and the role auditory joint engagement may play in gestural and language development.

J	Wu, Y; Jobson, L				Wu, Yun; Jobson, Laura			Maternal Reminiscing and Child Autobiographical Memory Elaboration: A Meta-Analytic Review	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Significant research has investigated the relationship between mother-child reminiscing and children's autobiographical memory development. It has been suggested that mothers who adopt a high elaborative reminiscing style tend to have children who provide greater memory elaboration during joint reminiscing, yet the empirical findings are somewhat mixed. To address this issue, a systematic review and meta-analyses were conducted to investigate the relationship between maternal elaborative reminiscing and child autobiographical memory elaboration. Thirty-four cross-sectional and longitudinal studies from peer-reviewed journals and published dissertations were included in the review. Of those, 31 studies had available data for meta-analytic analyses of the maternal reminiscing variables identified in the review. Findings from this study provided strong evidence indicating that high elaborative maternal reminiscing was associated with children's ability to provide greater detailed personal memory, both concurrently and longitudinally. Among maternal elaborative reminiscing elements identified, mothers' open-ended elaboration and positive evaluation were found to be most related to child memory elaboration. More research is needed to identify the effects of sociocultural contexts on the relationship between maternal elaborative reminiscing and child memory elaboration.

Additive relations were found in which more stimulating-responsive interactions with mothers and with caregivers were linked to higher mathematics achievement in childhood and adolescence. More stimulating-responsive early interactions with mothers were also associated with larger child vocabularies through age 15. Synergistic relations, consistent with the dual-risk hypothesis, also were found. Children whose early interactions with both mothers and caregivers were low in stimulation and responsivity had substantially lower mathematics skills. Implications for early childhood interventions and policies are discussed.

Herein, we use an experimental approach to explore for the first time how the same directive instructions ("Do well at the play") have different effects on adolescents depending on the motivational tone of voice used to convey these instructions. A sample of 1,000 adolescents aged 14-15 years was randomly assigned to hearing semantically identical messages that were expressed by mothers of adolescents with controlling, autonomy-supportive, or neutral tones of voice. Results suggest that the way speakers modulated their voice when intoning the same verbal messages affected adolescents' emotional, relational, and behavioral intention responses. Listening to mothers making motivating statements in an autonomy-supportive, relative to a neutral, tone of voice elicited more positive and less negative emotions, increased closeness, and intentional behavioral engagement among adolescents, while the opposite set of findings emerged when adolescents listened to mothers making motivational statements in a controlling tone of voice. These findings elucidate how mothers' spoken communications can impact adolescents, with implications for the quality of parent-child relationships, adolescents' well-being, and engagement.

Longitudinal Associations Between Coparenting and Child Adjustment Among Lesbian, Gay, and Heterosexual Adoptive Parent Families	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This longitudinal study examined coparenting and child adjustment during early and middle childhood (Ms = 3 and 8 years, respectively) among 106 lesbian, gay, and heterosexual parent adoptive families. When children were in middle childhood, no differences emerged as a function of parental sexual orientation in observations or self-reports of coparenting; in addition, parents and teachers described children as well-adjusted overall. After controlling covariates, including couple relationship adjustment, more supportive coparenting in early childhood predicted fewer parent-reported child internalizing and externalizing problems in middle childhood. Within middle childhood, stronger parenting alliance was associated with fewer parent-reported child externalizing problems. These findings indicate the value of considering family processes among diverse families in contributing to child outcomes over time.

Selection and Socialization Effects of Impulse Control	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Personality traits are well-known predictors of academic success across all levels of education. However, whether school provides an environment to cultivate and promote personality traits is largely unknown. Theories about personality development give reasons to assume that enduring experiences at school could lead to prolonged personality changes. We therefore studied the dynamic interplay of impulse control-an important predictor for educational and life outcomes-and perceptions of school-related experiences both in terms of selection and socialization effects. We used a large, representative, longitudinal dataset of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth following students from ages 10 to 21 across 6 assessment waves to examine mutual associations of impulse control and school-related experiences across middle and high school years. Sample sizes for the analyses ranged from 8,204 to 8,421 (51% male). Mutual associations between perceived school-related experiences and impulse control were analyzed using random intercept cross-lagged panel models. Results supported the appearance of selection and, to a lesser extent, socialization effects for impulse control and some school-related experiences. The results point to the importance of school-related experiences not limited to academic matters.

Serum Cholesterol, <i>MTHFR</i> Methylation, and Symptoms of Depression in Children	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Depression is associated with dietary factors and epigenetics. Serum cholesterol, which is prone to dietary influences, has been linked to symptoms of depression. This relationship may be (in part) due to altered epigenetic regulation of Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (MTHFR). MTHFR codes for the MTHFR enzyme, which has diverse metabolic functions, and has recently been linked individually with diet, serum cholesterol levels and depressive symptoms. In 514 mother-child pairs, we examined prospective relationships between maternal (pregnancy) and child (7 years) serum cholesterol, MTHFR DNA methylation (DNAm; birth, 7 years), and development of depression symptoms from 8-15 years. After adjusting for potential confounding, we had three main findings. First, higher prenatal cholesterol associated (at a small effect size) with higher MTHFR DNAm at birth. Second, there was small effect size continuity for MTHFR DNAm between birth and age 7. Third, higher age 7 MTHFR DNAm associated with higher initial symptoms of depression symptoms at age 8, again at a small effect size. Overall, our findings provide preliminary evidence for a relationship between prenatal cholesterol, MTHFR DNAm, and symptoms of depression in children.

J	Wolf, S				Wolf, Sharon			Year 3 Follow-Up of the 'Quality Preschool for Ghana' Interventions on Child Development	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Governments around the world are increasing investments in early childhood education as a way to promote children's learning and development. As research grows on the longer-term effects of early educational programs, some have hypothesized that sustained impacts may depend on the quality of children's subsequent classroom environments and may be more likely to occur in certain nonacademic domains. This study is the first to examine these questions in sub-Saharan Africa, using longitudinal data from a school-randomized trial in Ghana. A 1-year teacher-training and coaching program, delivered with (TTPA) and without (TT) parental-awareness meetings, was implemented when children were enrolled in 1 of 2 grades of preprimary school. Previous studies showed that in Year 1, the implementation year, the TT treatment had positive impacts on children's literacy, numeracy, and social-emotional development, while the TTPA treatment yielded no positive impacts for children in both grades. In this study, I examine impacts in Year 3, at the end of children's 1st or 2nd year of primary school. I find persistent positive impacts of TT on literacy, and new negative impacts of TTPA on numeracy, but these depend on levels of classroom emotional support and teacher burnout in primary school. In addition, there were small persistent impacts of both treatments on children's executive function, and these were not conditional on subsequent classroom environments.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				DEC	2019	55	12					2587	2602		10.1037/dev0000843	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000843								31657587					WOS:000497756200010

The Role of Testimony in Children's Moral Decision Making: Evidence From China and United States	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												What does it take know a moral truth or principle? Although testimony is an undisputed source of empirical knowledge of contingent facts, it is less clear whether it is possible to acquire "second-hand moral knowledge" (Jones, 1999; Wolff, 1998). In the present studies, 3- to 5-year-old Chinese (N = 124) and U.S. American (N = 90) children were asked to judge whether novel, distress-inducing actions were morally permissible, both independently and after either 1 or 3 adult informants had made counterintuitive judgments. Although participants made appropriate moral judgments independently, children from both countries were affected by the counterintuitive testimony provided by the adult informant(s). Moreover, Chinese children were especially receptive to such counterintuitive claims. These findings demonstrate that intuitive moral judgments based on perceived harm are common across 2 cultural groups, but adult testimony can potentially shift those judgments.

Implications of Chinese and American Mothers' Goals for Children's Emotional Distress	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This research examined a cultural socialization model in which differences in Chinese and American parents' goals for children foster differences in children's emotional distress via parents' responses to children's performance. Chinese and American mothers and their children (N = 397; M-age = 13.19 years) participated in a 2-wave study spanning a year. Mothers reported on their self-improvement (i.e., children striving to improve) and self-worth (i.e., children feeling worthy) goals, as well as responses to children's performance. Children reported on their emotional distress (e.g., anxiety and depression). Chinese (vs. American) mothers' greater endorsement of self-improvement goals predicted their more frequent use of failure-oriented responses (e.g., highlighting children's mistakes), which accounted for Chinese (vs. American) children's heightened emotional distress over time.

Being Observed Increases Overimitation in Three Diverse Cultures	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												From a young age, children in Western, industrialized societies overimitate others' actions. However, the underlying motivation and cultural specificity of this behavior have remained unclear. Here, 3- to 8-year-old children (N = 125) from two rural Namibian populations (Haillom and Ovambo) and one urban German population were tested in two versions of an overimitation paradigm. Across cultures, children selectively imitated more actions when the adult model was present compared to being absent, denoting a social motivation underlying overimitation. At the same time, children's imitation was not linked to their tendency to reengage the adult in a second, independent measure of social motivation. These results suggest that, across diverse cultures, children's imitative behavior is actuated by the attentive state of the model.

Peer Support Development Among Black American and Latinx Adolescents: The Role of Ethnic-Racial Centrality	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Adolescence is a developmental period when youth are increasingly likely to turn to their peers for support, and it is also a time of increased salience and development of ethnic-racial identity (ERI). Ethnic-racial centrality, a dimension of ERI, could be a predictor in the development of peer support, as youth with a stronger self-concept on the basis of their ethnic-racial identity might garner stronger peer relations. The current study examined trajectories of academic and emotional peer support as well as the role of centrality of one's ethnic-racial identity (i.e., ethnic-racial centrality) in predicting such trajectories among Black American and Latinx adolescents (N = 143, M-age = 11.91). Average levels of both academic and emotional peer support did not change over time. However, greater ethnic-racial centrality was positively related to higher initial levels of academic and emotional peer support. Ethnic-racial centrality as a potential asset for youth of color in the development of peer support is discussed.

Maintaining and Attaining Educational Expectations: A Two-Cohort Longitudinal Study of Hispanic Youth	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Hispanic adolescents have high expectations for their own educational attainment, but educational attainment outcomes for Hispanic young adults are relatively low on average. Limited scholarship links Hispanic adolescents' educational expectations with attainment in adulthood. Using a longitudinal within-group approach, the authors examined changes in Hispanic adolescents' educational expectations from 10th to 12th grade as well as the discrepancy between educational expectations and later attainment in 2 cohorts (N = 1,372 and N = 1,521). Based on national surveys approximately 12 years apart (NELS:88 and ELS:02), expectations of a college degree became more common for Hispanic adolescents. Most Hispanic young adults attained less education than they expected, and this expectations-attainment gap grew over time, consistent with U.S. national trends. Parent education was positively associated with attaining expectations, and family income became more important for attaining expectations over time. Consistent with the immigrant paradox and immigrant optimism hypothesis, second-generation youth came closer to attaining their expectations than third- or higher-generation youth of equal positioning. Educational expectations and attainment patterns also varied by cohort: for instance, immigrants in the more recent cohort had an absolute disadvantage in terms of attaining their expectations compared with their other-generation counterparts. Finally, parental involvement in education (e.g., parents' educational aspirations) was associated with educational expectations and attainment outcomes. This study advances knowledge of factors that contribute to maintaining and attaining educational expectations for Hispanic youth and how these factors have changed over time. Study results inform efforts to support Hispanic adolescents' and young adults' educational potential.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				DEC	2019	55	12					2649	2664		10.1037/dev0000820	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000820								31512897					WOS:000497756200015

This study examined whether adolescent personality moderates the associations between parental psychological control and internalizing and externalizing problems at the level of within-person change. A 3-wave longitudinal design (N = 198 families, Mage adolescent = 14.89 years, Mage mother = 45.14 years, Mage father = 46.79 years), with 1-year intervals between waves, and using multi-informant assessment was conducted. Multilevel analyses demonstrated that changes in parental psychological control related positively to changes in multi-informant scores of both internalizing and externalizing problems. Evidence for the moderating role of personality was found for only 1 out of 25 interactions in a variable-centered approach and for 2 out of 8 interactions in a person-centered approach. The interactions obtained indicated that a mature personality (i.e., higher scores on emotional stability or membership in a resilient profile in comparison to an overcontrolled profile) buffered against the detrimental effects of psychologically controlling parenting on problem behaviors. Overall, the number of interactions was limited, suggesting only a modest moderating effect of adolescent personality.

A Longitudinal Examination of the Association Between Intelligence and Rearrest Using a Latent Trait-State-Occasion Modeling Approach in a Sample of Previously Adjudicated Youth	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Recidivism remains a serious issue in the modern criminal justice system, with over 80% of those previously incarcerated being rearrested within 9 years of release (Alper, Durose, & Markman, 2018). Although previous studies have identified risk factors that increase the probability of rearrest, much remains unknown regarding the full constellation of risk factors. One potential risk factor that has received limited attention is intelligence, as individuals with lower IQ scores have been found to be more likely to come into initial contact with the criminal justice system. Collectively, previous studies have provided preliminary evidence of intelligence as a risk factor for rearrest but have not fully explored this association. More specifically, it remains unclear whether the association between IQ and recidivism persists after controlling for time-invariant, individual-specific sources of variance in criminal behavior. The current study aimed to address this limitation and more closely examine the longitudinal association between IQ and rearrest with data from the Pathways to Desistance Study (N = 1,331 individuals). To distinguish variance in intelligence from time-stable, individual-specific variance in criminality, we estimated a latent trait-state-occasion model. A subsequent series of survival models, which included the previously estimated measure of criminality as a covariate, revealed a small and negative association between IQ and rearrest (hazard ratio = .95; 95% confidence interval [.92;.98]), suggesting that IQ may play only a minor role in recidivism.

Perceiving Gratitude From a Romantic Partner Predicts Decreases in Attachment Anxiety	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Attachment anxiety is a form of attachment insecurity characterized by chronic worries about rejection and need for reassurance. Given the critical role a sense of security plays in maintaining healthy relationships, individuals high in attachment anxiety tend to struggle in romantic relationships, which carries serious implications for their broader physical and psychological well-being. Nevertheless, an individual's attachment anxiety continues to change throughout life and can be downregulated by later relationship environments. In this research, we used 7-year longitudinal data (n = 2,057) to examine 1 potential predictor of declines in attachment anxiety in an established romantic relationship: perceiving gratitude from a partner. Random intercept cross-lagged panel analyses supported our prediction that perceiving higher than typical levels of gratitude from a romantic partner was linked with reduced attachment anxiety at that time and, importantly, the following year. These results were independent of the individual's fluctuations in global relationship satisfaction, suggesting the unique power of gratitude. Our findings provide strong evidence that later interpersonal environments can indeed shape an individual's attachment anxiety.

Individual differences in nonlinguistic event categorization are related to children's later verb comprehension (Konishi, Stahl, Golinkoff, & Hirsh-Pasek, 2016). We asked: (a) Do infants learning Turkish, a verb-framed language, attend to both manner and path changes in motion events? (b) Is early detection of path and manner related to children's later verb comprehension and (c) how they describe motion events? Thirty-two Turkish-reared children were tested at three time points. At Time 1, infants (M-age = 14.5 months) were tested on their detection of changes in path and manner using the Preferential Looking Paradigm. At Time 2, children were tested on their receptive language skills (M-age = 22.07 months). At Time 3, children performed 3 tasks (M-age = 35.05 months): a verb comprehension task, an event description task depicting motion events with different path and manner combinations, and an expressive language task. The ability to detect changes in event components at Time 1 predicted verb comprehension abilities at Time 3, beyond general receptive and expressive vocabulary skills at Times 2 and 3. Infants who noticed changes in path and manner at Time 1 used fewer manner-only descriptions and more path-any descriptions (i.e., descriptions that included a path component with or without manner) in their speech at Time 3. These findings suggest that early detection of event components is associated not only with verb comprehension, but also with how children lexicalize event components in line with their native language.

Malleability of Whole-Number and Fraction Biases in Decimal Comparison	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Children and adults often have difficulties comparing decimal magnitudes. Although individuals attempt to reconcile decimals with prior whole-number and fraction knowledge, conceptual and procedural differences between decimals and prior knowledge of whole numbers and fractions can lead to incorrect strategies. The dynamic strategy choice account has proposed that saliency, recency, prior knowledge, and other factors contribute to strategy use when reasoning about decimals. We experimentally tested this theory using a priming technique to manipulate the saliency of different strategies prior to completion of a decimal magnitude comparison task. We hypothesized that whole-number priming (practicing whole-number comparisons with feedback) would increase whole-number bias in decimal comparisons (treating decimals with more digits as larger in magnitude), whereas fraction priming would increase fraction bias (treating decimals with fewer digits as larger in magnitude). We also explored participants' performance in decimal comparisons after being primed by decimal comparisons with feedback. Sixth to eighth graders (N = 149) and adults (N = 175) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 priming conditions: whole-number, fraction, decimal, or a control (flanker) task. Participants first completed numerical magnitude comparisons according to their priming condition (or control task) with feedback, then all conditions completed decimal comparisons without feedback. In both children and adults, fraction priming significantly reduced whole-number bias compared with the control. Among children, fraction priming significantly increased fraction bias. Moreover, children's performance in the control and whole-number-priming conditions was characterized by strong whole-number bias, but in the decimal-priming condition, relatively brief feedback substantially improved decimal comparison performance.

Different orthographies present readers with somewhat different problems to solve, and this might, in turn, be reflected in different patterns of development of reading skill. Participants of different developmental levels (Grade 3, N = 30; Grade 5, N = 27 and adults, N = 27) were instructed to read sentences for comprehension while their eye movements were recorded. Contrary to previous findings that have been well documented indicating early maturation of saccade generation in English, current results showed that saccade generation among Chinese readers was still under development at Grade 5, although immediate lexical processing was relatively well-established. The distinct age-related changes in eye movements are attributable to certain linguistic properties of Chinese including the lack of interword spaces and word boundary uncertainty. The present study offers an example of how human eye movement adapts to the orthographic environment.

Owners can thus trust others to respect their property even in their absence. We investigated this principle in 5- to 7-year-olds (N = 152) from 4 diverse societies. Children participated in a resource task with a peer-partner, where we established ownership by assigning children to one side or the other of an apparatus and by marking resources with colors to help children keep track of them. When retrieving resources in the partner's presence, the majority of children took their own things and respected what belonged to their partner. A proportion of children in all societies also respected ownership in their partner's absence, although the strength of respect varied considerably across societies. We discuss implications for the development of ownership concepts and possible explanations for societal differences.

Children's developmental shift from viewing inequality as a dichotomous moral issue toward a more nuanced understanding of partial inequality has been well documented across middle childhood and is attributed to a host of potential theoretical underpinnings, including developing number concept, increased regard for one's social status, and a maturing concept of fairness. The current study examined the electrophysiological markers associated with children's (N = 83; 4 to 8 years of age) third-party evaluations of equal, slightly unequal, and extremely unequal resource distributions, documenting the timing of fairness considerations. It further explored the link between individual differences in these neural computations and children's allocation behaviors and judgments. Event-related potentials demonstrated an early differentiation between equality and any type of inequality reflected by a medial frontal negativity. Later (after 500 ms), extreme inequality was discriminated from equality and slight inequality. Differences in later waveforms predicted sharing and third-party contextual resource distributions, accounting for wealth and merit. These results illuminate the multifaceted nature of developing neural computations of fairness and illustrate the value of a multiple levels of analysis approach in contributing theoretical clarity toward the developmental science of moral cognition and behavior.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				NOV	2019	55	11					2299	2310		10.1037/dev0000813	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000813								31436460					WOS:000492783100005

Becoming More Egalitarian: A Longitudinal Examination of Mexican-Origin Adolescents' Gender Role Attitudes	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The current study examined the trajectory of gender role attitudes of 471 Mexican-origin adolescents (236 girls, 235 boys) from 5th grade (M-age = 10.86 years) to 11th grade (M-age = 16.75 years), investigating how situating identities (i.e., gender, nativity, SES), ethnic identity (i.e., ethnic pride), and familial context (i.e., parents' attitudes) contributed to adolescents' gender role attitudes across time. Participant interviews were conducted every other year, resulting in 4 waves of data. Most parents (96%) were Mexico natives, with an average immigration age of 18.16 years for fathers and 14.01 years for mothers. Results revealed linear and quadratic trends in gender attitude traditionality for all adolescents, characterized by a linear decline through age 16 years that leveled off through age 18 years. Although both girls and boys trended toward egalitarian gender role attitudes across adolescence, girls endorsed more egalitarian attitudes than did boys. Adolescents from higher-SES backgrounds endorsed more egalitarian attitudes than those from lower-SES backgrounds. Significant within-person effects of ethnic pride surfaced, such that children with higher levels of ethnic pride at any given time also reported more traditional gender role attitudes. Significant between-person effects of mothers' and fathers' attitudes were found, such that parents with more traditional gender role attitudes tended to have children with relatively more traditional gender role attitudes. Overall, these findings highlight the importance of studying gender development in conjunction with situating identities, cultural identities, and the broader context, particularly when children are embedded in multiple cultures with contrasting gender role expectations.

Often it is in hierarchically structured interactions with parents or other adults, but sometimes it is in more symmetrically structured interactions with peers. Our question was whether children's discussions of moral norms differ in these two contexts. Consequently, we had 4- and 6-year-old children (N = 72) reason about moral dilemmas with their mothers or peers. Both age groups opposed their partner's views and explicitly justified their own views more often with peers than with mothers. Mothers adapted their discussions to the cognitive levels of their children (e.g., focused more on the abstract moral norms with 6-year-old children than with 4-year-old children), but almost always with a pedagogical intent. Our results suggest that with mothers, moral judgments are experienced mostly as non-negotiable dictums, but with coequal peers they are experienced more as personal beliefs that can be actively negotiated.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				NOV	2019	55	11					2324	2335		10.1037/dev0000807	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000807								31512895					WOS:000492783100007

Sex differences were largely absent except for one, where fathers' psychological control predicted adolescent females', but not males', declines in self-regulation, and where reverse associations manifested.

RET facilitates elaborative and emotionally supportive parent-child communication, which is an essential component of the parent-child relationship and is especially relevant for the preschool age period. Participants were 248 children between the ages of 3- to 6-years-old and their mothers. Following a baseline assessment, 165 maltreating families were randomized into RET or a Community Standard (CS) condition in which families received case management and written parenting information; 83 families participated in the nonmaltreating comparison condition. Results indicated that the key mechanisms targeted by the RET interventions were enhanced, such that mothers who participated in RET were significantly better in elaboration and sensitive guidance during reminiscing at the posttest than were maltreating mothers who did not receive the intervention, with medium to large effect sizes; additionally, mothers in the RET group were more elaborative than mothers from the nonmaltreatment group. Children in the RET condition also contributed significantly more memories and had better emotional knowledge than did children in the CS condition, controlling for baseline values and language, and approximated the functioning of nonmaltreated children. These findings add to a growing literature underscoring the benefits of brief, focused, relational interventions for maltreated children and their caregivers.

Specifically, we examined stability and change in secure base script knowledge during middle childhood using a sample of 157 children (Wave 1 mean age [M-age] = 10.91, standard deviation [SD] = 0.87) assessed at 1-year intervals across 4 waves. Secure base script knowledge was moderately stable over time, as script scores were significantly correlated between each wave. We also investigated the impact of life stress on change in secure base script knowledge within individuals across waves. The results demonstrated that daily hassles (minor and frequently occurring stressful life events) but not major (more severe and infrequent) stressful life events predicted change in script knowledge. Implications for attachment-based interventions and, more broadly, the stability of attachment security are discussed.

This study provides evidence for the validity of behaviorally observed Environmental Sensitivity as a moderator of parenting effects on children's early development in a sample of 292 children (Mage = 3.74; SD = 0.26) and their mothers. Sensitivity was coded using a newly developed observational measure for the specific and objective assessment of Environmental Sensitivity, the Highly Sensitive Child-Rating System (HSC-RS). HSC-RS factorial structure, associations with temperament traits, and interactions with parenting quality in the prediction of socioemotional child outcomes are reported. Findings supported a 1-factor solution. Observed sensitivity was relatively distinct from observed temperament and interacted with both low and high parenting quality in the development of behavior problems and social competence at ages 3 and 6.

In addition, little is known about how genetic and environmental factors affect this relationship during middle childhood. We addressed these gaps by applying a quantitative genetic analysis to cross-lagged associations between mothers' and fathers' parental negativity and children's NE during middle childhood. The sample comprised of 456 families when the children were 6.5 years old, and 401 families when the children were 8/9 years old. Mothers' and fathers' negativity and children's NE were assessed using questionnaires. Results showed that variation in parental negativity was mainly accounted for by the environment shared by children, with some indication of an evocative effect of the children's genes on mothers, but not fathers. Children's NE was accounted for by both genetic and shared environmental influences. Parental negativity and children's NE had moderate continuity over the course of two years. Mothers' (but not fathers') negativity when the children were 6.5 years old predicted change in children's NE (rated by the same or the other parent) toward age 8/9 years, but not the other way around. Shared environmental influences were the main contributor to the association between earlier mothers' negativity and later children's NE. Thus, although children's NE was partially heritable, and parenting too was partially accounted for by children's genes, the association between parental negativity and children's NE, at this age, reflects environmental effects and is compatible with mothers' influence on children.

Early Positive Parenting and Maternal Depression History Predict Children's Relational Binding Ability at School-Age	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Research has indicated age-related improvements in relational binding, an important process of episodic memory, across development. However, little research has focused on individual differences in relational binding and factors contributing to this variation. Although differences may arise from various sources, early caregiving has been shown to impact aspects of memory related to relational binding and also the hippocampus, a structure critical to binding. The present study investigated the influences of early and concurrent parenting and maternal lifetime depression history on children's ability to successfully bind details and retain this information across a delay. A total of 97 children are included in this report. Children were part of a longitudinal study with testing at preschool age (Time 1: 3-5 years) and school age (Time 2: approximately 3 years later). At both time points, positive and negative parenting behaviors were assessed during observational parenting tasks and maternal depression history was assessed with a clinical interview. At Time 2, a composite binding score was derived from two episodic memory tasks: a source memory task and a feature binding task. Findings indicated that early positive parenting predicted higher binding scores later in childhood whereas maternal depression was associated with lower scores. These results were robust even after taking into account child age, general cognitive ability, race, and parental education. These findings highlight 2 factors related to the caregiving environment, parenting and maternal depression, that contribute to individual differences in children's relational binding ability and underscore the importance of early experience on episodic memory development.

Children's Peer Beliefs, Friendlessness, and Friendship Quality: Reciprocal Influences and Contributions to Internalizing Symptoms	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Children's peer beliefs have been shown to mediate the link between stress experienced within the peer group and later internalizing symptoms. This study extends this research by examining bidirectional associations between children's peer beliefs, friendlessness, and perceived friendship quality (i.e., receiving provision, negative treatment) and identifying indirect pathways to internalizing symptoms. Participants (N = 366; M-age = 9.34 years, SD = .07; 196 girls) reported on their peer beliefs, classroom friendships, friendship quality, and internalizing symptoms at 3 time points across 1 calendar year. Receiving provision from friends predicted less negative peer beliefs. Negative peer beliefs predicted less received provisions from friends and higher levels of negative treatment, and, in turn, negative treatment from friends predicted higher levels of internalizing symptoms. These findings provide novel insights into how perceptions of the peer group relate to dyad-level relationship processes, including the potential contribution of peer beliefs to children's peer adjustment.

The sample (N = 246) consisted of African American (n = 115) and European American (n = 131) children and adolescents who judged the likelihood of including a new peer, evaluated the group's decision to exclude the new peer, and provided reasons for their judgments. European American participants, particularly adolescents, viewed same-race inclusion as more likely than interracial inclusion. In contrast, African American participants viewed interracial and same-race inclusion to be just as likely, and evaluated all forms of exclusion to be more wrong than did their European American counterparts. The findings are discussed with respect to peer messages about interracial peer encounters and the conditions that are necessary for prejudice reduction.

The Interrelated Effects of Parents, Peers, Classrooms on Development of Prejudice Among Swedish Majority Adolescents	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Prejudice is one of the major threats to the cohesion of multicultural societies and adolescent years play a key role in its development. How social contexts contribute to adolescent prejudice is, however, not yet well-known. This 3-wave study of Swedish majority adolescents (N = 659; M-ageT1 = 13.41; M-ageT3 = 17.33) examined the effects of parents' and peers' attitudes on changes in youth attitudes toward immigrants as well as an interplay between parent, peer, and school context. The results of multilevel analyses revealed that within-person fluctuations in youth attitudes were positively related to fluctuations in peers' but not parents' attitudes. Both parents' and peers' attitudes, however, significantly predicted the differences in level and rate of change in attitudes between adolescents. In addition to these direct effects, mediation analysis showed that parents' attitudes predicted youth attitudes indirectly, via the attitudes of the peers youth associate with, suggesting an overall greater importance of parental bias. Peers' attitudes did not moderate the effects of parents but youth from ethnically diverse classrooms were less affected by their parents' prejudice than youth from less diverse classrooms. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of social context in the development of prejudice. They suggest that while parents set the stage, peers explain the day-to-day variation in prejudice, and that classroom diversity offsets some of the negative effects of parental bias.

Longitudinal Socioemotional Pathways Between Retrospective Early Life Maternal Relationship Quality and Episodic Memory in Older Adulthood	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Prior research suggests that social relations may play a role in explaining individual differences in cognitive functioning in older adulthood. In particular, early life maternal relationship quality (MRQ) has been shown to be a strong predictor of later-life socioemotional outcomes and may also contribute to later-life cognitive outcomes. The current study aimed to examine longitudinal associations between retrospective early life MRQ and later-life episodic memory directly and indirectly through socioemotional pathways. Three waves of data spanning 6 years of the Health and Retirement Study were used (T1: 2008, T2: 2012, T3: 2014; n = 5,263, M-age = 69.31, SD = 10.75 at T1). A longitudinal mediation model tested the direct and indirect effects of retrospectively reported MRQ at T1 on T2 memory and latent change in memory from T2 to T3 through depressive symptoms, social network size, and loneliness at T2. Analyses revealed that better MRQ at T1 was associated with less loneliness and fewer depressive symptoms at T2, and in turn, each was independently associated with less decline in memory from T2 to T3. Overall, findings suggest an enduring effect of early life social experiences on later-life cognitive functioning through socioemotional pathways. These findings further highlight the necessity of taking an integrative and life course perspective when examining the relationship between social relations and cognition.					Kraal, A.

Typically, the association is analyzed by variants of the classical cross-lagged panel model. Results with more recently developed methodological approaches, for example, the random intercept cross-lagged panel model, its continuous-time implementation, and the latent change score model, are not available so far. The present study aimed to test the association between reading self-concept and reading achievement with different models to evaluate whether positive cross-lagged effects can be demonstrated with the alternative models. Drawing on a sample of 2,014 elementary students from Grade 1 to Grade 4, results of alternative models yielded noticeable differences. Support for reciprocal effects between reading self-concept and reading achievement was found using the classical and the full-forward cross-lagged panel models. No such effects were found in the other models. Thus, the reciprocal effect model can be called into question for elementary schoolchildren. The results are discussed with regard to the theoretical assumptions and appropriate methodological approaches.

Electrophysiological Evidence for the Emergence of Body-Related Cortical Processing in the First 14 Months of Life	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												There is general consensus that the representation of the human face becomes functionally specialized within the first few months of an infant's life. The literature is divided, however, on the question whether the specialized representation of the remainder of the human body form follows a similarly rapid trajectory or emerges more slowly and in line with domain-general learning mechanisms. Our study investigates visual event-related potentials (ERPs) in adults (P1 and N170) and infants (P1, N290, P400, and Nc) of 3 age groups (3.5, 10, and 14 months) to compare the emergence of face-and body-structural encoding. Our findings show that visual ERPs were absent (P1, N290, P400) or smaller (Nc) for bodies than for faces at 3.5 months. At older ages, P400 was smaller (10 months) and peaked later (14 months) for bodies than for faces. Effects of stimulus orientation were not reliably found until 14 months, where they were more broadly distributed for faces than for bodies. Inverted faces, but not bodies, produced an adult-like pattern for P400 at 14 months, emphasizing the role of P400 as the precursor of the adult N170. Importantly, our findings argue that structural encoding of the human body form emerges later in infancy and is qualitatively different from the structural encoding for faces. This is commensurate with infant motor development and the experience of viewing complete body shapes later than faces.

Toddlers are sensitive to disagreements, and they can track several kinds of informational access, such as visual perception. We investigated whether young children use these skills (a) when assessing whether providing reasons is needed and (b) when selecting appropriate behaviors to support their claims. An experimenter disagreed with 2- to 4-year-old children (N = 71) about the location of a toy placed in 1 of 4 boxes. In the fully transparent condition, the boxes were transparent, and the toy was visible to the experimenter and to the participant. In the window condition, the boxes were partially opaque, and the toy was initially hidden from the experimenter but visible to the participant through a transparent window. In this condition, toddlers could make the toy visible to the experimenter by rotating the baited box. Participants in the window condition were more likely to rotate the baited box than those in the transparent condition. Thus, children were more likely to rotate the box when this action was an efficient way of supporting their claims by revealing new and relevant information to the experimenter. These results demonstrate the presence of precursors of crucial skills required for reason-giving and reveal that from 2 years of age, children do not use fixed persuasion strategies. Instead, they select relevant evidence when attempting to influence others.

DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The current study investigates whether informative, mutually redundant audiovisual cues support better performance in a category learning paradigm. Research suggests that, under some conditions, redundant multisensory cues supports better learning, when compared with unisensory cues. This was examined systematically across two experiments. In Experiment 1, children aged 5, 7, and 10 years were allocated to 1 of the 3 "modality" conditions (audio informative only, visual informative only, and audiovisual informative) and explicitly instructed to learn the category membership of individual exemplars, as determined by a threshold of correct responses. Unisensory or redundant multisensory cues determined category membership, depending on the learning condition. In addition to significant main effects of age group and condition, a significant interaction between age and sensory condition was found, with 5-year-olds performing better when presented with redundant multisensory cues compared to unisensory cues. Ten-year-olds performed better with auditory informative only cues, compared to visual informative only cues, or informative but redundant multisensory cues, with no significant difference between the latter two. In Experiment 2, the multisensory condition was presented to separate groups of 5-, 7-, and 10-year-olds, examining explicit learning outcomes in the audiovisual informative condition. Results showed that children who reached threshold during training were faster, made fewer errors, and performed better during test trials. Learning appeared to be based on the visual informative cues. Findings are discussed in the context of age-related selective attention, suggesting that the value of providing multisensory informative cues to support real-world learning depends on age and instructional context.

J	Blanco, NJ; Sloutsky, VM				Blanco, Nathaniel J.; Sloutsky, Vladimir M.			Adaptive Flexibility in Category Learning? Young Children Exhibit Smaller Costs of Selective Attention Than Adults	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Previous research has shown that when learning categories, adults and young children allocate attention differently. Adults tend to attend selectively, focusing primarily on the most relevant information, whereas young children tend to distribute their attention broadly. Although selective attention is useful in many situations, it also has costs. In addition to ignoring information that may turn out to be useful later, selective attention can have long-term costs, such as learned inattention-ignoring formerly irrelevant sources of information in novel situations. In 2 reported experiments, adults and 4-year-old children completed a category learning task in which an unannounced shift occurred such that information that was most relevant became irrelevant, whereas formerly irrelevant information became relevant. Costs stemming from this shift were assessed. The results indicate that adults exhibit greater costs due to learned inattention than young children. Distributing attention may be adaptive in young children, making them flexible to changing contingencies in the world and facilitating broad information gathering, both of which are useful when general knowledge about the environment is limited.

The Role of Children's Metacognitive Experiences for Cue Utilization and Monitoring Accuracy: A Longitudinal Study	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Although the literature consistently documents strong improvements in metacognitive skills over the elementary school years, relatively little is known about the mechanisms fueling these developments. One factor that is being discussed in the literature and targeted in the present approach is cue utilization. Cue utilization quantifies the degree to which an individual uses mnemonic experiences during task mastery to inform monitoring processes. In the present study, retrieval fluency as a valid and ubiquitous cue during recognition was assessed by recording children's choice latencies in a recognition test and by relating these to confidence ratings. A sample of second graders and fourth graders was assessed 3 times over one year in terms of their recognition performance, the time needed to select an alternative, and their monitoring accuracy. Results revealed age differences in monitoring accuracy, cue utilization, and cue validity. Moreover, while monitoring accuracy increased over time in both age groups, cue utilization increased only in the younger children. Analyses were completed by an individual differences approach showing that cue utilization is a factor driving recognition improvements over time, underlining the importance of metacognitive experiences for development.					van Loon, Mariette/A-7209-2014; Mayer, Boris/D-1222-2011	van Loon, Mariette/0000-0003-3040-7867; Mayer, Boris/0000-0003-2597-6707													0012-1649	1939-0599				OCT	2019	55	10					2077	2089		10.1037/dev0000776	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000776								31343230					WOS:000488053500005

To investigate adolescents' competence development in applying problem-solving strategies in complex environments, we conducted a 2-wave longitudinal study in a sample of Finnish adolescents (11-17 years old; N = 1,959 at Time 1 and N = 1,690 at Time 2, 3 years later). In this study, we aimed to: (a) determine the optimal number of strategy use profiles while solving complex problems, (b) determine the number of meaningful developmental paths for each profile, and (c) test the impact of reasoning abilities and learning-related motivational beliefs on the probability that an adolescent with a given strategy use profile will take a given developmental path. Using latent transition analysis, we found 4 meaningful strategy use profiles: Proficient Explorers, Rapid Learners, Emerging Explorers, and Low-Performing Explorers. Forty-three percent of the participants were classified as having the same strategy use profile in Time 1 and Time 2. The strategy use of 34% was assessed as having improved between Time 1 and Time 2, while that of 21% was assessed as having declined between Time 1 and Time 2. Verbal reasoning ability and learning-related motivational beliefs predicted whether the developmental path of Emerging Explorers' was more likely to remain stable, improve, or decline over time.

Reparative Prosocial Behaviors Alleviate Children's Guilt	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Guilt theoretically functions to motivate reparative behaviors, which, in turn, theoretically alleviate guilt and prevent depression. Although empirical research supports these theories in adults, studies have not investigated causal relations between guilt and reparative behaviors in children. Thus, this study examined whether guilt motivates children's reparative behaviors, and whether their reparative behaviors successfully alleviate guilty feelings. Six-to 10-year olds (N = 97) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions. Children in the experimental condition were led to believe they had transgressed to cause a peer's distress. Children self-reported their guilt following the transgression, and then had the opportunity to repair the transgression by giving stickers and writing a note to the victimized peer. Following the repair opportunity, children self-reported their guilt a second time. Children in the experimental condition (i.e., children who felt guilty) engaged in greater reparative behavior than children in a no-guilt condition who were led to believe they had caused a peer's slightly positive emotions. Further, children in the experimental condition reported reduced guilt across the first to second guilt measurement, whereas children in the no-repair condition (who transgressed but did not have a repair opportunity) did not report reduced guilt over time. Results demonstrate that guilt and reparative behaviors function as theorized in middle childhood and may begin to inform reparative interventions aimed at preventing maladaptive guilt and depression.

Mandarin tone sandhi is a tonal process changing Tone 3 (T3) in different tonal and syntactic contexts, resulting in allophonic variants of T3 in connected speech. Previous studies found that Mandarin-learning 3-year-olds were able to productively apply tone sandhi processes in novel compounds, correctly using the allophonic variants of T3 in appropriate tone sandhi contexts (Tang et al., 2018, 2019). However, it remains unclear how these variants are represented in children's mental lexicon. This study, therefore, examined Mandarin-learning children's perceptual representation of allophonic variants of T3. Ninety-four 3- to 5-year-olds and 29 adults were tested. Sensitivity to allophonic mispronunciations of T3 syllables in novel tone sandhi compounds was measured using a visual fixation procedure. The results showed that children, like adults, treated tone sandhi mispronunciations as target-like. Thus, in recognizing novel tone sandhi words, Mandarins-peaking children exhibit flexibility in accommodating the allophonic variants of T3, suggesting that they have developed an abstract T3 category in their mental lexicon. The findings reveal the effect of phonological processes in shaping children's phonological representations.

Oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) polymorphisms are associated with circulating oxytocin levels, altered brain activity, and parenting behaviors. This study aimed to replicate prior work on OXTR single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1042778 and rs53576 in relation to maternal sensitivity, explore associations with other aspects of parenting (i.e., negative parenting), evaluate observational and self-report measures of parenting in relation to OXTR SNPs, and examine whether childhood trauma exposure moderates the relation between OXTR SNPs and parenting. Mothers (N = 100) were observed during 2 teaching interaction tasks with their 7-month-old infant, completed questionnaire and interview measures related to parenting and trauma history, and provided saliva specimens to derive OXTR genotypes. Mothers with OXTR rs1042778 TT genotypes demonstrated lower behavioral sensitivity, lower engagement, higher intrusiveness, and more frequent frightened/frightening behavior than mothers with TG or GG genotypes. Genotype interacted with childhood trauma history such that mothers who had experienced childhood trauma were more likely to demonstrate frightened/frightening behavior if they had the TT genotype on rs1042778 relative to the TG or GG genotype; however, small cell sizes for this interaction suggest replication is warranted. Contrary to expectations, mothers with the TT genotype on rs1042778 self-reported that they had less impaired bonding than mothers with TG or GG genotypes. Results are discussed with respect to prior work with oxytocin in lower versus higher risk samples, and the potential role of mothers' self-awareness in explaining discrepancies between results from observational versus self-report measures of parenting.

Yet little is known about the mechanisms that may explain this association. Using longitudinal data across elementary school years (N = 1,364), this study examined the role of peer difficulty and poor academic performance in understanding longitudinal associations between executive function and internalizing problems. Executive function was measured in first grade with observed tasks and standardized tests. Peer difficulty and academic performance were reported by teachers and/or mothers at three waves. Internalizing problems were reported by mothers at four waves. Using structural equation modeling, results demonstrated that peer difficulty and poor academic performance independently mediated longitudinal relations between executive function and internalizing problems. Findings highlighted the importance of children's functioning in key identity domains in understanding the adverse impact of inferior executive function on internalizing problems in school-age children.

The Functions of Aggression in Gaining, Maintaining, and Losing Popularity During Adolescence: A Multiple-Cohort Design	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examined associations between perceived popularity trajectories and changes in proactive and reactive aggression in middle adolescence. The sample included 1,374 adolescents from 5 cohorts who were followed from Grade 7 to Grade 9 (49% males, M-age = 12.67 years, SD = .67). Popularity trajectories were identified based on initial status and changes in status over time, and linear mixed effects models tested group differences in changes of aggression. The results partially confirmed our expectation that changes in popularity were associated with specific developmental patterns of proactive and reactive aggression and also varied as a function of status already achieved. Specifically, adolescents in groups characterized by gains in status increased in proactive aggression, and those in groups characterized by losses in status decreased in proactive aggression. A more nuanced pattern of group differences emerged for reactive aggression. Changes in reactive aggression were only found for groups characterized by changes in unpopular status. Taken together, these findings suggest that proactive aggression has universal benefits for popularity in middle adolescence, whereas reactive aggression has differential costs. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

J	Wray-Lake, L; Shubert, J				Wray-Lake, Laura; Shubert, Jennifer			Understanding Stability and Change in Civic Engagement Across Adolescence: A Typology Approach	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Developmental theory posits that youth are civically engaged in different ways, patterns of civic development vary across individuals, and both stability and change in youth civic engagement can be influenced by experiences in context. Drawing on these notions, we used a longitudinal person-oriented approach to document stability and change in civic engagement typologies across adolescence. Sociodemographic differences were tested to understand adolescents' civic developmental starting points in eighth grade, and civic discussions with parents and friends were examined as time-varying predictors of stability and change in civic engagement across eighth to 12th grades. Using national U.S. Longitudinal Study of American Youth data (N = 3701), 5 annual assessments of civic engagement (civic values, political behaviors, and future civic expectations) served as latent transition analysis (LTA) indicators. A 4-class model was comprised of civic leaders, informed future voters, civic sympathizers, and unengaged youth. Civic engagement typologies in eighth grade varied systematically by gender, parent education, and race/ethnicity in ways that replicate and extend prior research. Civic discussions with parents and friends predicted stability in all 3 engaged typologies. Civic discussions with parents also predicted growth out of the unengaged group, whereas civic discussions with friends predicted remaining unengaged later in high school. Findings underscore patterns of civic inequality that are evident early in adolescence and illustrate the role of civic discussions in sustaining and increasing youth civic engagement.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				OCT	2019	55	10					2169	2180		10.1037/dev0000772	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000772								31282734					WOS:000488053500013

Using the Adolescent Intermediate Concepts Measure we analyze samples of adolescents (ages 12 to 20; N = 9,112) from 5 contexts: North Macedonia, Mexico, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Across samples, adolescents provide evidence of developmental growth in the ability to apply virtue concepts as assessed by responses to dilemma-based situations. Within these trends, participants found it easier to identify action choices that reflect the virtue concepts as compared to justifications for possible actions. Additionally, participants were better able to identify appropriate applications of the virtues as compared to inappropriate ones. Gender differences favoring females were noted across samples. Overall, similarities across settings were more striking than differences suggesting that there is value in viewing the virtues as a normative component of character development across the adolescent years.

Interactive Effects of Family Instability and Adolescent Stress Reactivity on Socioemotional Functioning	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study investigated whether adolescent vagal stress reactivity to parent-adolescent conflict moderates the effects of family instability on the development of adolescent behavioral problems. Participants were 192 adolescents (M age = 12.4) and their parents across 2 measurement occasions. Results indicated that the interaction between family instability and vagal stress reactivity significantly predicted change in externalizing problems. Greater family instability was associated with increases in externalizing problems only for adolescents showing greater vagal suppression (i.e., higher vagal reactivity) during a laboratory triadic family conflict discussion. Further tests suggested the interaction was consistent with diathesis stress, such that adolescents with higher vagal stress reactivity show higher increases in externalizing problems under high instability but not lower increases in externalizing symptoms with low family instability. Findings indicate disruptions in the proximal rearing contexts may differentially influence development for adolescents, but the impact may differ as a function of stress reactivity.

Since these effects are usually unrecognized or untreated in childhood, preventive and remediating interventions in adults are needed. Our focus on adulthood prompted three major questions. First, does our increased understanding of mechanisms accounting for the long-term effects of early life adversities help delineate underlying dimensions that underscore key similarities and differences among these adversities? Second, can adults accurately report on adversities they experienced in childhood? Third, can we identify malleable risk processes in adulthood that might be targets for preventive intervention? Supported by the National Institute on Aging, the U.K. Economic and Social and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Councils, a network of researchers in human and animal development addressed these questions through meetings and literature review. A small number of dimensions may adequately distinguish among a range of co-occurring childhood adversities. Widely used adult ascertainments of childhood adversity are poorly related to prospective ascertainment. Strategies for preventive interventions should be aimed both at adults who were actually exposed to adversity as well as those who recall adversity, but the targeted risk processes may be different. Now is an opportune time to support research on adult interventions based on unfolding research on critical periods of sensitivity to adversity in fetal and child development, on improved understanding of risk mechanisms that may persist across the life span, and on new insights on enhancing neuroplasticity in adults.

Moreover, some victims of school bullying may also experience revictimization at work as adults. Later revictimization at work may thus at least partly explain (i.e., mediate) the negative consequences of peer victimization in school. Revictimization at work may also exacerbate (i.e., moderate), the association between peer victimization in school and impaired mental and physical health in adulthood. These hypotheses were tested with 251 participants (61% females) followed from age 12 to 25. Participants reported about their depression symptoms and victimization experiences every year throughout adolescence, workplace victimization at age 22, and mental and physical health symptoms at age 25. Latent path analysis revealed that peer victimization during adolescence was significantly associated with lower overall mental and physical health at age 25 and a small, albeit significant part of this association was mediated by workplace victimization at age 22. These associations were mainly due to specific effects on elevated depression symptoms and paranoid ideation at age 25. In contrast, the moderation hypothesis was not supported. The findings emphasize the importance of reducing school bullying before victims become caught in a cycle of abuse and suffer lasting impairments.

Cognitive Sensitivity and Child Receptive Vocabulary: A Between- and Within-Family Study of Mothers and Sibling Pairs	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This study examined the association between observed cognitive sensitivity (CS) during family interactions and children's receptive vocabulary for older and younger siblings. Maternal and sibling CS was considered and associations were explored at the family-wide (between-family) and child-specific (within-family) levels of analysis. The interactions of mothers and 2 children per family were observed when younger siblings were 3.15 years (SD = 0.27) and older siblings were 5.57 years (SD = 0.77). Each dyad (mother-older sibling, mother younger-sibling, and sibling dyad, N = 385) completed a Lego building task, and there were two directional CS scores per interaction (e.g., mother toward older sibling, and older sibling toward mother). Results from multilevel models indicated that younger siblings' vocabulary was associated with the average level of CS for mothers and older siblings, independently. Conversely, older siblings' vocabulary was associated with the average level of maternal CS and child-specific maternal CS. Findings suggest that the relationship between CS and vocabulary operates across the family system and differs for older and younger siblings.					jenkins, jennifer/HJH-8268-2023														0012-1649	1939-0599				OCT	2019	55	10					2123	2134		10.1037/dev0000775	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000775								31282731					WOS:000488053500009

This study analyzes how late childhood intelligence, parental socioeconomic background, and gender relate to multiple dimensions of adult socioeconomic success (i.e., education, occupational status, and income). A particular focus is placed on education, which is considered as both an indicator of socioeconomic success and a mediator of the relationships with the other dimensions. Randomly sampled participants (N = 5,292) in a German prospective longitudinal study were assessed for the first time at age 12 years in 1991 and for the last time as adults in 2009-10. Comparison of the effects of childhood intelligence and parental socioeconomic background revealed childhood intelligence to be the more powerful predictor of the 3 dimensions of later adult socioeconomic success. Education was the strongest predictor of both later adult occupational status and later adult income, and mediated most of the effects of childhood intelligence and parental socioeconomic background on later adult occupational status and later adult income. A gender income gap was apparent, with men reporting higher income, even when childhood factors and education were controlled. Education barely mediated any gender differences, but family-related structural factors (i.e., working part time and having children) explained much of the gender gap in income.

J	Holodynski, M; Seeger, D				Holodynski, Manfred; Seeger, Dorothee			Expressions as Signs and Their Significance for Emotional Development	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												For research on emotional development, defining emotions as psychological systems of appraisals, expressions, body reactions, and subjective feelings in all phases of ontogenesis raises tricky methodological issues. How can we measure single emotions when appraisals and feelings cannot be assessed from outside, when expressions do not seem to be tied unequivocally to single emotions, and feelings are sometimes decoupled from perceivable expressions? Furthermore, how does a restricted set of neonate emotions differentiate into a culturally modified set of adult emotions? This article presents an innovative answer to these issues by applying Vygotsky's culture-historical approach on the psychological significance of social signs to the analysis of emotion, expression, and their development. The core assumption is that humans learn to use emotional expressions as communicative signs that appeal to another person to regulate their interaction through emotions and as psychological signs that appeal to the self to regulate the self's actions through emotions. This twofold function assigns a significant mediating role to expression for not only culture-historical and ontogenetic differentiation but also a growing awareness, self-regulation, and mental processing of emotions. The article describes three stages of emotional development supported by empirical evidence on how a biologically given set of neonate emotions are transformed into a culturally modified set of conscious, sign-mediated emotions that enables a decoupling of expression and feeling.

J	Hoemann, K; Xu, F; Barrett, LF				Hoemann, Katie; Xu, Fei; Barrett, Lisa Feldman			Emotion Words, Emotion Concepts, and Emotional Development in Children: A Constructionist Hypothesis	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												In this article, we integrate two constructionist approaches-the theory of constructed emotion and rational constructivism-to introduce several novel hypotheses for understanding emotional development. We first discuss the hypothesis that emotion categories are abstract and conceptual, whose instances share a goal-based function in a particular context but are highly variable in their affective, physical, and perceptual features. Next, we discuss the possibility that emotional development is the process of developing emotion concepts, and that emotion words may be a critical part of this process. We hypothesize that infants and children learn emotion categories the way they learn other abstract conceptual categories-by observing others use the same emotion word to label highly variable events. Finally, we hypothesize that emotional development can be understood as a concept construction problem: a child becomes capable of experiencing and perceiving emotion only when her brain develops the capacity to assemble ad hoc, situated emotion concepts for the purposes of guiding behavior and giving meaning to sensory inputs. Specifically, we offer a predictive processing account of emotional development.

A few cross-cultural studies have shown that the Western pattern of face-to-face communication is absent in traditional rural cultures, without identifying other processes that promote emotional Co-regulation. The present study compared three different samples: Western middle-class families in Italy, rural traditional Nso farmer families in Cameroon, and West African sub-Saharan immigrant families in Italy using biweekly observations of 20 mother-infant dyads from each cultural context from age 4 to 12 weeks. Longitudinal sequential analysis of maternal and infant behaviors showed that from as early as 4 weeks, in Italian dyads maternal affectionate talking is linked with infant active attention to mother in sequences of face-to-face contact; this link fosters the subsequent emergence of infant smiling/cooing, and then sequences of positive feedback between infant and maternal emotional expressions that, by the 3rd month, dynamically stabilize. In contrast, for Cameroonian/Nso dyads over the 2nd and 3rd month, maternal motor stimulation marked by rhythmic vocalizing is linked with infant active attention to surroundings. The relatively few smiling/cooing actions of Nso babies at their mothers were answered mainly with tactile stimulation that did not foster the maintenance of face-to-face visual contact. Finally, West African immigrant dyads showed a combination of both face-to-face and sensorimotor coregulated exchanges observed in their new and native cultures. These findings suggest that emotional Co-regulation in early infancy can occur via multiple, culture-specific pathways that may be substantially different from the western pattern of face-to-face communication.

Predictive processing provides a new approach to brain function that has been used to explain a wide range of processes, from perception to socioemotional processing. The explanatory power of this framework for adult brain function is widely recognized, but it has yet to be systematically applied to understanding the developing brain. Studying the findings of developmental research under this framework may allow a deeper understanding of the predictive mechanisms and their ontogenetic course, and adds to knowledge on brain functions and developmental processes. Therefore, the goal of this work was to explore the potential complementarity of predictive processing and development. Specifically, we focus on how the development of facial and emotion processing may be understood under a predictive processing framework. The processing of facial expressions was selected because of the developmental relevance of these stimuli, their impact on general emotional development, as well as the large body of literature on this topic (comprised of both well-established but also incongruent findings, which a novel approach may clarify). Considering the main findings of developmental research on the processing of emotion-related facial configurations under this framework, we argue that predictive processing is consistent with developmental evidence and provides a promising avenue for developmental research, as it reveals new questions in the fields of development and emotion processing.

The present article argues that both positive emotions and the emotion of interest play important roles in prosocial behavior and development. First, we explore the ways in which positive emotions characterize infants' everyday prosocial behavior and the relationships that support these behaviors. We then examine the emotion of interest and its role in infants' prosocial behavior. This article synthesizes recent research on positive emotions in early prosocial development and provides a first attempt to link the emotion of interest to prosocial behavior. We close by discussing future directions for research on prosocial behavior with these emotions.

Fear in Infancy: Lessons From Snakes, Spiders, Heights, and Strangers	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This review challenges the traditional interpretation of infants' and young children's responses to three types of potentially "fear-inducing" stimuli-snakes and spiders, heights, and strangers. The traditional account is that these stimuli are the objects of infants' earliest developing fears. We present evidence against the traditional account, and provide an alternative explanation of infants' behaviors toward each stimulus. Specifically, we propose that behaviors typically interpreted as "fearful" really reflect an array of stimulus-specific responses that are highly dependent on context, learning, and the perceptual features of the stimuli. We speculate about why researchers so commonly misinterpret these behaviors, and conclude with future directions for studying the development of fear in infants and young children.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				SEP	2019	55	9			SI		1889	1907		10.1037/dev0000675	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000675								31464493					WOS:000483067100007

Emerging evidence in adults has suggested that the hippocampus and its associated network may play an important role in empathic responding, possibly via processes such as memory of emotional events, but the contribution of this structure in early childhood is unknown. We examined concurrent associations between empathic responding and hippocampal volume in a sample of 78 children (ages 4-8 years). Larger bilateral hippocampal volume (adjusted for intracranial volume) predicted greater observed empathic responses toward an experimenter in distress, but only for boys. The association was not driven by a specific subregion of the hippocampus (head, body, tail), nor did it vary with age. Empathic responding was not significantly related to amygdala volume, suggesting specificity of relations with the hippocampus. Results support the proposal that hippocampal structure contributes to individual differences in children's empathic responding, consistent with research in adults. Findings shed light on an understudied structure in the complex neural systems supporting empathic responding and raise new questions regarding sex differences in the neurodevelopment of empathy in early childhood.

J	Moreira, JFG; McLaughlin, KA; Silvers, JA				Moreira, Joao F. Guassi; McLaughlin, Katie A.; Silvers, Jennifer A.			Spatial and Temporal Cortical Variability Track With Age and Affective Experience During Emotion Regulation in Youth	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Variability is a fundamental feature of human brain activity that is particularly pronounced during development. However, developmental neuroimaging research has only recently begun to move beyond characterizing brain function exclusively in terms of magnitude of neural activation to incorporate estimates of variability. No prior neuroimaging study has done so in the domain of emotion regulation. We investigated how age and affective experiences relate to spatial and temporal variability in neural activity during emotion regulation. In the current study, 70 typically developing youth aged 8 to 17 years completed a cognitive reappraisal task of emotion regulation while undergoing functional MRI. Estimates of spatial and temporal variability during regulation were calculated across a network of brain regions, defined a priori, and were then related to age and affective experiences. Results showed that increasing age was associated with reduced spatial and temporal variability in a set of frontoparietal regions (e.g., dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, superior parietal lobule) known to be involved in effortful emotion regulation. In addition, youth who reported less negative affect during regulation had less spatial variability in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, which has previously been linked to cognitive reappraisal. We interpret age-related reductions in spatial and temporal variability as implying neural specialization. These results suggest that the development of emotion regulation is undergirded by a process of neural specialization and open a host of possibilities for incorporating neural variability into the study of emotion regulation development.

J	Gross, JT; Cassidy, J				Gross, Jacquelyn T.; Cassidy, Jude			Expressive Suppression of Negative Emotions in Children and Adolescents: Theory, Data, and a Guide for Future Research	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												In recent years, an increased interest in the importance of children's ability to regulate emotions in socially adaptive ways has driven considerable research on the development of emotion regulation. A widely studied emotion regulation strategy known as expressive suppression (ES), in which a person attempts to conceal emotion-expressive behavior, has been the focus of several recent studies of child and adolescent emotion regulation. Like much of the literature on children's emotion regulation strategies in general, this literature lacks a theoretical framework for organizing the findings, understanding their implications, and guiding future research (Cole, Martin, & Dennis, 2004). In the present review, we integrate theory and data on ES in childhood and adolescence using the process model of emotion regulation (Gross, 2015), a framework that is widely used in research with adults, to organize and interpret the findings. Specifically, the process model is used to understand what factors contribute to children's use of ES in a given context and when and why ES might be associated with negative emotional, social, cognitive, and physiological costs. We conclude by outlining an agenda for future research, noting major gaps in current knowledge, offering novel ways of thinking about ES in childhood, and highlighting new directions for moving the field forward. Research illuminating the developmental course and correlates of expressive suppression in early life can contribute to a deeper understanding of this emotion regulation strategy and can inform intervention efforts to improve outcomes across the life span.

Using an event-contingent experience sampling design wherein 150 adults Age 18 to 89 years reported on 64,213 social interactions (M = 427.41, SD = 145.66) during 9 weeks of daily life, this study examines (a) age-related differences in individuals' usual ER strategy use (reappraisal, suppression) during everyday social interactions, (b) age-related differences in how much individuals' use of these two strategies varies across social situations-ER variability, and (c) age-related differences in the extent to which ER strategy use covaries with relational (close vs. nonclose others) and emotional (happy, sad) contextual features of those social situations-ER flexibility. In line with a small body of prior work, usual ER strategy use did not differ across adulthood and ER variability was lower at older ages. Results from multilevel models of intraindividual covariation suggested that individuals flexibly matched their ER strategy implementation to changes in emotional context-especially when interacting with close others. The results also provided evidence that the intraindividual covariation between relational context and use of suppression was weaker at older ages. Beyond these specific findings, this study demonstrated the utility of experience sampling designs, event-contingent reports, and the measurement/modeling of intraindividual variation and covariation for study of emotional development across the life span.

J	Martinez, AM				Martinez, Aleix M.			The Promises and Perils of Automated Facial Action Coding in Studying Children's Emotions	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Computer vision algorithms have made tremendous advances in recent years. We now have algorithms that can detect and recognize objects, faces, and even facial actions in still images and video sequences. This is wonderful news for researchers that need to code facial articulations in large data sets of images and videos, because this task is time consuming and can only be completed by expert coders, making it very expensive. The availability of computer algorithms that can automatically code facial actions in extremely large data sets also opens the door to studies in psychology and neuroscience that were not previously possible, for example, to study the development of the production of facial expressions from infancy to adulthood within and across cultures. Unfortunately, there is a lack of methodological understanding on how these algorithms should and should not be used, and on how to select the most appropriate algorithm for each study. This article aims to address this gap in the literature. Specifically, we present several methodologies for use in hypothesis-based and exploratory studies, explain how to select the computer algorithms that best fit to the requirements of our experimental design, and detail how to evaluate whether the automatic annotations provided by existing algorithms are trustworthy.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				SEP	2019	55	9			SI		1965	1981		10.1037/dev0000728	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000728								31464498					WOS:000483067100012

M.; Hollenstein, Tom			Adolescents' Emotion System Dynamics: Network-Based Analysis of Physiological and Emotional Experience	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												An individual's emotions system can be conceived of as a synchronized, coordinated, and/or emergent combination of physiology, experience, and behavioral components. Together, the interplay among these components produce emotional experiences through coordinated excitatory positive feedback (i.e., the mutual amplification of emotion concordance) and/or inhibitory negative feedback (i.e., the damping of emotion regulation) processes. Different system configurations produce differential psychophysiological reactivity profiles, and by implication, differential moment-to-moment emotional experience and long-term development. Applying dynamic systems models to second-by-second psychophysiological and experience time-series data collected from 130 adolescents (age 12.0 to 16.7 years) completing a social stress-inducing speech task, we describe the configuration of adolescents' emotion systems, and examine how differences in the dynamic outputs of those systems (psychophysiological reactivity profile) are related to individual differences in trait anxiety. We found substantial heterogeneity in the coordination patterns of these adolescents. Some individuals' emotion systems were characterized by negative feedback loops (emotion regulation processes), many by unidirectionally connected or independent components, and a few by positive feedback loops (emotion concordance). The reactivity dynamics of respiratory sinus arrhythmia were related to adolescents' level of trait anxiety. Results highlight how dynamic systems models may contribute to our understanding of interindividual and developmental differences.

The established field of the history of emotions is introduced as a means of complicating bioconstruction by highlighting the contingency of the world in which emotional development takes place. Once the developing brain-body is understood to be historically specific, new questions emerge, old debates (especially about universality) are settled, and the pathway toward interdisciplinary collaboration on the question of experience opens up.

J	Vaish, A				Vaish, Amrisha			Something Old, Something New: Leveraging What We Know to Optimize New Directions in Emotion Development Research	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The 3 papers by Hammond and Drummond (2019), LoBue and Adolph (2019), and Stern, Botdorf, Cassidy, and Riggins (2019) bring into focus some of the exciting and promising new directions emerging in the field of emotional development. This commentary urges researchers moving in these new directions to leverage what is already known about emotional development to inform future predictions and interpretations, as well as to remain mindful of the thorny but essential questions surrounding the conceptualization, measurement, and interpretation of emotions. These points are illustrated with a focus on 2 specific topics. The first concerns how we conceptualize positive and negative emotions and what we might predict about their respective psychological and behavioral effects. The second concerns what should (not) count as evidence of an emotion in infants and young children and highlights the importance of converging evidence across methods and measures as well as of validating measures. This extends to the study of emotional mechanisms such as empathy and sympathy. Considering these questions carefully at this juncture has the potential to make the future study of emotional development all the more fruitful and effective.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				SEP	2019	55	9			SI		1998	2001		10.1037/dev0000774	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000774								31464501					WOS:000483067100015

J	Dennis-Tiwary, TA				Dennis-Tiwary, Tracy A.			The Future of Emotion Regulation Research Is in How We Measure the Dynamics of Change	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Change is the sine qua non of emotion regulation (ER) and, thus, to understand ER we must analyze its temporal dynamics. Articles in the ER section of this special issue provide strong empirical evidence for the centrality of temporal dynamics in the development of ER on 3 levels: Rapid changes in spatial and temporal dynamics across multimodal systems underlying ER; more slowly emerging ER change over periods of time and development; and change in ER across contexts, including social interactions, culture, and coregulation in parent-child interactions. I describe how the articles by Guassi Moreira and colleagues (2019) and Lavelli and colleagues (2019) exemplify the methodological and conceptual focus on temporal dynamics. Taken together, the articles on ER demonstrate the importance of interweaving a microlevel focus on neural and biological development with a more macrolevel focus on the broader contexts of ER to advance the science of emotional development.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				SEP	2019	55	9			SI		2006	2008		10.1037/dev0000752	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000752								31464503					WOS:000483067100017
J	Silk, JS				Silk, Jennifer S.			Context and Dynamics: The New Frontier for Developmental Research on Emotion Regulation	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Despite much research and progress in understanding the development of emotion regulation over the past 3 decades, there is still much to be understood about how developing individuals modulate their affect as they go about their daily life. The papers in this special issue highlight context and dynamics as 2 important intersecting foci for future developmental research on emotion regulation. Ecological momentary assessment, passive sensing, and other ambulatory methods offer exciting new tools for capturing contextual features of the environment that may influence the selection of emotion regulation strategies and the effectiveness of specific strategies in different contexts. New interdisciplinary, methodological, and quantitative approaches also offer new tools for better characterizing the temporal dynamics of emotion regulation, including a focus on the coregulation of affect between parents and children. The next generation of emotion regulation researchers will require advanced interdisciplinary, quantitative, and technological skills to be able to leverage new tools that can better characterize the fine-grained dynamics of emotion regulation processes and the precise ways in which social contextual features modulate these processes.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				SEP	2019	55	9			SI		2009	2014		10.1037/dev0000768	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000768								31464504					WOS:000483067100018
J	D'Arms, J; Samuels, R				D'Arms, Justin; Samuels, Richard			Could Emotion Development Really Be the Acquisition of Emotion Concepts?	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Emotion development research centrally concerns capacities to produce emotions and to think about them. We distinguish these enterprises and consider a novel account of how they might be related. On one recent account, the capacity to have emotions of various kinds comes by way of the acquisition of emotion concepts. This account relies on a constructionist theory of emotions and an embodied theory of emotion concepts. We explicate these elements, then raise a challenge for the approach. It appears to be incompatible with various familiar ways in which cognitions about one's own emotions can come apart from episodes of emotion.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				SEP	2019	55	9			SI		2015	2019		10.1037/dev0000767	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000767								31464505					WOS:000483067100019
J	Reddy, V				Reddy, Vasudevi			Meeting Infant Affect	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Emotions remain something of a mystery for most of us even when we accept their centrality to development in general and to infancy in particular. I make 2 arguments in this paper. One: that the most crucial thing about emotions is that they allow mutuality of engagement with other emotional beings-not only evoking responses, but also provoking further emotions in others. Mutual engagements-sometimes called moments of meeting or encounters with other minds-can be transformational. They allow us to be "seen," to be "known" by others, and in achieving that, they allow us to be persons. Some key phenomena of emotional encounters in infancy are discussed to illustrate this point. Evidence of such meetings is abundant in our lives and needs a committed focus for study within developmental psychology. Two: that we need to open out the idea of emotions (as well as probe at a microlevel) and the terms affect or affectivity might help encompass a greater breadth. Daniel Stern's " vitality affects" and Ben Anderson's " affective atmospheres" both cross disciplinary boundaries in contemplating emotional phenomena. It seems crucial for developmental psychology to incorporate such different aspects-neurological, kinematic, situational and sociopolitical-into discussions of emotional development.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				SEP	2019	55	9			SI		2020	2024		10.1037/dev0000773	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000773								31464506					WOS:000483067100020

Progress in Understanding the Emergence of Human Emotion INTRODUCTION	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												In the past several decades, research on emotional development has flourished. Scientists have made progress in understanding infants', children's, and adults' abilities to recognize, communicate, and regulate their emotions. However, many questions remain unanswered or only partly answered. We are poised to move from descriptions of aspects of emotional functioning to conceptualizing and studying the developmental mechanisms that underlie those aspects. The gaps in our knowledge provide numerous opportunities for further investigation. With this special issue of Developmental Psychology, we aim to stimulate such progress, especially among colleagues at the beginning of their careers. The articles in this issue are intended to challenge our concepts and take research on emotional development in new directions. Toward this end, this special issue includes empirical studies, theoretical articles, novel conceptualizations, methodological innovations, and invited commentaries from scholars across a range of disciplines. In this introductory essay, we briefly review the history of research on emotional development and provide an overview of the contributions of this special issue with thoughts about the current state of the developmental science and areas in which further advancement on emotional development must be made. These include understanding the nature of emotion itself, identifying the mechanisms that produce developmental changes, examining emotion regulation within differing social contexts, and creating measures of culture that acknowledge globalization, historical change, and within-culture differences.

These abilities are appreciable both by researchers with strictly standardized criteria and caregivers with more relaxed notions of what each of these skills entails. Here, we compare the onsets of these skills and links among them across two data collection methods: observation and parental report. We examine pointing, walking, and talking in a sample of 44 infants studied longitudinally from 6 to 18 months. In this sample, links between pointing and vocabulary were tighter than those between walking and vocabulary, supporting a unified socio-communicative growth account. Indeed, across several cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, pointers had larger vocabularies than their nonpointing peers. In contrast to previous work, this did not hold for walkers' versus crawlers' vocabularies in our sample. Comparing across data sources, we find that reported and observed estimates of the growing vocabulary and of age of walk onset were closely correlated, while agreement between parents and researchers on pointing onset and talking onset was weaker. Taken together, these results support a developmental account in which gesture and language are intertwined aspects of early communication and symbolic thinking, whereas the shift from crawling to walking appears indistinct from age in its relation with language. We conclude that pointing, walking, and talking are on similar timelines yet distinct from one another, and discuss methodological and theoretical implications in the context of early development.

Herein, we use a person-centered approach to identify clusters of infants who exhibit similar behavioral profiles during face-to-face communication with their mothers. Four infant communication channels were examined-gaze, facial affect, vocal affect, and head orientation-coded from videotape at a 1-s temporal resolution. We used k-means clustering to classify community infants (N = 132) into 10 groups, based on variation in the intercept and the autocorrelation function at the first time lag, representing respectively the overall level of behavior and the predictability of the infant's moment-by-moment behavioral stream, in each of the 4 communication channels. In this exploratory study, 10 clusters were identified, some with unusual levels or predictability of behavior in varying channels, and clusters associated differentially with risk outcomes (infant 4-month temperament and 12-month attachment). Distinct forms of affective dysregulation were identified: sustained negative vocal affect associated with degree of disorganization; random vocal affect associated with attachment resistance; random facial affect and vocal affect, irrespective of positive/negative valence, associated with infant difficult temperament. Clustering multiple channels of infant communication generated unique behavioral profiles and predicted 4- and 12-month outcomes, suggesting that these clusters may indeed represent natural types of infant communicative behavior, not easily observed with the naked eye, that may be useful behavioral markers of clinical risk.

"Tap Space Number Three": Promoting Math Talk During Parent-Child Tablet Play	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The prevalence of tablet computer use among young children has risen dramatically, as have educational apps claiming to promote school readiness skills such as mathematical knowledge. Parents can contribute to their preschoolers' math readiness through the math talk they provide during everyday interactions in traditional nonelectronic activities. However, it is unclear how parents talk about math during tablet play with their children, and how additional suggestions to focus on math might increase the frequency of this talk during tablet play. Fifty-one parents and their 4- and 5-year-olds (M-age = 5 years, 0 months) played with a tablet-based numerical board game for 10 min. Half of the parents were randomly assigned to receive brief additional guidance to focus on teaching their children about numbers while playing the game. All parents produced a large amount of math-related talk relative to total talk while playing the numerical tablet game, yet parents who received the additional instructions produced more math-related talk compared to parents who did not receive the additional instructions. Children also produced more math-related talk in response to parent prompting when their parents received the additional guidance. Further, parents talked significantly less about counting when their children were more skilled at counting, but only when given guidance to talk about numeracy. The findings show promising evidence that math-related tablet computer games serve as an ideal context for parent-child math talk, and with brief guidance, frequency of this talk can be increased.

With age, children are increasingly expected to decide autonomously and with little external aid which goals to attain. However, little is known about how children engage cognitive control in such a self-directed fashion. The present study examined self-directed control development by adapting the voluntary task switching paradigm-the gold standard measure of this control form in adults-for use with 5-6-year-old and 9-10-year-old children. Overall, p(switch) suggested that even younger children can engage self-directed control successfully. However, other measures showed they struggled with task selection. Specifically, compared with older children and adults, they relied more on systematic strategies which reduced the cost of task selection, even when the strategy involved switching more often. Like externally driven control, self-directed control relies critically on task selection processes. These two forms of control likely form a continuum rather than two discrete categories.

We examined whether ground rules instruction-to say "I don't know," to tell the truth, and to correct the interviewer when necessary-assisted children in applying those rules during an interview about a past event and whether doing so was associated with more accurate accounts. We compared children with intellectual disabilities (mild or moderate severity, n = 44, 7-12 years) with 3 groups of typically developing children (2 matched for mental age, and 1 for chronological age, n = 55, 4-12 years) on their understanding of 3 ground rules, their use of these rules in an interview, and their accuracy in recalling a personally experienced event. Many children were able to demonstrate proficiency with the rules following simple instruction but others required additional teaching. Children applied the rules sparingly in the interview. Their scores on the practice trials of each rule were unrelated to each other, and to the use of the rules in context. Their developmental level was significantly related to both of these skills. Regression models showed that developmental level was the best predictor of children's accuracy when they recounted their experience during the interview but that use of responses consistent with the rules, in conjunction with developmental level, predicted accurate resistance to suggestive questions. Future research should identify how best to prepare children of different ages and cognitive abilities to answer adults' questions appropriately.

What drives children's looking toward the mouth versus eyes of a talking face? This study reports data from 292 children who viewed faces speaking English, French, and Russian. We investigated the impact of children's age (5 months to 5 years) and language background (monolingual English, monolingual French, bilingual English-French), and the speaker's language (dominant, nondominant, or nonnative) relative to children's native language(s). Data from 129 bilingual adults were also collected for comparison. Five-month-olds showed balanced attention to the eyes and mouth, but children up to 5 years tended to be most interested in the mouth. In contrast, adults were most interested in the eyes. We found little evidence for different patterns of attention for monolinguals versus bilinguals, or to a native versus a nonnative speaker. Using percentile scores, monolinguals with larger productive vocabularies looked more at the mouth, while bilinguals with larger comprehension vocabularies looked marginally less at the mouth, although both effects were small and not as robust with raw vocabulary scores. Children showed large but stable individual variability in their face scanning patterns across different speakers. Our results show that the way that children allocate their attention to talking faces continues to change from infancy through the preschool years and beyond. Future studies will need to go beyond looking at bilingualism, speaker language, and vocabulary size to understand what drives children's in-the-moment attention to talking faces.

However, empirical evidence for a relation between prediction error and children's language learning is currently lacking. Here we investigated whether and how prediction errors influence children's learning of novel words. We hypothesized that word learning would vary as a function of 2 factors: the extent to which children generate predictions, and the extent to which children redirect attention in response to errors. Children were tested in a novel word learning task, which used eye tracking to measure (a) real-time semantic predictions to familiar referents, (b) attention redirection following prediction errors, and (c) learning of novel referents. Results indicated that predictions and prediction errors interdependently supported novel word learning, via children's efficient redirection of attention. This study provides a developmental evaluation of prediction-based theories and suggests that erroneous predictions play a mechanistic role in children's language learning.

J	Lessard, LM; Juvonen, J				Lessard, Leah M.; Juvonen, Jaana			Cross-Class Friendship and Academic Achievement in Middle School	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												Academic achievement disparities based on parental education are robust during the middle school years. The current study examined whether cross-class friendship (i.e., reciprocal relationships between peers with different levels of parental education) decrease class-based achievement differences during a developmental phase when friends are particularly important. Relying on a sample of 4,288 sixth grade students (M = 12.03 years) from 26 ethnically diverse middle schools, multilevel analyses were conducted predicting seventh-grade grade point average, standardized achievement test scores, and teacher-rated academic engagement. The associations between parental education and academic achievement were reduced when students had at least 1 cross-class friendship at sixth grade. The findings are discussed in terms of how socioeconomic diversity of school-based friendships can level the academic playing field.																			0012-1649	1939-0599				AUG	2019	55	8					1666	1679		10.1037/dev0000755	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/dev0000755								31094557					WOS:000476498000009

However, these expectations about future outcomes are not always communicated explicitly. Thus, the ability to infer others' expectations in context and understand how these expectations influence others' emotions is an important aspect of our social intelligence. Prior work suggests that an abstract understanding of how expectations modulate emotional responses may not emerge until 7 to 8 years of age. Using a novel paradigm that capitalizes on intuitive physics to generate contextually plausible expectations, we present evidence for expectation-based emotion inference in preschool-aged children. Given two bowlers who experienced identical final outcomes (hitting 3 of 6 pins), we varied the trajectory of their balls such that one would initially expect to hit all pins (high-expectation), while the other would expect to hit none (low-expectation). In Experiment 1, both 4- and 5-year-olds appropriately adjusted characters' happiness ratings upward (low-expectation) or downward (high-expectation) relative to their initial emotions; however, only 5-year-olds made adjustments robust enough to manifest as higher final ratings for the low-expectation than the high-expectation character. In Experiments 2-3, we replicate these results and show that 5-year-olds reliably differentiate the characters' emotions even when their expectations must be inferred from context. An internal meta-analysis revealed a robust and consistent effect across the three experiments. Together, these findings provide the earliest evidence for expectation-based emotion reasoning and suggest that the ability to spontaneously generate and consider others' expectations continues to develop during preschool years.

Children Show Adult-Like Facial Appearance Biases When Trusting Others	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												A large research literature details the powerful behavioral consequences that a trustworthy appearance can have on adult behavior. Surprisingly, few studies have investigated how these biases operate among children, despite the theoretical importance of understanding when these biases emerge in development. Here, we used an economic trust game to systematically investigate trust behavior in young children (5-8 years), older children (9-12 years), and adults. Participants played the game with child and adult "partners" that varied in emotional expression (mild displays of happiness and anger, and a neutral baseline), which is known to modulate perceived trustworthiness. Strikingly, both groups of children showed adult-like facial appearance biases when trusting others, with no "own-age bias." There were no developmental differences in the magnitude of this effect, which supports adult-like overgeneralization of these transient emotion cues into enduring trait impressions that guide interpersonal behavior from as early as 5 years of age. Irrespective of whether or not they were explicitly directed to do so, all participants modulated their behavior in line with the emotion cues: more generous and trusting with happy partners, followed by neutral, and then angry. These findings speak to the impressive sophistication of children's early social cognition and provide key insights into the causal mechanisms driving trait impressions, suggesting they are not necessarily contingent upon protracted social experience.

J	Goulding, BW; Atance, CM; Friedman, O				Goulding, Brandon W.; Atance, Cristina M.; Friedman, Ori			An Advantage for Ownership Over Preferences in Children's Future Thinking	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The ability to anticipate the future improves significantly across the preschool years. Whereas 5-year-olds understand that they will prefer adult items in the future, 3-year-olds indicate they will continue to prefer child items. We explore these age-related changes in future-oriented cognition by comparing children's inferences about their future preferences with judgments about their future ownership. In Experiment 1, we show that 3- to 5-year-olds (N = 120) exhibit an ownership advantage in their future thinking-they are better able to indicate which objects they will own as adults than to indicate which they will prefer. We propose 2 explanations for this finding. First, children may rely more heavily on their semantic knowledge when inferring ownership than when inferring preferences, allowing them to sidestep the difficult task of mentally projecting themselves into the future. Second, ownership inferences may involve less conflict than preference inferences (e.g., conflict between a child's present and future desires). In Experiment 2, we test these accounts by comparing 3-year-olds' (N = 120) judgments about their own future ownership and preferences with judgments about what a present adult owns and prefers. We replicate the ownership advantage from Experiment 1 and further find that the ownership advantage holds when reasoning about a present adult. Our findings therefore support the conflict account, suggesting children struggle to infer what they will prefer as adults because their present and future preferences are in conflict.

Wall; Steinberg, Laurence; Cauffman, Elizabeth			Estimating and Predicting the Course of Callous-Unemotional Traits in First-Time Adolescent Offenders	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The stability of callous-unemotional (CU) traits and both individual and contextual factors that influence this stability have been studied in community adolescent samples but not to great extent in adolescents who have been arrested. We estimated the developmental changes in CU traits measured over the course of 36 months (6-month intervals) following the first arrest of male adolescents (N = 1,216). Using latent growth curve modeling and the multiple cohort multiple group method to account for the accelerated cohort study design, we were able to estimate the degree of change in these traits from ages 13 to 20 years. Overall in the sample, CU traits showed a moderate level of stability, similar to what has been reported in community samples, as well as an overall decline at older ages. Whether the adolescent was formally processed after first arrest (positively) and intelligence (negatively) was related to high levels of CU traits at arrest but unrelated to changes over time. Impulse control and maternal warmth showed consistent negative associations whereas self-reported offending, neighborhood disorganization, and association with delinquent peers showed consistent positive associations with CU traits over time. These findings support the importance of these variables for understanding the level and course of CU traits in justice-involved adolescents and provide potential targets for interventions implemented to reduce these traits in justice-involved adolescents.

Benjamin			Dynamic Patterns of Marital Conflict: Relations to Trajectories of Adolescent Adjustment	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												The deleterious effects of marital conflict on youth outcomes are well-documented in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. To date, longitudinal studies have focused on repeated measures of youths' outcomes and the temporal dynamics of marital conflict have largely been ignored. Marital conflict changes over time as contextual and relationship characteristics change, and these patterns of change may provide unique predictive power in accounting for differences in youth outcomes. This study provides a novel exploration of an old idea by focusing on dynamic patterns of marital conflict in predicting trajectories of adolescents' adjustment. All variables were measured at ages 16, 17, and 18 with 252 adolescents (53% female) enrolled in the longitudinal Family Stress and Youth Development Study. Latent growth curve models with latent variable interactions were used to determine whether marital conflict at age 16 (intercept), change over time in marital conflict (slope), and the intercept-slope interaction predicted change over time in adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptoms and levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms at age 18. Youth exposed to high and increasing levels of marital conflict reported high and stable levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms across adolescence. Adolescents exposed to low and decreasing levels of marital conflict had consistently fewer symptoms. Furthermore, exposure to initially low but increasing levels of marital conflict was associated with increases in problems across adolescence, which contrasted with findings for youth with initially high marital conflict exposure that decreased over time. Findings are discussed in relation to both conceptual and methodological advances.

Linking Identity and Depressive Symptoms Across Adolescence: A Multisample Longitudinal Study Testing Within-Person Effects	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												This multisample longitudinal study examined the directionality of effects between identity exploration and commitment processes and depressive symptoms across adolescence. We compared two theoretical perspectives. According to the vulnerability model, identity uncertainty predicts depressive symptoms, whereas the scar model holds that depressive symptoms play into identity uncertainty. In investigating both models, we examined reciprocal within-person associations in Study 1 (N = 497, M-age Time 1 [T1] = 14.03 years, comprising five annual waves) and Study 2 (N = 1,022, M-age T1 = 15.80 years, comprising four annual waves). To this end, we applied the random-intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM) in both studies. Results supported the vulnerability model across Studies 1 and 2. Specifically, within-person increasing reconsideration of commitment (Study 1) and ruminative exploration (Study 2) predicted a within-person increase in depressive symptoms 1 year later, but not vice versa. Commitment processes did not predict depressive symptoms at the within-person level. Our findings indicate that maladaptive exploration processes of identity formation play a particularly important role in the development of depressive symptoms at the within-person level.

Depressive symptoms and the quality of the parent-adolescent relationships were measured through adolescents' self-reports from ages 13 to 17. Group-based trajectory modeling revealed that most adolescents experienced high-quality relationships with both of their parents, characterized by high levels of warmth and low levels of conflict, and marked by gradual changes over adolescence. However, 3% of adolescents showed a trajectory of high and increasing conflict with their mothers and 16% of adolescents showed a trajectory of low warmth with their fathers, which decreased until mid-adolescence before increasing thereafter. Moreover, in line with an evocative gene-environment correlation process, a higher genetic vulnerability to depressive symptoms increased the likelihood of following a more problematic relationship trajectory with parents. This rGE was mediated by adolescents' actual depressive behavior symptoms. Results also suggest that adolescents' depression symptoms may affect girls' and boys' relationship with their parents in a similar way, with specific sex-patterns revolving more around the sex of the parent.

DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY												It is widely believed that there is a crisis of confidence in law enforcement in the United States. What remains to be seen, however, is whether adolescents actually differentiate between legal authorities and other types of authorities. Leveraging cross-sectional, nationally representative data of 12th graders from every year from 2006 to 2017 from Monitoring the Future (N = 10,941), the results indicate that adolescents distinguish between legal authorities (e.g., law enforcement, justice system) and social authorities (e.g., schools, religious institutions). Youth report more confidence in social authorities than in legal authorities. Furthermore, whereas confidence in social authorities remained largely stable between the cohorts over the last decade, confidence in legal authorities, and in law enforcement in particular, has declined markedly. Although there may be an era of mistrust in legal authorities, it cannot be attributed to a ubiquitous anti-authority attitude among modern adolescents in the United States.
