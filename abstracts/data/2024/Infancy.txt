One approach attributes this result to the potential of variability to make the stability of individual cues visible. Another approach suggests that, instead of highlighting individual cues, variability uncovers stable relations between cues that signal a sound contrast. Here, we investigate the relation between Voice Onset Time and the onset of F1 formant frequency, two cues that subserve the voicing contrast in German. First, we verified that German-speaking adults' use of VOT to categorize voiced and voiceless stops is dependent on the value of the F1 onset frequency, in the specific form of a so-called trading relation. Next, we tested whether 6-month-old German learning infants exhibit differential sensitivity to stimulus continua in which the cues varied to an equal extent, but either adhered to the trading relation established in the adult experiment or adhered to a reversed relation. Our results present evidence that infants prefer listening to speech in which phonetic cues conform to certain cue trading relations over cue relations that are reversed.

Parent-report instruments were used to measure all variables in younger siblings of children with autism (siblings, n = 74) and children born before 30 gestational weeks (preterms, n = 38). Higher scores of object play fully mediated the association between more SS and better language/less social-communicative difficulties. Hypo- and hyperresponsiveness at 10M did not seem to predict language heterogeneity at 24M, but more hypo- and less hyperresponsiveness at 10M were associated with more social-communicative difficulties at 24M. The explained variance in social-communicative difficulties and language was limited (15.25%-16.39%). Similar associations were found for siblings and preterms. This highlights that high frequency of SP behaviors does not necessarily negatively affect communication in young EL-children as is commonly assumed. Early object play skills play a role in the association between early SS and later language/social communicative difficulties. This implies that some criteria of the two core domains of characteristics of autism are interrelated in EL-children, and this may have implications for early intervention programs.					; Steyaert, Jean/B-5326-2015	van Esch, Lotte/0000-0003-2301-2138; Steyaert, Jean/0000-0003-2512-4694; Noens, Ilse/0000-0003-3353-4423; Moerman, Floor/0000-0003-3025-0484													1525-0008	1532-7078				2024 OCT 9	2024										10.1111/infa.12625	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12625		OCT 2024						39382140					WOS:001328619100001

However, communication is bidirectional, yet little is known about the infant's role in these interactions. This study (n = 35 4-month-old infants) explores how infant-directed speech, the number of adult words and turn-taking (both measured by the LENA system) are correlated with infants' temperament. Our findings reveal that, while mothers use the typical characteristics of infant-directed speech, they are not correlated with the infant's temperament. However, we observe more adult-infant turn-taking in both introverted infants (with lower Surgency scores) and infants with lower attention regulation (with lower Regulatory/Orienting scores). The number of adult words was not correlated with infants' temperament. We suggest that infants with an introverted temperament prefer quieter exchanges that may lead to more turns and that infants with lower attention regulation might create more opportunities for interactions due to their lower level of self-regulation. These findings suggest that infants' temperament is associated with how adults talk with infants (communicative turns) rather than how adults talk to infants (infant-directed speech, number of adult words). Our results underscore the infant's role in parent-infant communication.

Existing knowledge on infant object interaction has relied on Euro-American samples and observations confined to laboratory playrooms or families' homes, where object play is typically observed indoors and in rooms brimming with toys. Here we examined infants' everyday object play in Tajikistan, where spaces are uniquely laid out and homes are not child-centered and toy-abundant. The restrictive gahvora cradling practice in Tajikistan may indirectly shape how infants access and engage with objects. We documented how much time infants spent in object play, the types and diversity of objects they contacted, and the locations of play-indoors or outside. We observed 59 infants (12-24 months) during a 45-min naturalistic observation when infants were out of the gahvora. Infants engaged with objects 50% of the time. Despite a lack of object diversity, object interactions were frequent and dispersed throughout observations. Walkers tended to divide their object interactions between time spent indoors and outside, but pre-walkers mostly interacted with objects indoors. Caregivers inadvertently shape infants' opportunities for exploration and play through culturally guided childrearing practices. And infants make due: they take it upon themselves to move, explore, and engage-gleaning culturally relevant routines.

Families (N = 399) in an urban area in the United States were participants in a longitudinal study beginning in infancy. Mothers completed measures of stressful life events (Revised Life Events Questionnaire at all visits), maternal anxiety and depressive symptoms (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory, respectively, at infancy between 5 and 12 months, at 2 years, and at 3 years), maternal neuroticism (NEO Five-Factor Inventory at infancy), and child anxiety symptoms (Child Behavior Checklist 1.5-5 at 5 years). Linear mixed models (LMMs) were used in analyses. Maternal depressive symptoms from infancy through 3 years were associated with child anxiety symptoms; other main effects modeled (stressful life events, maternal anxiety symptoms, maternal neuroticism) were not associated with child anxiety symptoms. There was a significant interaction effect between stressful life events and maternal depression. Stressful events from infancy through 5 years of age increased risk for child anxiety symptoms at 5 years if the child's mother had a mild mood disturbance or depression, but not for children with non-depressed mothers.

Recent studies suggest that dyadic combinations of infants' behaviors and caregivers' responses are more robust predictors of children's vocabularies than these behaviors separately. Previous studies have not yet systematically compared different types of dyadic combinations. This study aimed to compare the predictive value of (a) frequencies of infants' behaviors (vocalisations, points, and shows + gives) regardless of caregivers' responses, (b) frequencies of infants' behaviors that elicited verbal responses, (c) frequencies of infants' behaviors that elicited multimodal responses, and (d) frequencies of infants' behaviors that did not elicit any responses from caregivers. We examined 114 caregiver-infant dyads at 9-11 months and children's concurrent and longitudinal vocabulary outcomes at 2-4 years. We found that infants' points elicited a large proportion of verbal responses from caregivers which were related to children's later receptive vocabularies. We also found that only shows + gives that elicited caregivers' responses related to infants' concurrent gesture repertoires. In contrast, infants' behaviors that did not elicit responses negatively related to child vocabulary. The results highlight the importance of examining dyadic combinations of infants' behaviors and caregivers' responses during interactions when examining relations to children's vocabulary development.						van der Klis, Anika/0000-0001-5807-0667													1525-0008	1532-7078				2024 SEP 25	2024										10.1111/infa.12626	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12626		SEP 2024						39322979					WOS:001321015000001

Distribution of words across the first years of life: A longitudinal analysis of everyday language input to three English-learning infants	INFANCY												Many in-lab studies have demonstrated that the distribution of word learning moments affects the strength and quality of word representations. How are words distributed in speech to children in their daily lives, and how is distribution related to other input characteristics? The present study analyzes transcripts of language input to English-learning infants from three longitudinal, naturalistic corpora captured between 6 and 39 months of age. To describe how word frequency varies across time, we calculated dispersion scores for all word types for each child. Dispersion quantifies the deviation of observed frequencies in each recording session from expected (uniform across sessions) word frequency, providing a measure of how evenly word utterances were spread across sessions. Dispersion is strongly correlated with frequency and moderately correlated with concreteness across all corpora, such that high frequency and low concreteness words are more evenly dispersed. Correlations with measures of age of acquisition (AoA) varied across corpora, and dispersion did not reliably predict AoA above and beyond frequency and concreteness. The contradiction between the current results and results from in-lab experiments is discussed. This study provides a foundation to explore how word learning unfolds across time and contexts in the real world.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				2024 SEP 24	2024										10.1111/infa.12622	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12622		SEP 2024						39317965					WOS:001321057200001

Body structure processing and attentional patterns in infancy and adulthood	INFANCY												Infants are sensitive to distortions to the global configurations of bodies by 3.5 months of age, suggesting an early onset of body knowledge. It is unclear, however, whether such sensitivity indicates knowledge of the location of specific body parts or solely reflects sensitivity to the overall gestalt of bodies. This study addressed this issue by examining whether, like adults, infants attend to specific locations where body parts have been reorganized. Results show that adults and 5-month-olds, but not 3.5-month-olds, allocated more attention to the body joint areas (e.g., where the arm connects to the shoulder) that were reorganized versus ones that were typical. To examine whether this kind of processing is driven by low-level features, 5-month-olds were tested on images in which the head was removed. Infants no longer exhibited differential scanning of typical versus reorganized bodies. Results suggest that 5-month-olds are sensitive to the location of body parts, thereby demonstrating adult-like response patterns consistent with early expertise in body processing. The contrasting failure of 3.5-month-olds to exhibit sensitivity to the reorganization suggests a developmental change between these ages.

J	Hilton, M; Twomey, KE; Westermann, G				Hilton, Matt; Twomey, Katherine E.; Westermann, Gert			Caregivers as experimenters: Reducing unfamiliarity helps shy children learn words	INFANCY												Previous work has found that shy children show chance-level disambiguation and retention of novel word meanings in a typical lab-based word learning task. This effect could be explained in terms of shy children's aversion to unfamiliarity disrupting the requisite attentional processes, because the task is marked by a high degree of unfamiliarity. To test this argument, we examined whether increasing the familiarity of the task facilitates shy children's ability to form and retain word meanings. Two-year-old children (N = 23) took part in a word learning task in which their caregiver acted as the experimenter. On referent selection trials, children were presented with sets of three objects, one novel and two familiar, and were asked for either a familiar object using its known label, or a novel object using a novel word. Children were then tested on their retention of the previously formed novel word-object mappings. In this context of increased familiarity, shyness was unrelated to performance on referent selection trials. However, shyness was positively related to children's retention of the word-object mappings, meaning that shyer children outperformed less-shy children on this measure of word learning. These findings show that context-based familiarity interacts with intrinsic individual differences to affect word learning performance.

How labels shape visuocortical processing in infants	INFANCY												The current study examined the extent to which labels shape visuocortical processing during the first year of life during a brief (similar to 6-min) associative learning task. Images of computer-generated artificial objects were paired with either individual-level (e.g., Jimmy, Boris) or category-level labels (e.g., Hitchel) while event-related potentials were recorded in response to the onset of the visual stimulus in 6- (n = 41), 9- (n = 27), and 12-month-old (n = 28) infants. Analyses examined experience-dependent visuocortical changes within and across trials, label conditions, and ages. Overall, results demonstrate that infants deploy greater visuocortical resources during the first half of associative learning trials and to stimuli paired with category-level relative to individual-level labels. Waveform morphologies also differed between stimuli paired with individual- and category-level labels and across the age groups, with more complex deflections and amplitude differences between label type at 9- and 12-month-olds, but not 6-month-old infants. The present results highlight the importance of associative learning during infancy and suggest that category- versus individual-level labels differentially direct infant attention and visuocortical processing.

J	Paillereau, N; Chládková, K				Paillereau, Nikola; Chladkova, Katerina			Infants' reliance on rhythm to distinguish languages: A critical review	INFANCY												This article reviews empirical methods and findings on early language discrimination, questioning rhythm-class based hypotheses on language discrimination in infancy, as well as the assumption that early language discrimination is driven primarily (or solely) by temporal prosodic cues. The present work argues that within-rhythm class discrimination which - according to the rhythmic hypothesis - is not applicable very early in life, has not been sufficiently tested with infants under 4 months of age, that familiarity with a language is not a prerequisite for its discrimination from another rhythmically similar language, and that the temporal rhythm properties may not universally be the primary cues to language discrimination. Although rhythm taxonomy is now by many understood as outdated, some developmental literature still draws on the assumption that rhythm classification determines infants' language discrimination; other studies consider rhythm along a continuous scale and only a few account for cues to language discrimination other than temporal ones. It is proposed that studies on early language discrimination systematically test the contribution of other than temporal rhythm cues, similarly to recent work on multidimensional psychoacoustic salience in the acquisition of segmental categories.

In infancy, plasticity expands and contracts depending on domains of functioning, developmental history, and timing. In terms of language processing, infants attend to and discriminate both native and non-native phonetic contrasts, but selectively attune to their native phonemes by the end of the first postnatal year. However, relevant studies have excluded factors regarded as promoters of attention such as infant-directed (ID) speech, synchronous multimodal presentations, and female speakers. Here we investigated whether English-learning 11-month-olds would discriminate a non-native phonetic contrast while manipulating these factors. Results showed significant discrimination of the non-native contrast, regardless of speech register, provided that they were presented by a dynamic female speaker. Interestingly, when a static object or a dynamic male ID speaker replaced the female, no significant discrimination was found. These results show infants to be capable of discriminating non-native phonetic contrasts in an enhanced context at an age when they have been characterized as not being able to do so. Synchronized, multimodal information from female speakers allowed infants to perceive difficult non-native phonemes, highlighting the importance of an ecologically valid context for studying speech perception and language learning in early development.

Infants' individuation of human faces across race and identity	INFANCY												Young infants' face perception capabilities quickly tune to the features of their primary caregiver. The current study examines whether infants distinguish faces in a more conceptual manner using a manual-search, violation of expectation task that has previously been used to test kind-based individuation. We tested how well infants between 11 and 27 months of age individuated faces that varied by superordinate category (human vs. non-human in Experiment 1) subordinate category (individual identity in Experiment 2) or by race (White vs. Black, Experiments 1 & 2). We assessed individuation by quantifying the difference in infants' duration of reaching within an empty box between trials when the box was unexpectedly empty and expectedly empty. We found evidence of individuation across all ages and conditions, but with within-infant variation. On average, infants individuated face from non-face stimuli (Experiment 1), individual face identities (Experiment 2), and White versus Black faces (Experiments 1 & 2). These findings suggest that 1- to 2-year-old infants use distinct human face features to represent individuals across time and space. We discuss this evidence for race-based individuation and related complexities of face identity in terms of implications for conceptual development for faces in the first years of life.						, Charisse B.

During the initial COVID-19 pandemic lockdown many of these families faced an abrupt halt to ECE. Here, we examined how toddlers from economically disadvantaged backgrounds enrolled in high-quality ECE programs in the United States during the 2020 pandemic (n = 48) fared on cognitive and socioemotional outcomes compared to a 2019 pre-pandemic cohort (n = 94) and a pandemic 2021 cohort (n = 132). Toddlers in the 2020 cohort scored significantly lower on executive function compared to toddlers in 2019 and 2021 cohorts. Toddlers in the 2020 cohort had higher ratings self-regulation compared to the pre-pandemic cohort, but not 2021 cohort. There were no differences on attachment ratings between cohorts. Findings suggest that the abrupt halt to ECE programs due to the COVID-19 pandemic impacted US toddlers' cognitive and socioemotional abilities. This underscores the importance of continued high-quality ECE for infants and toddlers from low-income families during disruptive times. Further work is needed to investigate the long-term impacts of experiencing an abrupt halt to ECE due to COVID-19.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV	2024	29	6					983	1001		10.1111/infa.12619	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12619		AUG 2024						39177225					WOS:001296184700001

In three experiments, infants were presented with either ID speech or AD speech as stimuli, followed by highly variable images of inanimate objects as targets. In Experiment 1 (N = 18), images were preceded by ID or AD speech with semantic content ("Look here"). Contrary to hypothesis, targets preceded by AD speech elicited increased amplitude of the Negative central (Nc) component compared to targets preceded by ID speech, indicating increased attention. Experiment 2 (N = 23) explored whether ID versus AD speech influences attention allocation also without semantic content. The same targets were either preceded by human voice sounds without semantic content ("Uh-Ah") following the prosody of either ID or AD speech register. No differences in attention allocation or object processing were observed. Experiment 3 (N = 18) contrasted ID speech with and without semantic content and found enhanced attention allocation following stimuli without semantic content, but increased object processing following stimuli with semantic content. Overall, the effects observed here are consistent with the idea that less familiar speech stimuli increase attention for subsequent objects.

Contingency enables the formation of social expectations about an artificial agent	INFANCY												What environmental regularities support infant communicative learning from social interactions? We propose that infants allocate their attention toward and learn from external events that are contingent on their own behaviors. We tested the robustness of the influence of contingency on communicative learning by using a non-biological stimulus, a remote-controlled car, as the social partner. The car approached infants and produced a speech sound either contingently to infants' vocalizations or on a yoked schedule. Two additional groups had an unfamiliar human experimenter as their social partner in contingent and yoked control conditions. We assessed whether infants formed expectations about their partner's responsiveness to their vocalizations. Expectations made based on contingent responsiveness would support the role of contingency in promoting plasticity in early communicative learning. Infants across all conditions increased their vocalization rates when their partner paused in responding, suggesting that they expected their vocalizations to influence their partners' behavior. Infants vocalized significantly more to the social partner than their caregiver if they received contingent rather than yoked responses from the social partner, regardless of if the partner was a human or non-biological agent. Contingent responses to prelinguistic vocalizations facilitated the formation of expectations for interactivity of social partners.

However, the vast majority of this work has been conducted in North America. We harnessed a unique collection of daylong recordings from Slovenian infants (age: 16-30 months, N = 40, 18 girls), and focus our attention on manually annotated measures of parentese (infant-directed speech with a higher pitch, slower tempo, and exaggerated intonation), conversational turns, infant words, and word combinations. Measures from daylong recordings showed large variation, but were comparable to previous studies with North American samples. Infants heard almost twice as much speech and parentese from mothers compared to fathers, but there were no differences in language input to boys and girls. Positive associations were found between the social-interactional features of language input (parentese, turn-taking) and infants' concurrent language production. Measures of child speech from daylong recordings were positively correlated with measures obtained through the Slovenian MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory. These results support the notion that the social-interactional features of parental language input are the foundation of infants' language skills, even in an environment where infants spend much of their waking hours in childcare settings, as they do in Slovenia.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				OCT	2024	29	5					811	837		10.1111/infa.12615	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12615		JUL 2024						39044327					WOS:001274478200001
J	Orr, E; Rosenbaum, GK				Orr, Edna; Kashy Rosenbaum, Gabriela			"My baby is ready to learn"-The role of infant pointing in redirecting maternal responses to be more informative	INFANCY												Caregivers may perceive pointing as an indication of infants' readiness to learn, thereby increasing their tendency to label objects regardless of the infant's gesture type and context. This was investigated in this study by tracking 35 infants at home at the ages of 11 and 13 months and observing their interactions with their mothers during object manipulation. We focused on four types of communicative gestures: typical giving gestures, gestures contingent on exploration, gestures contingent on play, and pointing. We analyzed maternal response tendencies, including affirmation, naming, discourse, and pretense. The results revealed that when infants reached the age of 13 months, they tripled their pointing production; in turn, the maternal response changed entirely, with naming becoming the preferred response to all types of gestures. Furthermore, when infants were 13 months old and offered an object contingent on play acts, mothers increased their pretense acts sevenfold. Based on the most informative responses to infants among those examined, we argue that an increase in the number of pointing gestures may gradually be associated with the establishment of the maternal perception that an infant is ready to learn and a subsequent increase in naming and pretense production by the mother.

Exploring the relationship between shyness and pointing in the second year	INFANCY												Infants' use of pointing gestures to direct and share attention develops during the first 2 years of life. Shyness, defined as an approach-avoidance motivational conflict during social interactions, may influence infants' use of pointing. Recent research distinguished between positive (gaze and/or head aversions while smiling) and non-positive (gaze and/or head aversions without smiling) shyness, which are related to different social and cognitive skills. We investigated whether positive and non-positive shyness in 12-month-old (n = 38; 15 girls) and 15-month-old (n = 45; 15 girls) infants were associated with their production of pointing gestures. Infants' expressions of shyness were observed during a social-exposure task in which the infant entered the laboratory room in their parent's arms and was welcomed by an unfamiliar person who provided attention and compliments. Infants' pointing was measured with a pointing task involving three stimuli: pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral. Positive shyness was positively associated with overall pointing at 15 months, especially in combination with high levels of non-positive shyness. In addition, infants who displayed more non-positive shyness pointed more frequently to direct the attention of the social partner to an unpleasant (vs. neutral) stimulus at both ages. Results indicate that shyness influences the early use of pointing to emotionally charged stimuli.

Memory as tapped by Deferred imitation (DI) requires that toddlers form a representation of the target actions that they can later use to reproduce the actions and in addition to measuring memory for real live events, it can also be used to measure memory for events viewed through media. Toddlers are frequently exposed to multiple forms of digital media in addition to more traditional forms of picture book reading. In a within-subjects design, memory was assessed with a DI task in 2-year-olds (n = 89) using the Frankfurt Imitation Test. Deferred imitation was assessed after live and video demonstrations. Parents completed a survey about children's media use. Picture book reading for less than 30 min a day predicted lower memory scores for actions demonstrated live. Watching video content for more than 1 h a day predicted lower memory scores for actions demonstrated on video. Results are interpreted in terms of individual differences in experiences of traditional and digital media and the development of symbolic understanding.

Language is embedded in this conversational skill acquired well before it during infancy, through everyday interactions with caregivers. The earliness of this skill and its link with language allows us to test whether social environment shapes early language development. We therefore study turn-taking perception of 6-month-old infants by measuring their gazes during video presentation of three different conversational situations where the turn is explicitly given, normally taken or taken with an overlap. We studied 51 infants to cover several family and infant characteristics: infants' sex, presence of siblings, and family socioeconomic status (SES). We found that infants looked more at the second speaker when she overlapped the first speaker than in the other situations, but not all infants were equally sensitive. Indeed, infants from high-SES families reacted differently to the three situations, while infants from the two lower SES categories did not. Also, only singletons reacted differently by looking more at the second speaker after the overlapping and turn-giving situations, and not after the turn-taking situation. Our results emphasize the importance of early social experiences on language development.

Co-regulation, relationship quality, and infant distress vocalizations observed during mother-infant interactions: Influences of maternal depression and different contexts	INFANCY												Mother-infant interactions are co-regulated and provide the foundation for mother-infant relationship quality. The implications of maternal depression and contextual demands (i.e., reinstating the interaction following maternal unavailability and vocalized infant distress) on observationally coded co-regulation in mother-infant dyads (n = 40) at 4-months was investigated. Associations among co-regulation patterns and mother-infant relationship quality was also examined. Dyads participated in Still-Face (SF) and Separation (SP) procedures, with periods of maternal emotional and physical unavailability. Co-regulation was captured using the Revised Relational Coding System. Relationship quality was examined using the Emotional Availability Scales. Dyads in the depressed group had significantly more unilateral exchanges than the non-depressed group following the SF and SP perturbations. The depressed group also had significantly more distress vocalizations during the SP perturbation than the non-depressed group. Co-regulation in the depressed group was less disrupted by the SF perturbation. Positive relationship quality dimensions (maternal sensitivity, structuring, and infant responsiveness) were associated with more symmetrical and less unilateral co-regulation regardless of the interaction period. There were also context-specific results pertaining to patterns of co-regulation and associated maternal hostility and infant responsiveness. Results highlight co-regulatory differences in depressed mothers and their infants and how these differences are exacerbated by contextual demands.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV	2024	29	6					933	957		10.1111/infa.12617	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12617		JUL 2024						39024126					WOS:001270851300001

Yet, despite the unique communicative function of touch during development, very little is known about infants' sensitivity to the emotional valence of observed touches. To investigate this issue, we measured facial electromyographic (EMG) activity in response to positive (caress) and negative (scratches) observed touches in a sample of 11-month-old infants. Facial EMG activity was measured over the zygomaticus major (ZM) and corrugator supercilii muscles, respectively involved in positive (i.e., smiling) and negative (i.e., frowning) facial expressions. Results have shown distinct activations of the ZM during the observation of scratches and caresses. In particular, significantly greater activation of the ZM (smiling muscle) emerged specifically in response to the observation of caresses compared to scratches. Our finding suggests that, in infancy, observed affective touches can evoke emotional facial reactions.					addabbo, margaret/ABD-5240-2020	addabbo, margaret/0000-0002-8414-6853; turati, chiara/0000-0001-7496-1830													1525-0008	1532-7078				OCT	2024	29	5					660	671		10.1111/infa.12600	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12600		JUN 2024						38873865					WOS:001246053500001
J	Breitfeld, E; Compton, AM; Saffran, JR				Breitfeld, Elise; Compton, Anna M.; Saffran, Jenny R.			Toddlers' prior social experience with speakers influences their word learning	INFANCY												Toddlers prefer to learn from familiar adults, particularly their caregivers, and perform better on word learning tasks when taught by caregivers than by strangers. However, it remains unclear why toddlers learn better from caregivers than from strangers. One possibility is that toddlers are more receptive to learning from individuals whom they have found to be engaging in previous interactions. The current study tested whether toddlers learn more from an unfamiliar adult who was previously engaging than from an unfamiliar adult who was previously unengaging. Toddlers (27-29 months, N = 40) were taught labels for novel objects by two different experimenters. Prior to word learning, toddlers watched pre-recorded videos of one experimenter utilizing engaging behaviors (i.e., using infant-directed speech, gestures, eye contact, and positive affect) and one experimenter utilizing unengaging behaviors (i.e., using adult-directed speech, no gestures, no eye contact, and neutral affect). Both experimenters were equally engaging during labeling. Word learning was then tested using a looking-while-listening paradigm. The results of linear mixed-effects model, cluster-based permutation, and growth curve analyses suggest heightened performance for words that were taught by the experimenter who was previously engaging. These results begin to reveal the kinds of social experiences that promote success in early word learning.

Before the demonstration, the experimenter verbally announced the movement style or the goal. Results showed that verbal action descriptions did not influence infants' imitation. However, matching previous findings, infants imitated the goal more often than the movement in the high-saliency condition, and the movement more often than the goal in the low-saliency condition. Moreover, in the novel medium-saliency condition, infants imitated both components equally often. Thus, selective imitation varied as a function of perceptual goal saliency, but not of verbal cues. This suggests that perceptual features can enhance infants' bottom-up processing and imitation of action components, while the impact of top-down processes based on verbal cues may vary depending on task characteristics and infants' verbal abilities, inducing a need for further research.

The present study examines the development of early cognitive control during the first 24-month. We evaluated a tablet-based assessment of cognitive control among infants aged 18- and 24-month. We also examined concurrent and longitudinal associations between attentional disengagement, general cognitive skills and cognitive control. Participants (N = 60, 30 female) completed the tablet-task at 18- and 24-month of age. Attentional disengagement and general cognitive development were assessed at 5-, 8-, 12-, 18- and 24-month using an eye-tracking measure and the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL), respectively. The cognitive control task demonstrated good internal consistency, sensitivity to age-related change in performance and stable individual differences. No associations were found between infant cognitive control and MSEL scores longitudinally or concurrently. The eye-tracking task revealed that slower attentional disengagement at 8-month, but faster disengagement at 18-month, predicted higher cognitive control scores at 24-month. This task may represent a useful tool for measuring emergent cognitive control. The multifaceted relationship between attention and infant cognitive control suggests that the rapid development of the attentional system in infancy results in distinct attentional skills, at different ages, being relevant for cognitive control development.

Research suggests that two main mechanisms support infants' speech segmentation: prosodic cues like the word stress patterns, and distributional cues like transitional probabilities (TPs). We tested 6-month-old German-learning infants' use of prosodic and statistical cues for speech segmentation in three experiments. In Experiment 1, infants were familiarized with an artificial language string where TPs signaled either word boundaries or iambic words-a stress pattern that is disfavored in German. Experiment 2 was a control and only the test phase was presented. In Experiment 3, prosodic cues were absent in the string and only TPs signaled word boundaries. All experiments included the same conditions at test: disyllabic words with high TPs in the string, words with low TPs and words with non-co-occurring syllables. Results showed that infants relied more strongly on prosodic cues than on TPs for word segmentation. Notably, no segmentation evidence emerged when prosodic cues were absent in the string. This finding underlines early impacts of language-specific structural properties on segmentation mechanisms.

Background TV and infant-family interactions: Insights from home observations	INFANCY												Background television has been found to negatively impact children's language development and self-regulatory skills, possibly due to decreased parent-child interactions. Most of the research on the relationship between background TV and caregiver-child interactions has been conducted in laboratory settings. In the current study, we conducted home observations and investigated whether infants engage in fewer interactions with family members in homes where background TV is more prevalent. We observed 32 infants at the ages of 8, 10, and 18 months in their home environments, coding for dyadic interactions (e.g., parent talking to and/or engaging with the child), triadic interactions (e.g., parent and infant play with a toy together), and infants' individual activities. Our findings revealed that background TV was negatively associated with the time infants spent in triadic interactions, positively associated with time spent engaging in individual activities, and not significantly related to the time spent in dyadic interactions. Apart from the relationship between background TV and individual activity time at 8 months, these associations remained significant even after accounting for families' socioeconomic status. These findings imply a correlation between background TV exposure and caregiver-infant-object interactions, warranting a longitudinal analysis with larger sample sizes.

Caregiver reactions to babbling organize turn-taking interactions: Facilitative effects of vocal versus non-vocal responses	INFANCY												Turn-taking interactions are foundational to the development of social, communicative, and cognitive skills. In infants, vocal turn-taking experience is predictive of infants' socioemotional and language development. However, different forms of turn-taking interactions may have different effects on infant vocalizing. It is presently unknown how caregiver vocal, non-vocal and multimodal responses to infant vocalizations compare in extending caregiver-infant vocal turn-taking bouts. In bouts that begin with an infant vocalization, responses that maintain versus change the communicative modality may differentially affect the likelihood of further infant vocalizing. No studies have examined how caregiver response modalities that either matched or differed from the infant acoustic (vocal) modality might affect the temporal structure of vocal turn-taking beyond the initial serve-and-return exchanges. We video-recorded free-play sessions of 51 caregivers with their 9-month-old infants. Caregivers responded to babbling most often with vocalizations. In turn, caregiver vocal responses were significantly more likely to elicit subsequent infant babbling. Bouts following an initial caregiver vocal response contained significantly more turns than those following a non-vocal or multimodal response. Thus prelinguistic turn-taking is sensitive to the modality of caregivers' responses. Future research should investigate if such sensitivity is grounded in attentional constraints, which may influence the structure of turn-taking interactions.

Around 14-months of age, infants detect incorrect labeling when they are presented with an object which is labeled while still visible. However, things that are referred to are often out of sight when we communicate about them. The present study examined infants' detection of semantic mismatch when the object was occluded at the time of labeling. Specifically, we investigated whether mislabeling that referred to an occluded object could elicit a semantic mismatch. We showed 14-month-old Danish-speaking infants events where an onscreen agent showed an object and then hid it in a box. This was followed by another agent's hand pointing at the box, and a concurrent auditory category label played, which either matched or did not match the hidden object. Our results indicate that there is an effect of semantic mismatch with a larger negativity in incongruent trials. Thus, infants detected a mismatch, as indicated by a larger n400, when occluded objects were mislabeled.

Parent attention-orienting behavior is associated with neural entropy in infancy	INFANCY												Parents use joint attention to direct infants to environmental stimuli. We hypothesized that infants whose parents provide more bids for joint attention will display a more complex neural response when viewing social scenes. Sixty-one 8-month-old infants underwent electroencephalography (EEG) while viewing videos of joint- and parallel-play and participated in a free play interaction. EEG data was analyzed using multiscale entropy, which quantifies neural variability. Free play interactions assessed parent alternating gaze, a behavioral mechanism for directing attention to environmental cues. We found a significant positive association between parent alternating gaze and neural entropy in frontal and central regions. These results suggest a relationship between parent behavior and infant neural mechanisms that regulate social attention, underlying the importance of parental cues in forming neural networks.

The effectiveness of maternal regulatory attempts in the development of infant emotion regulation	INFANCY												Caregivers are instrumental in the development of infant emotion regulation; however, few studies have focused on delineating the real-time effectiveness of strategies that caregivers use to reduce infant distress. It is also unclear whether certain caregiver traits facilitate engagement in more successful regulation strategies. This study addressed these gaps by: (1) examining the differential effectiveness of maternal regulatory attempts (MRAs; behavioral strategies initiated by mothers to assist infants with regulating emotional states) in reducing 12- to 24-month-old infants' frustration during a toy removal task; and (2) assessing whether maternal mind-mindedness (mothers' attunement to their infant's mental state) predicted mothers' selection of MRAs. Multilevel modeling revealed that distraction and control were the most effective MRAs in reducing infant negative affect across 5-s intervals (N = 82 dyads; M infant age = 18 months; 45 females). Greater use of non-attuned mind-related speech predicted less engagement in effective MRAs, supporting a link between caregivers' socio-cognitive skills and provision of in-the-moment regulation support. These findings highlight the value of considering caregiver regulatory behaviors as a target for elucidating how maternal socialization of emotion regulation occurs in real-time. They also underscore mothers' important role as socializing agents in the development of this foundational developmental ability.

J	Lopez, LD; Walle, EA				Lopez, Lukas D.; Walle, Eric A.			Caregiver encouragement to act on objects is related with crawling infants' receptive language	INFANCY												The progression from crawling to walking in infancy is associated with changes in infant language development. One possible explanation for such change is the infant's language environment. Prior research indicates that caregivers use more action directives with walking infants compared to crawling infants, but the relations of such parental speech with infant vocabulary is unknown. Here, we present findings from day-long home audio recordings (Study 1) and laboratory observations (Study 2) of same-aged crawling and walking infants to explore how caregiver language, specifically action directives, were associated with parent reported infant vocabulary size. Findings in both studies indicated that caregiver action directives were associated with crawling, but not walking infants' receptive vocabulary sizes. Specifically, action directives about objects occurring when the infant and caregiver were not jointly engaged were associated with higher receptive vocabulary scores for crawling infants, but no such pattern was found for walking infants. The replication of results in distinct samples with different research methodologies strengthens the findings. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that caregiver social engagement specific to infant motoric development is related with infant language learning.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				JUL	2024	29	4					550	570		10.1111/infa.12592	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12592		MAR 2024						38529523					WOS:001190507600001
J	Tisborn, K; Seehagen, S				Tisborn, Katharina; Seehagen, Sabine			2-Year-olds' free play during the COVID-19 pandemic	INFANCY												Free play is a natural activity in toddlerhood, depending on environmental conditions like available objects and the social environment. The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences for parents' mental health held the potential to change toddlers' play environment. This cross-sectional study investigated 2-year-olds' (N = 97) free play with objects, and aspects of caregiver mental well-being in three cohorts during the pandemic in Germany. Caregivers reported their positive mental health (PMH), threat perception, perception of current family situation from negative to positive, and workload. We categorized toddlers' behavior in free play sessions in their homes with a fixed set of objects through behavioral coding. Play behavior did not differ between cohorts and did not correlate with caregivers' positive mental health, threat perception, and perception of family situation. A MANOVA revealed a significant main effect of cohort on PMH, threat perception and perception of family situation, qualified by two discriminant functions. Full sample analyses revealed that toddlers of caregivers perceiving a workload increase compared to the time before the pandemic showed less pretend play, and less functional and nonfunctional play. The results provide insights into 2-year-olds' play behavior during a global pandemic and highlight the role of caregiver availability for children's play.

Specifically, we examined whether the temporal alignment of words and actions influenced the acquisition of novel word-action-object associations. We used a preferential looking and violation of expectation task in which infants and young children were first presented with two distinct word-object and action-object pairings either in a synchronous (overlapping in time) or sequential manner (one after the other). Findings revealed that 2-year-olds recognized both, action-object and word-object associations when they first saw the word-action-object combinations synchronously, but not sequentially, as evidenced by looking behavior. 1-year-olds did not show evidence for recognition for either of the word-object and action-object pairs, regardless of the initial temporal alignment of these cues. To control for individual differences, we explored factors that might influence associative learning based on parental reports of 1- and 2-year-olds development, however, developmental measures did not explain word-action-object associative learning in either group. We discuss that while young children may benefit from the temporal alignment of multisensory cues as it enables them to actively engage with the multisensory content in real-time, infants may have been overwhelmed by the complexity of this input.

Parental sensitivity and intrusiveness with mothers and fathers: Associations between parental behavioral activation/inhibition and infant temperament	INFANCY												Understanding the factors contributing to sensitive parenting is crucial to optimize infant social and emotional functioning. Research has supported the association between parents' personality and parenting quality, but findings are inconsistent when examining various global personality measures. Further, it is likely that the interaction between parent-level (e.g., personality) and infant-level characteristics (e.g., temperament) are more strongly associated with caregiving quality. Most studies examining predictors of parenting quality have only included mothers, compared to fathers. The current study examined the interaction between parental personality and infant temperament and associations with parental sensitivity and intrusiveness with mothers and fathers. The participants included families (n = 102) when the infants were 4, 6, and 8 months old. Using parent report measures and a face-to-face play task, significant main effects of maternal behavioral inhibition on parenting behaviors were observed for mothers. A Behavioral Activation X Infant Negative Reactivity interaction predicted both maternal sensitivity and intrusiveness, whereas a Behavioral Inhibition X Infant Surgency predicted paternal intrusiveness. In summary, the results revealed support for the goodness-of-fit perspective between parents' personality and infant temperament.

Prenatal influences on postnatal neuroplasticity: Integrating DOHaD and sensitive/critical period frameworks to understand biological embedding in early development	INFANCY												Early environments can have significant and lasting effects on brain, body, and behavior across the lifecourse. Here, we address current research efforts to understand how experiences impact neurodevelopment with a new perspective integrating two well-known conceptual frameworks - the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) and sensitive/critical period frameworks. Specifically, we consider how prenatal experiences characterized in the DOHaD model impact two key neurobiological mechanisms of sensitive/critical periods for adapting to and learning from the postnatal environment. We draw from both animal and human research to summarize the current state of knowledge on how particular prenatal substance exposures (psychoactive substances and heavy metals) and nutritional profiles (protein-energy malnutrition and iron deficiency) each differentially impact brain circuits' excitation/GABAergic inhibition balance and myelination. Finally, we highlight new research directions that emerge from this integrated framework, including testing how prenatal environments alter sensitive/critical period timing and learning and identifying potential promotional/buffering prenatal exposures to impact postnatal sensitive/critical periods. We hope this integrative framework considering prenatal influences on postnatal neuroplasticity will stimulate new research to understand how early environments have lasting consequences on our brains, behavior, and health.

J	Quam, C; Swingley, D				Quam, Carolyn; Swingley, Daniel			Developmental change in English-learning children's interpretations of salient pitch contours in word learning	INFANCY												To efficiently recognize words, children learning an intonational language like English should avoid interpreting pitch-contour variation as signaling lexical contrast, despite the relevance of pitch at other levels of structure. Thus far, the developmental time-course with which English-learning children rule out pitch as a contrastive feature has been incompletely characterized. Prior studies have tested diverse lexical contrasts and have not tested beyond 30 months. To specify the developmental trajectory over a broader age range, we extended a prior study (Quam & Swingley, 2010), in which 30-month-olds and adults disregarded pitch changes, but attended to vowel changes, in newly learned words. Using the same phonological contrasts, we tested 3- to 5-year-olds, 24-month-olds, and 18-month-olds. The older two groups were tested using the language-guided-looking method. The oldest group attended to vowels but not pitch. Surprisingly, 24-month-olds ignored not just pitch but sometimes vowels as well-conflicting with prior findings of phonological constraint at 24 months. The youngest group was tested using the Switch habituation method, half with additional phonetic variability in training. Eighteen-month-olds learned both pitch-contrasted and vowel-contrasted words, whether or not additional variability was present. Thus, native-language phonological constraint was not evidenced prior to 30 months (Quam & Swingley, 2010). We contextualize our findings within other recent work in this area.

Despite increasing efforts to study gesture use in diverse contexts, most of our knowledge on the role of gesture is largely based on populations of Western countries. In this study, we add to the growing body of international research by examining gesture use by 31 mothers and their 14-month-old infants (12 girls) in South Korea and investigate the gestures used during interaction, and whether early gesture use at 14 months predicts Korean children's later language skills at 36 months. The results showed that in addition to using gestures observed in other cultural contexts, Korean mother-child dyads used culturally specific gesture (i.e., bowing), showing an early sign of socialization that starts with preverbal children. In addition, Korean infants' index-finger pointing, but not showing and giving, predicted their later receptive and expressive vocabulary skills at 36 months, providing additional support for the importance of pointing in early language development.

We studied individual differences in 5-month-old infants' (N = 517) sustained attention to faces and preference for emotional faces. We assessed the contribution of genetic and environmental influences to individual differences in these gaze behaviors, and the association between these traits and other concurrent and later phenotypes. We found an association between the mean duration of looking at a face (before looking away from it) at 5 months and socio-communicative abilities at 14 months (beta = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.08; 0.26, p < 0.001). Sustained attention to faces predicted socio-communicative abilities over and above variance captured by mean fixation duration. We also found a statistically significant but weak tendency to prefer looking at smiling faces (relative to neutral faces), but no indication that variability in this behavior was explained by genetic effects. Moderate heritability was found for sustained attention to faces (A = 0.23, CI: 0.06; 0.38), while shared environmental influences were non-significant for both phenotypes. These findings suggest that sustained looking at individual faces before looking away is a developmentally significant 'social attention' phenotype in infancy, characterized by moderate heritability and a specific relation to later socio-communicative abilities.					; Ronald, Angelica/C-7812-2009	Viktorsson, Charlotte/0000-0003-2727-2957; Ronald, Angelica/0000-0002-9576-2176													1525-0008	1532-7078				MAY	2024	29	3					459	478		10.1111/infa.12586	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12586		FEB 2024						38358338					WOS:001162772900001
J	Khoury, JE; Atkinson, L; Gonzalez, A				Khoury, Jennifer E.; Atkinson, Leslie; Gonzalez, Andrea			A longitudinal study examining the associations between prenatal and postnatal maternal distress and toddler socioemotional developmental during the COVID-19 pandemic	INFANCY												Elevated psychological distress, experienced by pregnant women and parents, has been well-documented during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most research focuses on the first 6-months postpartum, with single or limited repeated measures of perinatal distress. The present longitudinal study examined how perinatal distress, experienced over nearly 2 years of the COVID-19 pandemic, impacted toddler socioemotional development. A sample of 304 participants participated during pregnancy, 6-weeks, 6-months, and 15-months postpartum. Mothers reported their depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, at each timepoint. Mother-reported toddler socioemotional functioning (using the Brief Infant-Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment) was measured at 15-months. Results of structural equation mediation models indicated that (1) higher prenatal distress was associated with elevated postpartum distress, from 6-weeks to 15-months postpartum; (2) associations between prenatal distress and toddler socioemotional problems became nonsignificant after accounting for postpartum distress; and (3) higher prenatal distress was indirectly associated with greater socioemotional problems, and specifically elevated externalizing problems, through higher maternal distress at 6 weeks and 15 months postpartum. Findings suggest that the continued experience of distress during the postpartum period plays an important role in child socioemotional development during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cross-task stability can help us understand developmental processes, including how risks such as preterm birth affect outcomes. We investigated cross-task stability of attention control in 32 preterm and 39 term infants. All infants had the same chronological age at time of testing (5 months) but varied in gestational age (GA) at birth (30-42 weeks). Infants completed an experimental attention following task with a researcher and a naturalistic play observation with their mothers. Both preterm and term infants demonstrated attention following in the experimental task. GA and flexibility of attention were related: the likelihood of no turn trials decreased with increasing GA. To evaluate cross-task stability, we compared attention performance in the experimental and naturalistic settings. Flexible attention shifts on the experimental task were positively related to attention to objects in the naturalistic observation. Furthermore, the association between flexible attention shifts on the experimental task and attention to objects in the naturalistic observation was moderated by GA. Our study provides initial evidence that the consolidation of attention control increases with GA. These findings highlight the value of comparing experimental and observational measures of attention.

COVID-19 pandemic effects: Examining prenatal internalizing symptoms and infant temperament	INFANCY												For pregnant women, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented stressors, including uncertainty regarding prenatal care and the long-term consequences of perinatal infection. However, few studies have examined the role of this adverse event on maternal wellbeing and infant socioemotional development following the initial wave of the pandemic when less stringent public health restrictions were in place. The current study addressed these gaps in the literature by first comparing prenatal internalizing symptoms and infant temperament collected after the first wave of the pandemic to equivalent measures in a pre-pandemic sample. Second, associations between prenatal pandemic-related stress and infant temperament were examined. Women who were pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic endorsed higher pregnancy-specific anxiety relative to the pre-pandemic sample. They also reported greater infant negative emotionality and lower positive affectivity and regulatory capacity at 2 months postpartum. Prenatal infection stress directly predicted infant negative affect. Both prenatal infection and preparedness stress were indirectly related to infant negative emotionality through depression symptoms during pregnancy and at 2 months postpartum. These results have implications for prenatal mental health screening procedures during the pandemic and the development of early intervention programs for infants born to mothers during this adverse event.

Infants&apos; and adults&apos; perception of different pointing gestures	INFANCY												Adults and infants as young as 4 months old orient to pointing gestures. Although adults are shown to orient faster to index-finger pointing than other hand shapes, it is unknown whether hand shapes influence infants' perception of pointing. In this study, we used a spatial cueing paradigm on an eye tracker to investigate whether and to what extent adults and 12-month-old infants orient their attention in the direction of pointing gestures with different hand shapes: index finger, whole hand, and pinky finger. Furthermore, we assessed infants' and their parents' pointing production. Results revealed that adults showed a reliable cueing effect: shorter saccadic reaction times (SRTs) to congruent than incongruent targets, for all hand shapes. However, they did not show a larger cueing effect triggered by the index or any other finger. This contradicts previous findings and is discussed with respect to the differences in methodology. Infants showed a cueing effect only for the whole hand but not for the index or pinky fingers. The current results suggest that infants' orienting to pointing may be more robust for the whole hand shape in the first year, and tuning in to the social-communicative relevance of the canonical index finger shape may develop later or require additional social-communicative cues.

Expanding on this literature using naturalistic home-recorded data and parental vocabulary reports, we find that early language outcomes vary by number of siblings in a sample of 43 English-learning U.S. children from mid-to-high socioeconomic status homes. More specifically, we find that children in our sample with two or more-but not one-older siblings had smaller productive vocabularies at 18 months, and heard less input from caregivers across several measures than their peers with less than two siblings. We discuss implications regarding what infants experience and learn across a range of family sizes in infancy.

The role of local meaning in infants' fixations of natural scenes	INFANCY												As infants view visual scenes every day, they must shift their eye gaze and visual attention from location to location, sampling information to process and learn. Like adults, infants' gaze when viewing natural scenes (i.e., photographs of everyday scenes) is influenced by the physical features of the scene image and a general bias to look more centrally in a scene. However, it is unknown how infants' gaze while viewing such scenes is influenced by the semantic content of the scenes. Here, we tested the relative influence of local meaning, controlling for physical salience and center bias, on the eye gaze of 4- to 12-month-old infants (N = 92) as they viewed natural scenes. Overall, infants were more likely to fixate scene regions rated as higher in meaning, indicating that, like adults, the semantic content, or local meaning, of scenes influences where they look. More importantly, the effect of meaning on infant attention increased with age, providing the first evidence for an age-related increase in the impact of local meaning on infants' eye movements while viewing natural scenes.

J	Shinskey, JL				Shinskey, Jeanne L.			Developmental trajectories of picture-based object representations during the first year of life	INFANCY												Experience with an object's photograph changes 9-month-olds' preference for the referent object, confirming they can represent objects from pictures. However, picture-based representations appear weaker than object-based representations. The current study's first objective was to investigate age differences in object recognition memory after familiarization with objects' pictures. The second objective was to test whether age differences in object permanence sensitivity with picture-based representations match those found with object-based representations, whereby 7-month-olds search more for familiar hidden objects but 11-month-olds search more for novel ones. Six- and 11-month-olds were familiarized with an object's photo and tested on their representation of the real object by comparing their reaching for it versus a novel object. Objects were visible under conditions testing recognition memory and hidden under conditions testing object permanence. Like 9-month-olds, 6- and 11-month-olds preferred novelty with visible objects, showing early object recognition after picture familiarization, as well as developmental continuity. Unlike 9-month-olds, who switched to preferring familiarity with hidden objects, 6- and 11-month-olds switched to null preference. This pattern fails to match 7- and 11-month-olds' hidden-object preferences after familiarization with real objects, revealing discontinuity in sensitivity to object permanence after picture familiarization, and suggesting that picture-based representations are weaker than object-based ones.

From very early in life, infants have to combine a multitude of sensory features with social and affective attributes. Of all senses, touch constitutes a privileged channel to carry affective-motivational meanings and foster social connection. In the present study, we investigate whether sharing sensory stimulation that varies for its affective value differentially affects infants' attention towards visual stimuli. 6 to 11-month-old infants (N = 42) were familiarized with two characters respectively matched with tactile (affective or non-affective) and auditory stimulation; then repeatedly exposed to scenes where the two characters moved towards target objects. Our results showed a main effect of stimulation (sound vs. touch) on looking times during familiarization, with longer looking times when sound is provided. During scenes presentation, a main effect of the type of touch (affective vs. non affective) emerged, with longer looking times in infants that previously experienced affective touch, suggesting that this sensory experience may critically engage the self and modulate infant attention. Overall, these findings suggest that while sound acts as attention getter, affective touch supports sustained attention towards complex visual scenes beyond the stimulation period itself.

The current study explored whether early emerging deficits in emotion processing are associated with disruptions in the development of empathy and prosociality. We investigated this question in a large, diverse sample of 147, 11- to 20-month-old infants (42% female; 61% Black; 67% low socioeconomic status). Infants completed two observational tasks assessing prosocial helping and one task assessing empathy and prosocial comforting behavior. Infants also completed an eye-tracking task assessing engagement and disengagement with negative emotional faces. Infants who attended less to angry, sad, and fearful faces (i.e., by being slower to look at and/or quicker to look away from negative compared to neutral faces) engaged in fewer helping behaviors, and effect sizes were larger when examining infants' attention toward the eye regions of faces. Additionally, infants who were quicker to look away from the eye regions of angry faces, but not the whole face, displayed less empathy and comforting behaviors. Results suggest that as early as 12 months of age, infants' decreased attention toward negative emotional faces, particularly the eye regions, is associated with less empathy and prosociality during a developmental period in which these abilities are rapidly maturing.

J	Dafreville, M; Guidetti, M; Bourjade, M				Dafreville, Mawa; Guidetti, Michele; Bourjade, Marie			Patterns of attention-sensitive communication contribute to 7-20-month-olds' emerging pragmatic skills	INFANCY												The present study aimed at investigating the ability of 7- to 20-month-old infants to display attention-sensitive communication using either canonical markers of language acquisition (e.g., pointing gestures, canonical babblings) or other signals based on the physical features actually perceived by the mother in everyday interaction (e.g., body movements, mouth sounds). We studied 30 French mother-infant dyads in naturalistic settings. We assessed the infants' attention-sensitive communication through unimodal and cross-modal adjustment, defined as the capacity of infants to address visually inattentive mothers by avoiding visual communication mismatches and/or favoring communication matches through audible-or-contact signals. Unimodal and cross-modal adjustments were tested for specific signals across spontaneous "conditions" of maternal visual attention (attentive/inattentive) from video footage filmed in the home. Both canonical markers of language development and signals belonging to an extended repertoire of communication were used by infants to adjust to their mother's visual attention. Gaze-coordinated signals were overall not significantly better adjusted to maternal attention than non-gaze-coordinated signals, except for specific silent-visual signals at certain ages. Overall, these results indicate that attention-sensitive communication is relevant to the development of early pragmatic skills and that the intentional use of signals may be more reliably approximated by this capacity than by gaze-coordination with signals.

Longitudinal associations between parents&apos; prosocial behavior and media use and young children&apos;s prosocial development: The mediating role of children&apos;s media use	INFANCY												Research has found that media is associated with children's prosocial behavior (PB) from an early age, and that parents play a key role in children's media use and behavior. However, few studies explore these relations as early as infancy while also controlling for well-established predictors of PB (e.g., empathic concern). Thus, the present study examined longitudinal associations between parents' PB and media use, and prosocial development during early childhood, mediated by children's own media use. Participants were 519 children (M age at Time 1 = 17.77 months) and parents who participated in three timepoints of an ongoing, longitudinal study. A longitudinal path model suggested that children's media use was still significantly associated with PB 1 year later after accounting for factors such as parents' PB, media use, and empathy. These findings have important implications for the early development of behaviors that serve as a foundation for social and moral development.

We also aimed to study whether these associations varied by socioeconomic status (SES). Participants were 179 parent-infant dyads, recruited from well-baby clinic services during routine visits. Child development measures included standardized measures of developmental milestones as assessed by professionals and referral data to child developmental centers. Both measures were retrieved from the official health maintenance organization records by an expert in child development. Results indicated that screen exposure at 6 and 12 months was associated with a higher risk for language/communication deficits at 36 months in children with moderate or high SES but not in children with low SES. Our findings are consistent with existing literature demonstrating cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between early screen exposure and language development deficits. Given that media use practices and motivations vary among families from different backgrounds, further investigation of the interaction between SES and screen exposure is needed.

Attachment security and problematic media use in infancy: A longitudinal study in the United States	INFANCY												Media use during childhood has quickly become a norm across the United States and in other countries. One area still not well understood is the development of problematic (or maladaptive and disruptive) media use in children. This research examines the role of attachment security as a central component in the development of problematic media use over time in a sample of 248 parent-child dyads (9.50% African American, 20.66% Hispanic, 62.81% White, 2.07% Asian, 4.96% other ethnicities). We examined the relationship between attachment security and problematic media use one and 2 years later. We then constructed a mediation model examining parent responsiveness while jointly engaging in media use and during play as mediators between infant attachment security and problematic media use over time. Results suggest that while infant attachment security may be protective against developing problematic media use patterns, this relationship does not seem to be mediated by parent-child interactions while engaging in media or during play.

J	van der Meer, ALH				van der Meer, Audrey L. H.			Handedness as a major determinant of lateral bias in human functional cradling	INFANCY												Studies examining infant cradling have almost uniformly concluded with a general human left-side bias for cradling, indicating that people prefer to hold an infant to the left of their body. Explanations for the notion of the left-side cradling bias have traditionally been searched for in a variety of factors, for example, in terms of maternal heartbeat, genetic factors, in the form of an ear asymmetry where auditory information is perceived faster through the left ear, as a result of a right hemispheric functional specialization for perception of emotions and faces, and in identifying a motor bias of the infant, such as the tendency of newborn infants to lie with the face to the right when placed supine. Interestingly, handedness is generally considered an inadequate explanation for the lateralized cradling bias, despite it being an intuitively plausible one. In this brief review, I put forward the cradler's handedness as the most convincing and elegant determinant of the cradling bias. This explanation is consistent with a developmental cascades' framework where the cradling bias can be understood as the result of a multitude of factors across a range of levels and systems.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAR	2024	29	2					84	94		10.1111/infa.12572	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12572		DEC 2023						38100601					WOS:001124874000001

We report on an ecologically-valid analysis of speech experienced over the course of a day by young children (N = 24, 6-58 months old, 33% female) in a forager-horticulturalist population of lowland Bolivia. A permissive definition of input (i.e., including overlapping, background, and non-linguistic vocalizations) leads to massive changes in terms of input quantity, including a quadrupling of the estimate for overall input compared to a restrictive definition (only near and clear speech), while who talked to and around a focal child is relatively stable across input definitions. We discuss implications of these results for theoretical and empirical research into language acquisition.

However, it remains unclear how infants' social learning behavior is affected when both information are provided simultaneously. Hence, the current study investigated whether and how infants' social learning in terms of gaze following is influenced by face race and language origin of an interaction partner in an uncertain situation. Our sample consisted of 91 Caucasian infants from German speaking families. They were divided into 2 age groups: Younger infants were 5- to 8-month-old (n = 46) and the older infants 11- to 20-month-old (n = 45). We used a modified online version of the gaze following paradigm by Xiao and colleagues by varying face race (Caucasian, and Asian faces) and language (German and French) of a female actor. We recorded infants looking behavior via webcam and coded it offline. Our results revealed that older but not younger infants were biased to follow the gaze of own-race adults speaking their native language. Our findings show that older infants are clearly influenced by adults' ethnicity and language in social learning situations of uncertainty.

However, the reach action sequence does not begin after the initiation of a reach but rather includes the initial visual fixations onto the target object occurring before the reach. We developed a paradigm that synchronizes head-mounted eye-tracking and motion capture to determine whether the latency between the first visual fixation on a target object and the first reaching movement toward the object predicts subsequent reaching behavior in toddlers. In a corpus of over one hundred reach sequences produced by 17 toddlers, we found that longer fixation-reach latencies during the pre-reach phase predicted slower reaches. If the slowness of an executed reach indicates reach difficulty, then the duration of pre-reach planning would be correlated with reach difficulty. However, no relation was found with pre-reach planning duration when reach difficulty was measured by usual factors and independent of reach duration. The findings raise important questions about the measurement of reach difficulty, models of motor control, and possible developmental changes in the relations between pre-planning and continuously unfolding motor plans throughout an action sequence.

To date, no studies have explored whether newborns differentiate BM that approaches rather than withdraws from them. Yet, approach and withdrawal are two fundamental motivations in the socio-emotional world, key to developing empathy and prosocial behavior. Through a looking-behavior paradigm, we demonstrated that a few hours after birth, a human figure approaching attracted more visual attention than a human figure receding, showing that newborns are attuned to PLDs of others moving toward rather than walking away from them. Further, a withdrawing body appears to be less attractive than withdrawing scrambled points. Altogether, these observations support the existence of an early predisposition toward social closeness that might have its roots in an evolutionary perspective.

However, there is a lack of systematic research comparing remote web-based eye-tracking with in-lab eye-tracking in young children. We report a multi-lab study that compared these two measures in an anticipatory looking task with toddlers using WebGazer.js and jsPsych. Results of our remotely tested sample of 18-27-month-old toddlers (N = 125) revealed that web-based eye-tracking successfully captured goal-based action predictions, although the proportion of the goal-directed anticipatory looking was lower compared to the in-lab sample (N = 70). As expected, attrition rate was substantially higher in the web-based (42%) than the in-lab sample (10%). Excluding trials based on visual inspection of the match of time-locked gaze coordinates and the participant's webcam video overlayed on the stimuli was an important preprocessing step to reduce noise in the data. We discuss the use of this remote web-based method in comparison with other current methodological innovations. Our study demonstrates that remote web-based eye-tracking can be a useful tool for testing toddlers, facilitating recruitment of larger and more diverse samples; a caveat to consider is the larger drop-out rate.

Music has been associated with infant self-regulation and may be an intervention strategy for enhancing EC during toddlerhood. This investigation included 32 parent-child dyads from a previously conducted randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants (9-15-months old at baseline) attended either a music enrichment program or a playdate control once a week for 1 year and monthly for an additional year. At age 3, participants completed snack and gift delay effortful control tasks. Groups were compared using one-way ANOVA. We found that participants in the music group had a significantly higher score during snack delay (music mean = 3.47 +/- 0.94; control mean = 2.45 +/- 1.51; p = 0.03; Cohen's d = 0.84). We did not find a significant group difference for latency to peek (music mean = 39.10 +/- 20.10; control mean = 30.90 +/- 19.88; p = 0.25; d = 0.57) or latency to touch (music mean = 105.73 +/- 417.69; control mean = 98.35 +/- 28.84; p = 0.38; d = 0.29) for the gift task. This study provides initial evidence that early participation in a music enrichment program may benefit later development of EC. This study is registered at (NCT02936284).

We found that bilingual toddlers' vocabulary sizes in English were smaller than the vocabulary sizes of their monolingual peers. Notably, this vocabulary gap was not found when groups were compared on conceptual vocabulary in comprehension. Conceptual scoring also reduced the vocabulary gap in production but group differences were still significant. Bilingual toddlers knew more words than monolinguals when words across their two languages were added together, for both comprehension and production. This large total vocabulary size could be attributed to a high proportion of doublets (cross-linguistic word pairs with the same meaning) in bilinguals' vocabularies. These findings are discussed in relation to language exposure, facilitation from cross-linguistic overlap and maturation constraints on vocabulary size.

We measured monthly from 8 to 12 months infants' (N = 56) index-finger pointing frequency along with several candidate correlates: (1) family socioeconomic status (SES), (2) mothers' pointing production, and (3) infants' point following to targets in front of and behind them. Results revealed that (1) infants increased their pointing frequency across age, but high-SES infants had a steeper increase, and a higher pointing frequency than low-SES infants from 10 months onward, (2) maternal pointing frequency was not associated with infant pointing frequency at any age, (3) infants' point following abilities to targets behind their visual fields was positively associated with their pointing frequency at 12 months, after pointing had already emerged around 10 months. Findings suggest that family SES impacts infants' pointing development more generally, not just through maternal pointing. The association between pointing and following points to targets behind, but not in front, suggests that a higher level of referential understanding emerges after, and perhaps through the production of pointing.

This study aimed to analyze the association between positive and negative coparenting previous to the COVID-19 pandemic and infant regulatory capacity in the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic, an adverse condition. A sample of 71 first-born infants and their mothers and fathers from a longitudinal cohort in Portugal were assessed at 2 weeks postpartum before the COVID-19 pandemic and again at 6 months postpartum, before (n = 35) or during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 36). Parents completed measures of positive and negative coparenting and infant regulatory capacity in both assessment waves. Results revealed that the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic moderates the association between mothers' and fathers' positive coparenting previous to the COVID-19 pandemic and infant regulatory capacity at 6 months. The association between positive coparenting and regulatory capacity was stronger in infants facing the COVID-19 pandemic, than in infants who did not face the COVID-19 pandemic. Positive coparenting previous to the COVID-19 pandemic may be a development-enhancing environment for infant regulatory capacity in the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Positive coparenting may buffer regulatory problems in infants facing adverse conditions.

Evidence of tactile arm stepping in newborns and its responsiveness to optic flows specifying self-translation	INFANCY												Although the arms participate in many forms of human locomotion, we know very little about when arm movements emerge during locomotor development. Here we investigated whether newborns would make tactile arm stepping movements when we supported them almost horizontally so their hands touched a surface and blocked their leg movements. Building off prior work showing that newborns make more crawling and air stepping leg movements when exposed to optic flows specifying forward and backward self-translation, we also examined whether newborns would make more tactile arm steps when exposed to forward and backward optic flows compared to a random optic flow that did not specify translation. We found that newborns can perform arm stepping and produce a significantly higher number of tactile arm steps in the optic flow condition specifying backward translation than in the random optic flow condition. Both translating optic flow conditions had significantly higher numbers of alternating arm steps than the random optic flow condition. These findings show that tactile arm stepping exists at birth and that optic flows can facilitate their production, similar to leg stepping. We argue that these results further support the idea that a quadrupedal organization underlies early upright stepping.

Relation of infants&apos; and mothers&apos; pointing to infants&apos; vocabulary measured directly and with parental reports	INFANCY												Infants' and parents' pointing gestures predict infants' concurrent and prospective language development. Most studies have measured vocabulary size using parental reports. However, parents tend to underestimate or overestimate infants' vocabulary necessitating the use of direct measures alongside parent reports. The present study examined whether mothers' index-finger pointing, and infants' whole-hand and index-finger pointing at 14 months associate with infants' receptive and expressive vocabulary based on parental reports and directly measured lexical processing efficiency (LPE) concurrently at 14 months and prospectively at 18 months. We used the decorated room paradigm to measure pointing frequency, the Turkish communicative development inventory I to measure infants' receptive vocabulary, Turkish communicative development inventory II to measure their expressive vocabulary, and the Looking-While-Listening (LWL) task to measure LPE. At 14 months, 34 mother-infant dyads, and at 18 months, 30 dyads were included in the analyses. We found that only infants' index-finger pointing frequency at 14 months predicted their LPE (both reaction time and accuracy) prospectively at 18 months but not concurrently at 14 months. Neither maternal pointing nor infants' pointing predicted their receptive and expressive vocabulary based on indirect measurement. The results extend the evidence on the relation between index-finger pointing and language development to a more direct measure of vocabulary.

The study included 36 infants who were followed as part of a longitudinal study of at-risk infants but were not determined to need care in the neonatal intesive care unit at birth. Both mastery behaviors of persistence and success showed a statistically significant effect of age, while social behaviors remained stable from 7 to 22 months. Social behaviors at 7 and 10 months were correlated with persistence at 22 months and success at 16 to 22 months demonstrating that early social referencing predicts object mastery behaviors in later infancy. Further research should determine if this trend extends to early childhood.

Automated measurement of infant and mother Duchenne facial expressions in the Face-to-Face/Still-Face	INFANCY												Although still-face effects are well-studied, little is known about the degree to which the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) is associated with the production of intense affective displays. Duchenne smiling expresses more intense positive affect than non-Duchenne smiling, while Duchenne cry-faces express more intense negative affect than non-Duchenne cry-faces. Forty 4-month-old infants and their mothers completed the FFSF, and key affect-indexing facial Action Units (AUs) were coded by expert Facial Action Coding System coders for the first 30 s of each FFSF episode. Computer vision software, automated facial affect recognition (AFAR), identified AUs for the entire 2-min episodes. Expert coding and AFAR produced similar infant and mother Duchenne and non-Duchenne FFSF effects, highlighting the convergent validity of automated measurement. Substantive AFAR analyses indicated that both infant Duchenne and non-Duchenne smiling declined from the FF to the SF, but only Duchenne smiling increased from the SF to the RE. In similar fashion, the magnitude of mother Duchenne smiling changes over the FFSF were 2-4 times greater than non-Duchenne smiling changes. Duchenne expressions appear to be a sensitive index of intense infant and mother affective valence that are accessible to automated measurement and may be a target for future FFSF research.

An object's categorizability impacts whether infants encode surface features into their object representations	INFANCY												Infants encode the surface features of simple, unfamiliar objects (e.g., red triangle) and the categorical identities of familiar, categorizable objects (e.g., car) into their representations of these objects. We asked whether 16-18-month-olds ignore non-diagnostic surface features (e.g., color) in favor of encoding an object's categorical identity (e.g., car) when objects are from familiar categories. In Experiment 1 (n = 18), we hid a categorizable object inside an opaque box. In No Switch trials, infants retrieved the object that was hidden. In Switch trials, infants retrieved a different object: an object from a different category (Between-Category-Switch trials) or a different object from the same category (Within-Category-Switch trials). We measured infants' subsequent searching in the box. Infants' pattern of searching suggested that only infants who completed a Within-Category-Switch trial as their first Switch trial encoded objects' surface features, and an exploratory analysis suggested that infants who completed a Between-Category-Switch trial as their first Switch trial only encoded objects' categories. In Experiment 2 (n = 18), we confirmed that these results were due to objects' categorizability. These results suggest infants may tailor the way they encode categorizable objects depending on which object dimensions are perceived to be task relevant.

The paucity of reliable behavioral instruments for this age group prompted the development of a new touchscreen language screener for 2-year-olds that relies on language comprehension. Developmental literature guided selection of age-appropriate markers of language disorder risk that are culturally and dialectally neutral and could be reliably assessed. Items extend beyond products of linguistic knowledge (vocabulary and syntax) and tap the process by which children learn language, also known as fast mapping. After piloting an extensive set of items (139), two phases of testing with over 500 children aged 2; 0-2; 11 were conducted to choose the final 40-item set. Rasch analysis was used to select the best fitting and least redundant items. Norms were created based on 270 children. Sufficient test-retest reliability, Cronbach's alpha, and convergent validity with the MB-CDI and PPVT are reported. This quick behavioral measure of language capabilities could support research studies and facilitate the early detection of language problems.

Persistent symptoms of maternal post-traumatic stress following childbirth across the first months postpartum: Associations with perturbations in maternal behavior and infant avoidance of social gaze toward mother	INFANCY												Recent literature identifies childbirth as a potentially traumatic event, following which mothers may develop symptoms of Post-Traumatic-Stress-Following-Child-birth (PTS-FC). The current study examines whether stable symptoms of PTS-FC during the early postpartum period may impose risk for perturbations in maternal behavior and infant social-engagement with mother, controlling for comorbid postpartum internalizing symptoms. Mother-infant dyads (N = 192) were recruited from the general population, during the third trimester of pregnancy. 49.5% of the mothers were primipara, and 48.4% of the infants were girls. Maternal PTS-FC was assessed at 3-day, 1-month and 4-month postpartum, via self-report and clinician-administered interview. Latent Profile Analysis generated two profiles of symptomology: "Stable-High-PTS-FC" (17.0%), and "Stable-Low-PTS-FC" (83%). Membership in the "Stable-High-PTS-FC" profile associated with perturbed maternal sensitivity, which was in turn significantly associated with infant avoidance of social gaze toward mother (Indirect effect beta = -0.15). Results suggest the need for early screening and inform the planning of early preventive interventions.

Relations between maternal psychosocial risk factors and PRF were investigated in a community sample. A sample of mothers (n = 146) was assessed for risk factors when infants were 6 months, infant temperament was assessed using an observational measure, and PRF was assessed with the Parent Development Interview-Revised (PDI). PRF was measured again with the Parental Reflective Functioning Questionnaire (PRFQ) when children were 4 years (n = 105) and 5 years (n = 92), with an additional sample of mothers (n = 48) tested at these two timepoints. Results showed that in infancy, total maternal psychosocial risk related to lower PDI-PRF; regression analyses highlighted low socioeconomic status, unplanned pregnancy, and low maternal anxiety as independent predictors of lower PDI-PRF. PDI-PRF scores at 6 months did not relate to PRFQ scores, but PRFQ subscales showed stability over time from age 4-5. Results are discussed with regard to the impact of maternal psychosocial risk and infant temperament on PRF and the stability and concordance of PRF measures.

Diversity and representation in infant research: Barriers and bridges toward a globalized science of infant development	INFANCY												Psychological researchers have become increasingly concerned with generalized accounts of human behavior based on narrow participant representation. This concern is particularly germane to infant research as findings from infant studies are often invoked to theorize broadly about the origins of human behavior. In this article, we examined participant diversity and representation in research published on infant development in four journals over the past decade. Sociodemographic data were coded for all articles reporting infant data published in Child Development, Developmental Science, Developmental Psychology, and Infancy between 2011 and 2022. Analyses of 1682 empirical articles, sampling approximately 1 million participants, revealed consistent under-reporting of sociodemographic information. For studies that reported sociodemographic characteristics, there was an unwavering skew toward White infants from North America/Western Europe. To address a lack of diversity in infant studies and its scientific impact, a set of principles and practices are proposed to advance toward a more globally representative science.

Social motivation predicts gaze following between 6 and 14 months	INFANCY												Infants vary in their ability to follow others' gazes, but it is unclear how these individual differences emerge. We tested whether social motivation levels in early infancy predict later gaze following skills. We longitudinally tracked infants' (N = 82) gazes and pupil dilation while they observed videos of a woman looking into the camera simulating eye contact (i.e., mutual gaze) and then gazing toward one of two objects, at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 14 months of age. To improve measurement validity, we used confirmatory factor analysis to combine multiple observed measures to index the underlying constructs of social motivation and gaze following. Infants' social motivation-indexed by their speed of social orienting, duration of mutual gaze, and degree of pupil dilation during mutual gaze-was developmentally stable and positively predicted the development of gaze following-indexed by their proportion of time looking to the target object, first object look difference scores, and first face-to-object saccade difference scores-from 6 to 14 months of age. These findings suggest that infants' social motivation likely plays a role in the development of gaze following and highlight the use of a multi-measure approach to improve measurement sensitivity and validity in infancy research.

Effects of face masks on language comprehension in bilingual children	INFANCY												Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many children receive language input through face coverings. The impact of face coverings for children's abilities to understand language remains unclear. Past research with monolingual children suggests that hearing words through surgical masks does not disrupt word recognition, but hearing words through transparent face shields proves more challenging. In this study, we investigated effects of different face coverings (surgical masks and transparent face shields) on language comprehension in bilingual children. Three-year-old English-Mandarin bilingual children (N = 28) heard familiar words in both English and Mandarin spoken through transparent face shields, surgical masks, and without masks. When tested in English, children recognized words presented without a mask and through a surgical mask, but did not recognize words presented with transparent face shields, replicating past findings with monolingual children. In contrast, when tested in Mandarin, children recognized words presented without a mask, through a surgical mask, and through a transparent face shield. Results are discussed in terms of specific properties of English and Mandarin that may elicit different effects for transparent face shields. Overall, the present findings suggest that face coverings, and in particular, surgical masks do not disrupt spoken word recognition in young bilingual children.

J	Biro, S				Biro, Szilvia			Twelve months old infants' evaluation of observed comforting behavior using a choice paradigm: The role of animacy cues and self-distress	INFANCY												Comforting is a prosocial behavior that children start to engage in around their second year of life. There is much less known about their ability to evaluate comforting behavior of others. The current study examined whether 12 months old infants, after having watched animated abstract characters comfort or ignore a third party in distress, would show a preference for the comforting character. Using a manual choice paradigm, we found that infants were more likely to choose the comforting character than the ignoring character (Experiment 1). When the characters however lacked human surface features (eyes) infants did not show a preference (Experiment 2). Furthermore, infants self-distress during the watching of the animations did not prevent infants to evaluate the behavior of the observed characters. These findings support the idea of an early presence of "moral sense" in infancy.

Infant externalizing behavior and parent depressive symptoms: Prospective predictors of parental pandemic related distress	INFANCY												Understanding predictors and effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic is a top-priority in research endeavors. The impact of COVID-19 on all components of family life and mental health cannot be overstated. This study emphasizes the need to investigate predictors of parents' responses to disaster by conceptualizing the depth of the impact of the pandemic using Bronfenbrenner's Bioecological Systems Model. We evaluate parents of infants as the center of the microsystem and discuss the importance of parents' responses to the pandemic for children's development. Specifically, utilizing a prospective design involving a sample of 105 infant-mother-father triads, we test the predictive effects of mothers' and fathers' mental health and infant externalizing behavior assessed prior to the pandemic when infants were 16-months on later pandemic related distress (PRD) approximately 1 year later. Results indicate that for both mothers and fathers, more depressive symptoms during their child's infancy predicted more PRD. Although mothers' reports of more child externalizing behavior significantly predicted more PRD, fathers' reports of externalizing were strongly, positively correlated with their concurrent depressive symptoms but not directly related to PRD. We demonstrate the importance of pre-existing mental health and parents' perceptions of their children's behavior as early as 16 months, in coping with disaster.

J	Tamis-LeMonda, CS				Tamis-LeMonda, Catherine S.			The mountain stream of infant development	INFANCY												Development is complex. It encompasses interacting domains, at multiple levels, across nested time scales. Embracing the complexity of development-while addressing the challenges inherent to studying infants-requires researchers to make tough decisions about what to study, why, how, where, and when. My own view is inspired by a developmental systems approach, and echoed in Esther Thelen's (2005) mountain stream metaphor. Like a river that carves its course, the active infant navigates the social and physical environment and generates rich inputs that propel learning and development. Drawing from my experiences, I offer some recommendations to guide research on infants. I encourage researchers to embrace discovery science; to observe infants in ecologically valid settings; to recognize the active and adaptive nature of infant behavior; to break down silos and consider the nonobvious; and to adopt full transparency in all aspects of research. I draw on cascading influences in infant play, language, and motor domains to illustrate the value of a bottom-up, cross-domain, collaborative approach.

J	Oakes, LM				Oakes, Lisa M.			Understanding developmental cascades and experience: Diversity matters	INFANCY												This Presidential Address is aimed at considering how infant development can be understood in terms of developmental cascades. Adopting a developmental cascades approach may be especially useful for understanding development in infancy, when changes occur in multiple domains over relatively short time spans. Thinking about change in terms of developmental cascades highlights the role of the input in development, both in terms of how the input changes with development and in terms of how differences in the input lead to different developmental pathways. I reflect on how a developmental cascade perspective can help us understand the role of input and how development builds as the emergence and refinement of abilities changes the input and shapes the developmental pathways. Further, I emphasize that infants develop despite differences in the input, and that when studying infant development we should seriously consider the diversity of experience that infants encounter and how differences in experience (and input) shape the developmental cascade.

However, few studies to date have tested whether early brain measures are indicative of the developmental trajectory of language, as opposed to language outcomes at specific ages. We combined recordings from two longitudinal studies, including typically developing infants without a family history of autism, and infants with increased likelihood of developing autism (infant-siblings) (N = 191). Electroencephalograms (EEG) were recorded at 6 months, and behavioral assessments at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months of age. Using a growth curve model, we tested whether absolute EEG spectral power at 6 months was associated with concurrent language abilities, and developmental change in language between 6 and 36 months. We found evidence of an association between 6-month alpha-band power and concurrent, but not developmental change in, expressive language ability in both infant-siblings and control infants. The observed association between 6-month alpha-band power and 6-month expressive language was not moderated by group status, suggesting some continuity in neural mechanisms.

Late talkers show delays in expressive phonological development, but less is known about their receptive phonological development. In the current study, U.S. monolingual English-speaking typical talkers (TTs) (n = 23, mean age = 26.27 months, 57% male; 78.3% White) and late talkers (n = 22, mean age = 24.57 months, 59% male, 72.7% White) completed a Looking-While-Listening task to assess their sensitivity to mispronunciations. Results revealed that late talkers and TTs looked to the referent of a word for a shorter duration when it was mispronounced than when it was correctly pronounced, suggesting they were sensitive to mispronunciations. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in their sensitivity to mispronunciations.

Barcoding, linear and nonlinear analysis of full-day leg movements in infants with typical development and infants at risk of developmental disabilities: Cross-sectional study	INFANCY												Traditional methods do not capture the multidimensional domains and dynamic nature of infant behavioral patterns. We aim to compare full-day, in-home leg movement data between infants with typical development (TD) and infants at risk of developmental disabilities (AR) using barcoding and nonlinear analysis. Eleven infants with TD (2-10 months) and nine infants AR (adjusted age: 2-14 months) wore a sensor on each ankle for 7 days. We calculated the standard deviation for linear variability and sample entropy (SampEn) of leg acceleration and angular velocity for nonlinear variability. Movements were also categorized into 16 barcoding states, and we calculated the SampEn and proportions of the barcoding. All variables were compared between the two groups using independent-samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. The AR group had larger linear variability compared to the TD group. SampEn was lower in the AR group compared to TD group for both acceleration and angular velocity. Two barcoding states' proportions were significantly different between the two groups. The results showed that nonlinear analysis and barcoding could be used to identify the difference of dynamic multidimensional movement patterns between infants AR and infants with TD. This information may help early diagnosis of developmental disabilities in the future.

Seven-months-old infants show increased arousal to static emotion body expressions: Evidence from pupil dilation	INFANCY												Human body postures provide perceptual cues that can be used to discriminate and recognize emotions. It was previously found that 7-months-olds' fixation patterns discriminated fear from other emotion body expressions but it is not clear whether they also process the emotional content of those expressions. The emotional content of visual stimuli can increase arousal level resulting in pupil dilations. To provide evidence that infants also process the emotional content of expressions, we analyzed variations in pupil in response to emotion stimuli. Forty-eight 7-months-old infants viewed adult body postures expressing anger, fear, happiness and neutral expressions, while their pupil size was measured. There was a significant emotion effect between 1040 and 1640 ms after image onset, when fear elicited larger pupil dilations than neutral expressions. A similar trend was found for anger expressions. Our results suggest that infants have increased arousal to negative-valence body expressions. Thus, in combination with previous fixation results, the pupil data show that infants as young as 7-months can perceptually discriminate static body expressions and process the emotional content of those expressions. The results extend information about infant processing of emotion expressions conveyed through other means (e.g., faces).

J	Reuter, T; Mazzei, C; Lew-Williams, C; Emberson, L				Reuter, Tracy; Mazzei, Carolyn; Lew-Williams, Casey; Emberson, Lauren			Infants' lexical comprehension and lexical anticipation abilities are closely linked in early language development	INFANCY												Theories across cognitive domains propose that anticipating upcoming sensory input supports information processing. In line with this view, prior findings indicate that adults and children anticipate upcoming words during real-time language processing, via such processes as prediction and priming. However, it is unclear if anticipatory processes are strictly an outcome of prior language development or are more entwined with language learning and development. We operationalized this theoretical question as whether developmental emergence of comprehension of lexical items occurs before or concurrently with the anticipation of these lexical items. To this end, we tested infants of ages 12, 15, 18, and 24 months (N = 67) on their abilities to comprehend and anticipate familiar nouns. In an eye-tracking task, infants viewed pairs of images and heard sentences with either informative words (e.g., eat) that allowed them to anticipate an upcoming noun (e.g., cookie), or uninformative words (e.g., see). Findings indicated that infants' comprehension and anticipation abilities are closely linked over developmental time and within individuals. Importantly, we do not find evidence for lexical comprehension in the absence of lexical anticipation. Thus, anticipatory processes are present early in infants' second year, suggesting they are a part of language development rather than solely an outcome of it.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAY	2023	28	3					532	549		10.1111/infa.12534	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12534		FEB 2023						36808682					WOS:000935001700001

We examined changes in caregivers' use of touches with their speech directed to infants using a multimodal cross-sectional corpus of 35 Korean mother-child dyads across three age groups of infants (8, 14, and 27 months). We tested the hypothesis that caregivers' frequency and use of touches with speech change with infants' development. Results revealed that the frequency of word/utterance-touch alignment as well as word + touch co-occurrence is highest in speech addressed to the youngest group of infants. Thus, this study provides support for the hypothesis that caregivers' use of touch during dyadic interactions is sensitive to infants' age in a way similar to caregivers' use of speech alone and could provide cues useful to infants' language learning at critical points in early development.

Intersensory processing of faces and voices at 6 months predicts language outcomes at 18, 24, and 36 months of age	INFANCY												Intersensory processing of social events (e.g., matching sights and sounds of audiovisual speech) is a critical foundation for language development. Two recently developed protocols, the Multisensory Attention Assessment Protocol (MAAP) and the Intersensory Processing Efficiency Protocol (IPEP), assess individual differences in intersensory processing at a sufficiently fine-grained level for predicting developmental outcomes. Recent research using the MAAP demonstrates 12-month intersensory processing of face-voice synchrony predicts language outcomes at 18- and 24-months, holding traditional predictors (parent language input, SES) constant. Here, we build on these findings testing younger infants using the IPEP, a more comprehensive, fine-grained index of intersensory processing. Using a longitudinal sample of 103 infants, we tested whether intersensory processing (speed, accuracy) of faces and voices at 3- and 6-months predicts language outcomes at 12-, 18-, 24-, and 36-months, holding traditional predictors constant. Results demonstrate intersensory processing of faces and voices at 6-months (but not 3-months) accounted for significant unique variance in language outcomes at 18-, 24-, and 36-months, beyond that of traditional predictors. Findings highlight the importance of intersensory processing of face-voice synchrony as a foundation for language development as early as 6-months and reveal that individual differences assessed by the IPEP predict language outcomes even 2.5-years later.

In this pre-registered meta-analysis, we reviewed 182 publications in infant (0-24 months) functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) research published from 1998 to April 9, 2020, and investigated the trends and predictors of attrition. The average attrition rate was 34.23% among 272 experiments across all 182 publications. Among a subset of 136 experiments that reported the specific reasons for subject exclusion, 21.50% of the attrition was infant-driven, while 14.21% was signal-driven. Subject characteristics (e.g., age) and study design (e.g., fNIRS cap configuration, block/trial design, and stimulus type) predicted the total and subject-driven attrition rates, suggesting that modifying the recruitment pool or the study design can meaningfully reduce the attrition rate in infant fNIRS research. Based on the findings, we established guidelines for reporting the attrition rate for scientific transparency and made recommendations to minimize the attrition rates. This research can facilitate developmental cognitive neuroscientists in their quest toward increasingly rigorous and representative research.

J	Issard, C; Tsuji, S; Cristia, A				Issard, Cecile; Tsuji, Sho; Cristia, Alejandrina			Infants' preference for speech is stable across the first year of life: Meta-analytic evidence	INFANCY												Previous work suggested that humans' sophisticated speech perception abilities stem from an early capacity to pay attention to speech in the auditory environment. What are the roots of this early preference? We assess the extent to which it is due to it being a vocal sound, a natural sound, and a familiar sound through a meta-analytic approach, classifying experiments as a function of whether they used native or foreign speech and whether the competitor, against which preference is tested, was vocal or non-vocal, natural or artificial. We also tested for the effect of age. Synthesizing data from 791 infants across 39 experiments, we found a medium effect size, confirming at the scale of the literature that infants reliably prefer speech over other sounds. This preference was not significantly moderated by the language used, vocal quality, or naturalness of the competitor, nor by infant age. The current body of evidence appears most compatible with the hypothesis that speech is preferred consistently as such and not just due to its vocal, natural, or familiar nature. We discuss limitations of the extant body of work on speech preference, including evidence consistent with a publication bias and low representation of certain stimuli types and ages.

For this purpose, we recruited 23 infants at 11 and 13 months of age yielded 246 giving gesture bouts that were performed in three contexts: typical when the object was offered immediately, contingent on exploration, and contingent on play. The analysis revealed that maternal responses to infants' giving gestures varied and were affected by their age and gesture context. Hence, mothers amended their responses according to the background that generated each gesture. The number of verbal responses to infants' giving gestures decreased as the infants aged, whereas the number of pretense responses increased. For infants aged 11 months, mothers generally provided motor responses to typical gestures. However, for infants aged 13 months, this trend declined and was replaced by a strong positive correlation between giving gestures contingent on play and verbal responses. We concluded that the type of activity with objects prior to employing giving gestures could enhance infants' symbolic skills because caregivers monitor the contingent act that yields the gesture that shapes their response.

J	Tummeltshammer, K; Amso, D				Tummeltshammer, Kristen; Amso, Dima			Infants use contextual memory to attend and learn in naturalistic scenes	INFANCY												Infants encounter new objects and learn about object features in relation to a rich and detailed visuospatial context. Using a contextual cueing task, recent work showed that 6- and 10- month-old infants search more efficiently for target objects in repeated rather than novel visuospatial contexts (i.e., arrays of shapes on a blank background). Here, we investigate whether infants' sensitivity to visuospatial context scales up to more complex and potentially more distracting, naturalistic scenes. In an eye-tracking task, 8-month-olds searched for a novel target object in colorful photographs of everyday environments (e.g., bedrooms and kitchens). Repeated ( "Old ") contexts co-varied with target locations, such that the target object appeared in exactly the same location on the same scene, while varying ( "New ") contexts contained target objects placed in different counterbalanced locations across a variety of scenes. Infants exhibited faster search times, more anticipation of target animation, and longer looking at targets that appeared in Old relative to New contexts. In a subsequent memory test, infants showed better recognition of label-object pairings for target objects that had appeared in Old, rather than New, contexts. These results indicate that infants can use visuospatial contextual information in complex naturalistic scenes to facilitate memory-guided attention and learning of object-paired labels.

Online reach correction in 6-and 11-month-old infants	INFANCY												The current study investigated the development of online reach control. Six- and 11-month-old infants reached for a toy while their hand position was tracked. The toy either remained stationary (baseline trials) or unexpectedly displaced left- or rightward during the reach (perturbation trials). To obtain a measure of online reach correction, we compared reaches in the perturbation trials to reaches in baseline trials using autoregression analysis. Infants of both age groups adjusted their reach trajectories in the direction of the displacement. Moreover, we divided the reaching movements into movement units, defined as the submovements of a reach between local minima in hand speed. Eleven-month-old infants adjusted their reach within the span of a single movement unit; corrections in 6-month-olds spanned multiple movement units. These results suggest that the reach control system has a rudimentary replanning capacity by 6 months of age, which, with age, further develops to a more sophisticated online control mechanism for ongoing reaches.

J	Alessandroni, N				Alessandroni, Nicolas			The road to conventional tool use: Developmental changes in children's material engagement with artifacts in nursery school	INFANCY												The development of tool use in early childhood is a topic of continuing interest in developmental psychology. However, the lack of studies in ecological settings results in many unknowns about how children come to use artifacts according to their cultural function. We report a longitudinal study with 17 sociodemographically diverse children (8 female) attending a nursery school in Madrid (Spain) and their two adult female teachers. Using mixed-effects models and Granger causality analysis, we measured changes in the frequency and duration of children's object uses between 7 and 17 months of age and in the directional influences among pairs of behaviors performed by teachers and children. Results show a clear shift in how children use artifacts. As early as 12 months of age, the frequency of conventional uses outweighs that of all other types of object use. In addition, object uses become shorter in duration with age, irrespective of their type. Moreover, certain teachers' nonlinguistic communicative strategies (e.g., demonstrations of canonical use and placing gestures) significantly influence and promote children's conventional tool use. Findings shed light on how children become increasingly proficient in conventional tool use through interactions with artifacts and others in nursery school.

J	Toyama, N				Toyama, Noriko			Locomotion development and infants' object interaction in a day-care environment	INFANCY												This longitudinal study examined the relationship between the development of locomotion and infants' interaction with others involving objects. Observations took place in a multi-person situation-a day-care class-for one-year-old infants for 1 year. The study participants were 13 infants and 7 caregivers (all Japanese). Frequencies of infants' manual contact with objects and moving before contact with them did not differ according to locomotion developmental level. However, infants who began walking engaged in more social interactions than those who were cruising or crawling. Throughout all locomotor developmental periods, social interactions increased in frequency when more caregivers were present. As infants began to walk, they moved more prior to social interactions, had more frequent bidirectional and triadic social interactions, and moved and interacted more often with others during a single object episode. These results suggest that crawlers' engagement with objects is relatively object-oriented, while for walkers, locomotion seems to be driven by social stimuli. Infants who have begun to walk moved among caregivers and peers in a multi-person environment and developed more elaborated social interactions through objects.

J	Antovich, DM; Estes, KG				Antovich, Dylan M. M.; Estes, Katharine Graf			Statistical word segmentation: Anchoring learning across contexts	INFANCY												The present experiments were designed to assess infants' abilities to use syllable co-occurrence regularities to segment fluent speech across contexts. Specifically, we investigated whether 9-month-old infants could use statistical regularities in one speech context to support speech segmentation in a second context. Contexts were defined by different word sets representing contextual differences that might occur across conversations or utterances. This mimics the integration of information across multiple interactions within a single language, which is critical for language acquisition. In particular, we performed two experiments to assess whether a statistically segmented word could be used to anchor segmentation in a second, more challenging context, namely speech with variable word lengths. The results of Experiment 1 were consistent with past work suggesting that statistical learning may be hindered by speech with word-length variability, which is inherent to infants' natural speech environments. In Experiment 2, we found that infants could use a previously statistically segmented word to support word segmentation in a novel, challenging context. We also present findings suggesting that this ability was associated with infants' early word knowledge but not their performance on a cognitive development assessment.

The impact of face masks on infants' learning of faces: An eye tracking study	INFANCY												This preregistered study examined how face masks influenced face memory in a North American sample of 6- to 9-month-old infants (N = 58) born during the COVID-19 pandemic. Infants' memory was tested using a standard visual paired comparison (VPC) task. We crossed whether or not the faces were masked during familiarization and test, yielding four trial types (masked-familiarization/masked-test, unmasked-familiarization/masked-test, masked-familiarization/unmasked-test, and unmasked-familiarization/unmasked-test). Infants showed memory for the faces if the faces were unmasked at test, regardless of whether or not the face was masked during familiarization. However, infants did not show robust evidence of memory when test faces were masked, regardless of the familiarization condition. In addition, infants' bias for looking at the upper (eye) region was greater for masked than unmasked faces, although this difference was unrelated to memory performance. In summary, although the presence of face masks does appear to influence infants' processing of and memory for faces, they can form memories of masked faces and recognize those familiar faces even when unmasked.

Since faces are the gateway to early social cognition, this raised major concerns about the effect face masks may have on infants' attention to faces as well as on their language and social development. The goal of the present study was to assess how face masks modulate infants' attention to faces over the course of the first year of life. We measured 3, 6, 9, and 12-month-olds' looking behavior using a paired visual preference paradigm under two experimental conditions. First, we tested infants' preference for upright masked or unmasked faces of the same female individual. We found that regardless of age, infants looked equally long at the masked and unmasked faces. Second, we compared infants' attention to an upright masked versus an inverted masked face. Three- and 6-month-olds looked equally long to the masked faces when they were upright or inverted. However, 9- and 12-month-old infants showed a novelty preference for the inverted masked face. Our findings suggest that more experience with faces, including masked faces, leads to efficient adaptations of infants' visual system for processing impoverished social stimuli, such as partially occluded faces.

J	Albert, RR; Ernst, M; Vallotton, CD				Albert, Rachel R.; Ernst, Morgan; Vallotton, Claire D.			Infant vocalizations elicit simplified speech in childcare	INFANCY												Infant babbling has an important social function in promoting early language development by attracting caregiver attention and prompting parents' contingent, simplified speech, which is more learnable for infants. Here, we demonstrate that prelinguistic infant vocalizations also create learning opportunities for infants in childcare settings by eliciting simplified and more learnable linguistic information during teacher-infant interactions. We compared the rates and complexity of contingent and non-contingent verbal interactions of 34 childcare teachers during a one-on-one free play interaction with a familiar infant under their care (M = 12.6 months old). As compared to non-contingent utterances, teachers' contingent utterances included fewer unique words, a higher proportion of single-word responses, and a shorter mean length of utterances. Teachers did not change their response length based on infants' syllable type and were equally likely to respond to vowels and consonant-vowel vocalizations. Sources of individual differences in the simplification effect related to infant behaviors and teacher characteristics are discussed. The results parallel previous findings demonstrating the simplification effect in parent-infant interactions. That teachers also show this simplification effect when responding to infant vocalizations suggests the power of infant prelinguistic vocalizations for organizing caregiver attention in various settings to elicit simplified, learnable language.

The current study examined continuity, stability, and bidirectional associations in maternal and infant dyadic Emotional Availability (EA) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were 110 Israeli mother-infant dyads (51% girls) that were assessed prior to (Mage = 3.5 months) and during (Mage = 12.4 months) the pandemic. At both time points, mother-infant interactions were observed during play (nonstressful context) and tasks designed to elicit infant frustration (stressful context). Maternal and child EA were coded offline. Maternal EA demonstrated no significant mean-level changes from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas infant responsiveness and involvement increased over time. Stability and bidirectional associations in EA differed by context and were evident only in the stressful context. Mothers' perceived levels of social support further moderated these associations. Specifically, infants' pre-pandemic responsiveness and involvement predicted maternal EA during the pandemic only when mothers reported low levels of social support. Our findings suggest that maternal and child EA were not adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, patterns of EA demonstrated moderate-to-no stability over time, suggesting considerable individual differences in trajectories of EA.

Infant motor development predicts the dynamics of movement during sleep	INFANCY												The characteristics of infant sleep change over the first year. Generally, infants wake and move less at night as they grow older. However, acquisition of new motor skills leads to temporary increases in night waking and movement at night. Indeed, sleep-dependent movement at night is important for sensorimotor development. Nevertheless, little is known about how movement during sleep changes as infants accrue locomotor experience. The current study investigated whether infant sleep and movement during sleep were predicted by infants' walking experience. Seventy-eight infants wore an actigraph to measure physical activity during sleep. Parents reported when their infants first walked across a room >10 feet without stopping or falling. Infants in the midst of walking skill acquisition had worse sleep than an age-group estimate. Infants with more walk experience had more temporally sporadic movement during sleep and a steeper hourly increase in physical activity over the course of the night. Ongoing motor skill consolidation changes the characteristics of movement during sleep and may alter sleep state-dependent memory consolidation. We propose a model whereby changes in gross motor activity during night sleep reflect movement-dependent consolidation.

Responding to joint attention as a developmental catalyst: Longitudinal associations with language and social responsiveness	INFANCY												Joint attention (JA), infants' ability to engage in triadic attention with another person and a separate object or event, emerges in infancy. Responding to joint attention (RJA) develops earlier than initiating joint attention (IJA) and may benefit from a reconceptualization from a competence to a skill that varies in performance. Investigating associations between RJA performance and important skills of toddlerhood such as language, social responsiveness, and executive function (EF) in typically developing samples can better elucidate how RJA may serve as a developmental precursor to later dimensional skills, with implications for both typical and atypical development. Here, 210 (82% White) infants completed the Dimensional Joint Attention Assessment (DJAA), a naturalistic play-based assessment of RJA, at 8-15 months. At 16-38 months social responsiveness, verbal ability, and EF were assessed. Multilevel models showed that DJAA scores were associated with later verbal abilities and parent-reported social responsiveness. Exploratory analyses showed trend-level associations between RJA and EF. Results establish the content validity of the DJAA as a measure of RJA, and longitudinal associations with later verbal ability and social responsiveness. Future work should examine EF emergence and consolidation, and RJA and later EF associations.

Persistent, clinically relevant difficulties in self-regulation include excessive crying or sleeping disorders. Many families with affected children are burdened with multiple psychosocial risk. This suggests that regulatory problems are best conceptualized as the maladaptive interplay of overly burdened parents and a dysfunctional parent-child interaction. The current study examines whether social isolation and bonding difficulties function as mediating mechanisms linking maternal psychopathology to (1) children's excessive crying and (2) sleeping problems. The sample comprised N = 6598 mothers (M = 31.51 years) of children between zero to three years of age (M = 14.08 months, 50.1% girls). In addition to socio demographic data, the written questionnaire included information on maternal depression/anxiety, isolation, bonding, and children's regulatory problems. Hypotheses were tested with a mediation model controlling for psychosocial risk and child characteristics. As expected, maternal symptoms of depression/anxiety were linked to infants' excessive crying and sleeping problems. Social isolation and bonding difficulties mediated this association for excessive crying as well as for sleeping problems, but social isolation was a single mediator for sleeping problems only. The findings provide important insights in the mediating pathways linking maternal psychopathology to children's regulatory problems.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAR	2023	28	2					435	453		10.1111/infa.12514	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12514		NOV 2022						36397657					WOS:000888916200001
J	Wang, J; Feigenson, L				Wang, Jinjing (Jenny); Feigenson, Lisa			What aspects of counting help infants attend to numerosity?	INFANCY												Recent work shows that 18-month old infants understand that counting is numerically relevant-infants who see objects counted are more likely to represent the approximate number of objects in the array than infants who see the objects labeled but not counted. Which aspects of counting signal infants to attend to numerosity in this way? Here we asked whether infants rely on familiarity with the count words in their native language, or on procedures instantiated by the counting routine, independent of specific tokens. In three experiments (N = 48), we found that 18-month old infants from English-speaking households successfully distinguished four hidden objects from two when the objects were counted correctly, regardless of their familiarity with the count words (i.e., when objects were counted in familiar English and in unfamiliar German). However, when the objects were counted using familiar English count words in ways that violated basic counting principles, infants no longer represented the arrays, failing to distinguish four hidden objects from two. Together with previous findings, these results suggest that children may link the procedure of counting with numerosity years before they learn the meanings of the count words.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAR	2023	28	2					218	239		10.1111/infa.12512	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12512		NOV 2022						36382568					WOS:000884261200001

Factor structure of the Mini-Maternal Behavior Q-Sort and associations with infant attachment: Informing precision in research and intervention	INFANCY												We examined the factor structure of parental sensitivity to infants as assessed by the Mini-Maternal Behavior Q-Sort (Mini-MBQS), a 25-item short-form of the original 90-item MBQS. We aimed to: (1) identify latent factors of the Mini-MBQS; and (2) validate each factor by testing associations with infant attachment classifications. Data on parent-infant dyads (n = 313; 222 mothers with 281 children, 29 fathers with 32 children) were drawn from a three-generation Australian cohort study. Exploratory Factor Analysis and Exploratory Structural Equation Modelling examined the structure of the Mini-MBQS. Two latent Mini-MBQS factors were identified, requiring 8 of 25 original items: (1) Attention and Responsiveness and (2) Contingency in Interactions. Infants with insecure attachment classifications had parents with lower sensitivity across both factors relative to infants classified secure. In particular, infants with resistant attachment classifications had parents with notably low Contingency in Interactions scores. Infants with disorganised attachment classifications had parents with the lowest relative sensitivity across both factors, and in these dyads Attention and Responsiveness scores were especially low. Results provide an empirically derived factor structure for the Mini-MBQS. Two subscales, each with significant infant attachment associations, may improve precision in clinical intervention and research translation.

The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on infant development and maternal mental health in the first 2 years of life	INFANCY												We investigated how exogenous variation in exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic during the first year of life is related to infant development, maternal mental health, and perceived stress. Ninety-three socioeconomically diverse pregnant women were recruited before the pandemic to participate in a longitudinal study. Infants ranged in age at the beginning of lockdown (0-9.5 months old), thus experiencing different durations of pandemic exposure across the first year of life. The duration of pandemic exposure was not associated with family demographic characteristics, suggesting it captured exogenous variability. We tested associations between this exogenous variation in pandemic exposure and child and family outcomes. We also examined whether mother-reported disruptive life events were correlated with child and family outcomes. We found no association between duration of pandemic exposure in the first year of life and infant socioemotional problems, infant language development, or maternal mental health and perceived stress symptoms, at 12 or 24 months. However, we found that self-reported exposure to pandemic-related disruptive life events predicted greater maternal depression, anxiety, and perceived stress at 12 months, and greater depression and anxiety at 24 months. Socioeconomic status did not moderate these associations. These findings suggest cautious optimism for infants raised during this period.

J	Babineau, M; Emond, E; Shi, RS				Babineau, Mireille; Emond, Emeryse; Shi, Rushen			When language-general and language-specific processes are in conflict: The case of sub-syllabic word segmentation in toddlers	INFANCY												Infants use statistics-based word segmentation strategies from the preverbal stage. Statistical segmentation is, however, constrained by the Onset Bias, a language-universal principle that disfavors segmentation that harms syllable integrity. Children eventually learn language-specific exceptions to this principle. For instance, sub-syllabic parsing occurs for vowel-initial words in French liaison contexts, that is, when a word's final consonant surfaces as the following word's syllabic onset (e.g., /n/ in un /n/elephant). In past research, French-learning 24-month-olds succeeded in parsing a vowel-initial pseudo-word surfacing with variable liaison consonants. This study further investigated infants' liaison representation, its potential impacts on parsing, and its interaction with the Onset Bias. In Experiments 1 and 2, French-learning 24-month-olds were familiarized with pseudo-words with variable liaison-like versus nonliaison-like onset consonants, preceded by words that cannot trigger those onsets (e.g., un zonche; un gonche). We found no mis-segmentation as vowel-initial and successful segmentation as consonant-initial. In Experiment 3, when the preceding words could trigger a liaison consonant that matched the onset of the following word (e.g., un nonche), infants showed a vowel-initial mis-interpretation, against the Onset Bias, revealing an effect of liaison knowledge. These results demonstrate that toddlers balance their use of language-general principles/strategies and language-specific knowledge during early acquisition.

J	Tan, SHJ; Kalashnikova, M; Burnham, D				Tan, Sok Hui Jessica; Kalashnikova, Marina; Burnham, Denis			Seeing a talking face matters: Infants' segmentation of continuous auditory-visual speech	INFANCY												Visual speech cues from a speaker's talking face aid speech segmentation in adults, but despite the importance of speech segmentation in language acquisition, little is known about the possible influence of visual speech on infants' speech segmentation. Here, to investigate whether there is facilitation of speech segmentation by visual information, two groups of English-learning 7-month-old infants were presented with continuous speech passages, one group with auditory-only (AO) speech and the other with auditory-visual (AV) speech. Additionally, the possible relation between infants' relative attention to the speaker's mouth versus eye regions and their segmentation performance was examined. Both the AO and the AV groups of infants successfully segmented words from the continuous speech stream, but segmentation performance persisted for longer for infants in the AV group. Interestingly, while AV group infants showed no significant relation between the relative amount of time spent fixating the speaker's mouth versus eyes and word segmentation, their attention to the mouth was greater than that of AO group infants, especially early in test trials. The results are discussed in relation to the possible pathways through which visual speech cues aid speech perception.					tan, Jessica/AEX-7236-2022; Kalashnikova, Marina/B-6590-2019; Burnham, Denis/L-3742-2019	Burnham, Denis/0000-0002-1980-3458													1525-0008	1532-7078				MAR	2023	28	2					277	300		10.1111/infa.12509	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12509		OCT 2022						36217702					WOS:000865647900001

Infant locomotion shapes proximity to adults during everyday play in the US	INFANCY												Learning to walk expands infants' access to the physical environment and prompts changes in their communicative behaviors. However, little is known about whether walking also shapes infants' proximity to their adult social partners during everyday activities at home. Here we followed 89 infants (42 boys, 47 girls; 92% White, not Hispanic or Latino) longitudinally and documented connections between infant locomotion and infant-adult proximity on two timescales: (1) across developmental time, by comparing data from a session when infants could only crawl to a later session when they could walk (M walk onset = 12.15 months, range = 8-15); and (2) in real time, by testing whether the amount of time that infants spent in motion (regardless of their locomotor status) related to their interpersonal distance to adults. The developmental transition to walking corresponded to a significant, but modest, decrease in infant-adult proximity. Infants' moment-to-moment locomotion, however, was strongly related to patterns of interpersonal distance: infants who spent more time in motion spent less time near adults and instigated more proximity transitions, resulting in shorter and more dispersed bouts of proximity throughout sessions. Findings shed new light on how infants' motor achievements can reverberate across other domains of development, and how changes in infant development that researchers often observe over months arise from infants' moment-to-moment experiences.

Our knowledge of the relations between early negative affectivity and preverbal and verbal communicative development is still limited. Further, observed and reported temperament capture how aspects of temperament operate in different settings but are rarely used in parallel in studies examining early language. During the period of rapid development, longitudinal studies are needed to identify early risk factors for delayed communicative development. We studied relations between aspects of emerging self-regulation and negative affectivity using both observations at 8 months and mother-reports at 6 and 12 months, and communicative development measured by gesturing and vocabulary at 14 and vocabulary at 30 months in 183 children. Mother-reported self-regulation was related to a higher use of communicative gestures and observed self-regulation by gaze aversion to poorer receptive and expressive vocabulary at 14 months, but neither was significantly associated with vocabulary at 30 months. We found little evidence for associations between negative affectivity and fear in infancy and communicative development. Our findings highlight different aspects of self-regulation as both potential risk and protective factors for communicative development. Mixed results indicate a need for a more detailed examination of different strategies of self-regulation in different conditions and developmental stages to yield a deeper understanding of the relations between self-regulation in infancy and communicative development.

J	Decarli, G; Piazza, M; Izard, V				Decarli, Gisella; Piazza, Manuela; Izard, Veronique			Are infants' preferences in the number change detection paradigm driven by sequence patterns?	INFANCY												Inter-individual differences in infants' numerosity processing have been assessed using a change detection paradigm, where participants were presented with two concurrent streams of images, one alternating between two numerosities and the other showing one constant numerosity. While most infants look longer at the changing stream in this paradigm, the reasons underlying these preferences have remained unclear. We suggest that, besides being attracted by numerosity changes, infants perhaps also respond to the alternating pattern of the changing stream. We conducted two experiments (N = 32) with 6-month-old infants to assess this hypothesis. In the first experiment, infants responded to changes in numerosity even when the changing stream showed numerosities in an unpredictable random order. In the second experiment, infants did not display any preference when an alternating stream was pitted against a random stream. These findings do not provide evidence that the alternating pattern of the changing stream contributes to drive infants' preferences. Instead, around the age of 6 months, infants' responses in the numerosity change detection paradigm appear to be mainly driven by changes in numerosity, with different levels of preference reflecting inter-individual difference in the acuity of numerosity perception.

J	Neff, MB; Martin, A				Neff, Mary Beth; Martin, Alia			Do face-to-face interactions support 6-month-olds' understanding of the communicative function of speech?	INFANCY												Infants by 6 months recognize that speech communicates information between third parties. We investigated whether 6-month-olds always expect speech to communicate or whether they also consider social features of communication, like how interlocutors engage with one another. A small sample of infants watched an actor (the Speaker) choose one of two objects to play with (the target). When the Speaker could no longer reach her target object, she turned to a new actor (the Listener) and said a nonsense word. During speech, the actors were either face-to-face, the Speaker was facing away from the Listener, or the reverse. When the actors had been face-to-face, infants looked longer when the Listener selected the non-target object compared to the target. Infants looked equally regardless of what the Listener chose when either actor had been disengaged. Area-of-interest gaze coding suggests that infants were similarly interested in the interaction across conditions, but their pattern of attention to Speaker and Listener differed when the Listener was disengaged during speech. Although these experiments should be replicated with a larger sample, the findings provide initial evidence that 6-month-olds do not expect speech alone to communicate, but also attend to the social context in which speech is produced.

J	Sen, U; Gredebäck, G				Sen, Umay; Gredeback, Gustaf			Learning limb-specific contingencies in early infancy	INFANCY												Most research with the mobile paradigm has the underlying assumption that young infants can selectively move the limb causing the contingent feedback from the mobile while avoiding irrelevant motor responses. Contrary to this long-held belief, others have argued that such differentiation ability is not fully developed early in life. In the current study, we revisited the traditional mobile paradigm with a contemporary research approach (using high-precision motion capture techniques, a yoked-control design, and a large sample size) to investigate whether response differentiation ability emerges before 5 months of age. The data collected from 76 infants (aged between 115 and 159 days) revealed that infants can learn sensorimotor contingencies by increasing the movement of the connected leg relative to their baseline level. However, they did not differentially increase the movement of the leg causing an effect in the environment compared with that of other limbs. Our results illustrate that response differentiation ability emerges later than previously suggested.

Holistic face processing in 4-and 7-month-old infants	INFANCY												Previous studies found an onset of holistic face processing in the age range between 0-4 and 7 months of age. To validate these studies, the present study investigated infants 4 and 7 months of age with a different experimental approach. In a habituation-dishabituation experiment, the infants were tested with stereoscopic stimuli in which stripes floated above a face, thereby occluding some parts of the face (amodal completion condition), and stereoscopic stimuli in which the same face parts floated above stripes (modal completion condition). Research with adults indicates that faces are processed holistically, that is as global wholes, in the amodal, but as independent parts in the modal completion condition, resulting in superior face recognition when the occluding bars are in front of than when they are behind the visible face parts. The present study found that infants regardless of whether they are 4 or 7 months old reliably recognized and differentiated the faces in the amodal but not in the modal completion condition. Moreover, the difference between the experimental conditions was statistically significant. These findings show that approximately at the age of 4-7 months of life, infants begin to holistically unify disjoint face parts into a coherent whole.

We hypothesized that there would be a decrease in vagal tone in triadic interactions compared with dyadic interactions, as triadic interactions are more complex and therefore more resource demanding. However, we expected this difference to be smaller for infants who experienced the period of confinement, as the lockdown led parents to spend more time at home. We also hypothesized that parents would have less stressful interactional events in the triadic interaction because they would be used to interacting with the child together. This study included 36 parents with their 3 month-old infants. Eighteen families met the study authors before the onset of the pandemic (pre-COVID) and 18 met them after its onset, having experienced a period of confinement during the infants' first 3 months of life (COVID). Results showed that the COVID group had no decrease in vagal tone during triadic interactions, whereas the pre-COVID group did. This difference could not, however, be explained by less stressful interactional events in triadic interactions, as the COVID group showed more stressful interactional events in mother-father-infant interactions.

J	Schroer, SE; Yu, C				Schroer, Sara E.; Yu, Chen			The real-time effects of parent speech on infants' multimodal attention and dyadic coordination	INFANCY												Parental responsiveness to infant behaviors is a strong predictor of infants' language and cognitive outcomes. The mechanisms underlying this effect, however, are relatively unknown. We examined the effects of parent speech on infants' visual attention, manual actions, hand-eye coordination, and dyadic joint attention during parent-infant free play. We report on two studies that used head-mounted eye trackers in increasingly naturalistic laboratory environments. In Study 1, 12-to-24-month-old infants and their parents played on the floor of a seminaturalistic environment with 24 toys. In Study 2, a different sample of dyads played in a home-like laboratory with 10 toys and no restrictions on their movement. In both studies, we present evidence that responsive parent speech extends the duration of infants' multimodal attention. This social "boost" of parent speech impacts multiple behaviors that have been linked to later outcomes-visual attention, manual actions, hand-eye coordination, and joint attention. Further, the amount that parents talked during the interaction was negatively related to the effects of parent speech on infant attention. Together, these results provide evidence of a trade-off between quantity of speech and its effects, suggesting multiple pathways through which parents impact infants' multimodal attention to shape the moment-by-moment dynamics of an interaction.

Lability of prenatal stress during the COVID-19 pandemic links to negative affect in infancy	INFANCY												The association between prenatal stress and children's socioemotional development is well established. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a particularly stressful period, which may impact the gestational environment. However, most studies to-date have examined prenatal stress at a single time point, potentially masking the natural variation in stress that occurs over time, especially during a time as uncertain as the pandemic. This study leveraged dense ecological momentary assessments from a prenatal randomized control trial to examine patterns of prenatal stress over a 14-week period (up to four assessments/day) in a U.S. sample of 72 mothers and infants. We first examined whether varied features of stress exposure (lability, mean, and baseline stress) differed depending on whether mothers reported on their stress before or during the pandemic. We next examined which features of stress were associated with 3-month-old infants' negative affect. We did not find differences in stress patterns before and during the pandemic. However, greater stress lability, accounting for baseline and mean stress, was associated with higher infant negative affect. These findings suggest that pathways from prenatal stress exposure to infant socioemotional development are complex, and close attention to stress patterns over time will be important for explicating these pathways.

We explore the impact of these semantic relations in the emerging lexicon. Using the head-turn preference procedure, we show that 18-month-old infants have begun to construct a semantic network of associatively and taxonomically related words, such as dog-cat or apple-cheese. We demonstrate that priming between words is longer-lasting when the relationship is both taxonomic and associative, as opposed to purely taxonomic, reflecting the associative boost reported in the adult priming literature. Our results demonstrate that 18-month-old infants are able to construct a lexical-semantic network based on associative and taxonomic relations between words in the network, and that lexical-semantic links are more robust when they are both associative and taxonomic in character. Furthermore, the manner in which activation is propagated through the emerging lexical-semantic network appears to depend upon the type of semantic relation between words. We argue that 18-month-old infants have a mental lexicon that shares important structural and processing properties with that of the adult system.

Confirmed infections or having to quarantine, as well as public health measures negatively affect parents and infants. Contrary to previous studies mainly focusing on the well-being of school-aged children and their parents during lockdown periods, the present study investigated how mothers of infants respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and whether this is related to maternal well-being, maternal socio-emotional investment, and infant regulation. Between April and June 2021, 206 mothers of infants (M-age = 7.14 months, SDage = 3.75 months) reported on COVID-19 infections, their response to the COVID-19 pandemic, their well-being, socio-emotional investment, and their infant's regulation. Exploratory factor analyses yielded five dimensions of maternal response to the COVID-19 pandemic: social distancing, worrying about the child, birth anxiety, distancing from the child, and information on COVID-19-related parenting behavior and support. These dimensions were related to mother-reported infant regulatory problems. Path analyses revealed paths via reduced maternal well-being and maternal socio-emotional investment. Maternal perceptions of infant regulatory problems are related to how the mothers respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Better information about COVID-19-related parenting behavior and support might buffer against these effects.

J	Foley, S; Hughes, C; Fink, E				Foley, Sarah; Hughes, Claire; Fink, Elian			Expectant mothers' not fathers' mind-mindedness predicts infant, mother, and father conversational turns at 7 months	INFANCY												Parental mind-mindedness (MM), defined as the propensity to view one's child as an agent with thoughts, feelings, and desires, is associated with positive child outcomes (McMahon & Bernier, 2017) and can be assessed in expectant parents by using five-minute speech samples (Magana et al., 1986). Individual differences in MM appear stable across the transition to parenthood (Foley et al., in press), offering an exciting intervention opportunity, as expectant mothers' thoughts and feelings about their unborn infants are associated with the quality of mother-infant interactions. To assess prenatal MM as a predictor of parent-infant conversation at 7 months, we followed 93 low-risk British heterosexual couples across the transition to parenthood. Mothers' and fathers' MM was measured both in the third trimester of pregnancy and at 4 months. Wearable LENA devices were used to gather detailed measures of mother-, father-, and infant-initiated conversations at 7 months. Prenatal MM in both parents was associated with more frequent infant-initiated conversations at 7 months, while prenatal maternal (not paternal) MM was also associated with more mother- and father-initiated conversations. While longitudinal research with more diverse samples is needed, these findings highlight the importance of parental mentalizing in the prenatal period for early family interactions.

The pandemic has intensified variations in home environments through exacerbating socioeconomic inequalities, and increasing psychological stressors for some families. This study investigates the effects of parental (predominantly maternal) mental health, enriching activities and screen use on 280 24- to 52-month-olds' executive functions, internalising and externalising problems, and pro-social behaviour; with socioeconomic status and social support as contextual factors. Our results indicate that aspects of the home environment are differentially associated with children's cognitive and psycho-social development. Parents who experienced sustained mental distress during the pandemic tended to report higher child externalising and internalising problems, and executive function difficulties at follow-up. Children who spent more time engaged in enriching activities with their parents showed stronger executive functions and social competence six months later. Screen use levels during the first year of the pandemic were not associated with outcomes. To mitigate the risk of persistent negative effects for this 'pandemic generation' of infants, our study highlights the importance of supporting parents' mental health. As our results demonstrate the impact of social support on mental health, investing in support services and interventions promoting building support networks are likely to be beneficial.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				JAN	2023	28	1			SI		158	186		10.1111/infa.12495	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12495		AUG 2022						35993691					WOS:000842562500001

The results showed that the ability to plan and execute actions according to a simple extended alternating pattern improved over toddlerhood. Furthermore, working memory and motor competence scores were both independent predictors of the ability to plan and execute simple alternating actions. These findings underscore the fact that between 24 and 36 months of age is a period in which the ability to string together multiple actions in a sequence to achieve a distal goal is still developing.

This study assessed attention to the mouth and the eyes at 5.5 (n = 91; Polish, 49% females) and 11 months, between time-point changes and their associations with language development in infancy (11 months) and toddlerhood (24 months). Sex differences were also explored. Results showed an age-related increase in looking to the mouth, and the magnitude of this change was associated with productive language, but only in toddlerhood. By contrast, looking to the eyes did not change and its duration at 5.5 months correlated with language development at 2 years. Exploratory analyses showed that in females but not males, reduced mouth-looking was related to better language outcomes in toddlerhood. Thus, looking to the mouth in infancy likely plays a long-term role in language acquisition and is potentially modulated by participant sex.

J	Essler, S; Paulus, M				Essler, Samuel; Paulus, Markus			Caregivers' everyday moral reasoning predicts young children's aggressive, prosocial, and moral development: Evidence from ambulatory assessment	INFANCY												Developmental theories have proposed caregiver reactions, in particular caregivers' moral reasoning with their children, as crucial factors in children's developing morality. Yet, empirical evidence is scarce and mainly restricted to laboratory contexts. Here, we used the ambulatory assessment method to investigate how caregiver responses to moral transgressions longitudinally relate to children's emerging moral agency. On the first measurement point, mothers (N = 220) reported on nine consecutive evenings on a moral transgression of their 5- to 46-month-olds', their emotional and verbal reactions, and how in turn their child reacted. Five months later, mothers reported on their child's aggressive and prosocial (helping, sharing, comforting) behavior. Our results demonstrated that (1) caregiver reasoning supported children's sharing and comforting behavior and was related to lower levels of children's aggressive behavior half a year later, that (2) caregiver reasoning reactions supported children's negative evaluations of their own transgressions while compliance-based caregiver reactions (e.g., physical interventions, reprimands) were predictive of children's subsequent emotional distress and anger, and that (3) caregiver social conformity and reflective functioning abilities emerged as determinants of caregiver negative moral emotions. Thus, this study uses an innovative methodological approach to uncover key characteristics of caregiver moral reactions supporting the development of morality.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV	2022	27	6					1068	1090		10.1111/infa.12493	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12493		AUG 2022						35959707					WOS:000839569300001

Because grandparents faced higher COVID-19 risks due to age, many used video chat instead of interacting with their infant grandchildren in person. We conducted a semi-naturalistic, longitudinal study with 48 families, each of whom submitted a series of video chats and surveys, and most (n = 40) also submitted a video of an in-person interaction. Families were mostly highly-educated, White/Caucasian, and lived between 1 and 2700 miles apart. We used multilevel models to examine grandparents' and parents' sensitivity during video chat across time (centered at February 1, 2021, the approximate date of vaccine availability). Grandparent video chat sensitivity changed as a function of date and parent sensitivity. Parent sensitivity changed as a function of date, grandparent sensitivity, and geographic distance. We then modeled infants' affective valence during video chat and in-person interactions with their grandparents, which was only predicted by grandparent sensitivity, not modality or other factors. This study demonstrates that caregivers were sensitive toward infants during video chat interactions despite fluctuations in family stress and reduced in-person contact during COVID-19 and that grandparent sensitivity predicted positive infant affect during both video chat and in-person interactions.

J	Franchak, JM; Kadooka, K				Franchak, John M.; Kadooka, Kellan			Age differences in orienting to faces in dynamic scenes depend on face centering, not visual saliency	INFANCY												The current study investigated how infants (6-24 months), children (2-12 years), and adults differ in how visual cues-visual saliency and centering-guide their attention to faces in videos. We report a secondary analysis of Kadooka and Franchak (2020), in which observers' eye movements were recorded during viewing of television clips containing a variety of faces. For every face on every video frame, we calculated its visual saliency (based on both static and dynamic image features) and calculated how close the face was to the center of the image. Results revealed that participants of every age looked more often at each face when it was more salient compared to less salient. In contrast, centering did not increase the likelihood that infants looked at a given face, but in later childhood and adulthood, centering became a stronger cue for face looking. A control analysis determined that the age-related change in centering was specific to face looking; participants of all ages were more likely to look at the center of the image, and this center bias did not change with age. The implications for using videos in educational and diagnostic contexts are discussed.

Given that audiovisual speech, normally available in a talker's mouth, is perceptually more salient than auditory speech and that it facilitates speech processing and language acquisition, we investigated whether 15-month-old infants' NAD learning is modulated by attention to a talker's mouth. Infants performed an audiovisual NAD learning task while we recorded their selective attention to the eyes, mouth, and face of an actress while she spoke an artificial language that followed an AXB structure (tis-X-bun; nal-X-gor) during familiarization. At test, the actress spoke the same language (grammatical trials; tis-X-bun; nal-X-gor) or a novel one that violated the AXB structure (ungrammatical trials; tis-X-gor; nal-X-bun). Overall, total duration of looking did not differ during the familiar and novel test trials but the time-course of selective attention to the talker's face and mouth revealed that the novel trials maintained infants' attention to the face more than did the familiar trials. Crucially, attention to the mouth increased during the novel test trials while it did not change during the familiar test trials. These results indicate that the multisensory redundancy of audiovisual speech facilitates infants' discrimination of non-adjacent dependencies.

Turkish is a sound symbolically rich language that allows flexible use of such words in different linguistic forms. The current study examined Turkish-speaking parents' use of sound symbolic words to their 14- and 20-month-olds and the concurrent and longitudinal relations between parents' sound symbolic input and infants' vocabulary knowledge. Thirty-four (n = 34) infants were observed at Time-1 (M-age = 14.23 months, SD = 1.11) and Time-2 (M-age = 20.30 months, SD = 1.24) during free play sessions with their parents to examine parental input. Infants' vocabulary knowledge was assessed by a parental report. Both the quantity and quality of parental sound symbolic input changed between 14 and 20 months of age. Furthermore, infants' earlier vocabulary knowledge at 14 months negatively predicted parents' later sound symbolic input at 20 months. Last, parents' sound symbolic input was positively and concurrently associated with 14-month-olds' vocabulary knowledge but was negatively and concurrently associated with 20-month-olds' vocabulary levels. These findings suggest an early interaction between infants' exposure to sound symbolic input and their vocabulary development.

Infants who experience more adult-initiated conversations have better expressive language in toddlerhood	INFANCY												To understand how infants become engaged in conversations with their caregivers, we examined who tends to initiate conversations between adults and infants, differences between the features of infant- and adult-initiated conversations, and whether individual differences in how much infants engage in infant- or adult-initiated conversations uniquely predict later language development. We analyzed naturalistic adult-infant conversations captured via passive recording of the daily environment in two samples of 6-month-old infants. In Study 1, we found that at age 6 months, infants typically engage in more adult- than infant-initiated conversations and that adult-initiated conversations are, on average, longer and contain more adult words. In Study 2, we replicated these findings and, further, found that infants who engaged in more adult-initiated conversations in infancy had better expressive language at age 18 months. This association remained significant when accounting for the number of infant-initiated conversations at 6 months. Our findings indicate that early interactions with caregivers can have a lasting impact on children's language development, and that the extent to which parents initiate interactions with their infants may be particularly important.

How experience shapes infants' communicative behaviour: Comparing gaze following in infants with and without pandemic experience	INFANCY												The COVID-19 pandemic has been influencing people's social life substantially. Everybody, including infants and children needed to adapt to changes in social interactions (e.g., social distancing) and to seeing other people wearing facial masks. In this study, we investigated whether these pandemic-related changes influenced 12- to 15-months-old infants' reactions to observed gaze shifts (i.e., their gaze following). In two eye-tracking tasks, we measured infants' gaze-following behavior during the pandemic (with-COVID-19-experience sample) and compared it to data of infants tested before the pandemic (no-COVID-19-experience sample). Overall, the results indicated no significant differences between the two samples. However, in one sub-task infants in the with-COVID-19-experience sample looked longer at the eyes of a model compared to the no-COVID-19-experience sample. Within the with-COVID-19-experience sample, the amount of mask exposure and the number of contacts without mask were not related to infants' gaze-following behavior. We speculate that even though infants encounter fewer different people during the pandemic and are increasingly exposed to people wearing facial masks, they still also see non-covered faces. These contacts might be sufficient to provide infants with the social input they need to develop social and emotional competencies such as gaze following.

Average fixation duration in infancy: Stability and predictive utility	INFANCY												The current study examined the stability, consistency, and predictive utility of average fixation durations in infancy. In Study 1, infants' (N = 80) average fixation duration when viewing social stimuli was found to show strong relative stability from 3.5 to 9 months of age. In Study 2, strong within-infant consistency was found in 3.5-month-old infants' (N = 73) average fixation durations to social and nonsocial stimuli. In Study 3, 3.5- to 9-month-old infants' (N = 89) average fixation duration was found to systematically vary with parent-reported symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) at 4-6 years of age. These results suggest that average fixation duration serves as a stable and systematic measure of individual differences in cognitive development beginning early in life.

J	Zacharaki, K; Sebastian-Galles, N				Zacharaki, Konstantina; Sebastian-Galles, Nuria			Before perceptual narrowing: The emergence of the native sounds of language	INFANCY												The present study investigates the precursors of representations of phonemes in 4.5-month-olds. The emergence of phonemes has been mainly studied within the framework of perceptual narrowing, that is, infants tuning to their native language and losing sensitivity to non-native speech. One of the mechanisms behind this phenomenon is distributional learning. In this article, we tested the preference of 4.5-month-old infants using lists of pseudowords that resemble the vowel distribution of the native or a non-native language. We found that infants prefer listening to the lists mirroring the native language. The results suggest that infants can extract vowel information from novel stimuli, and they can map it on pre-existing knowledge on vowels that leads to a preference for the native lists.

J	Stahl, AE; Woods, L				Stahl, Aimee E.; Woods, Larissa			Infants preferentially learn from surprising teachers	INFANCY												Infants have sophisticated knowledge about the physical world, and show enhanced learning about objects that violate physical principles. However, it is unknown whether infants also preferentially learn from the individual who produces an outcome that violates expectations. We investigated whether 15-month-old infants (N = 48) selectively imitate individuals who produce surprising outcomes. In Experiment 1, infants watched an experimenter hide a ball and produce an expected outcome in which the ball was revealed where it was hidden, or a surprising outcome in which the ball was revealed in a different location. The experimenter then demonstrated a novel action: using her head to activate a light while her hands were free. Infants imitated that novel action more if the experimenter had previously produced a surprising than an expected outcome. In Experiment 2, infants witnessed the experimenter produce the surprising outcome, then use her head to activate the light while her hands were occupied. Infants did not differentially imitate the head-touch action relative to either condition in Experiment 1, perhaps indicating a tension between surprise-induced learning and rational imitation. These experiments show that surprising events are pedagogical opportunities: infants selectively learn from surprising individuals, but also may account for rationality in their surprise-induced social learning.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				SEP	2022	27	5					887	899		10.1111/infa.12485	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12485		MAY 2022						35616335					WOS:000800235400001

Previous studies revealed that the experimental presentation of social rivals evokes protest in as early as 6 months old infants. This study replicated research on jealousy protests in a novel language and sociocultural context with 10-20 months old infants. We compared protests of 45 children when their mothers attended to each of the rivals and controlled for attachment dimensions. As hypothesized, infants had a stronger jealousy protest to the social rival, and their response was associated with attachment avoidance. We concluded that our results contribute to evidence on jealousy protest as an evolutionary rooted phenomenon that favors the mother's attention in a social rivalry scenario over nonsocial stimuli. Attachment avoidance may be a precluding factor of jealousy when faced with a social rival scenario that deserves further research.

J	Sun, LC; Yoshida, H				Sun, Lichao; Yoshida, Hanako			Why the parent's gaze is so powerful in organizing the infant's gaze: The relationship between parental referential cues and infant object looking	INFANCY												Parental scaffolding such as looking at and showing objects has long been considered to be helpful for early attention and language development. However, relatively little is known about how parental social multimodal cues work alone or together in guiding an infant's attention toward the referent items. The present study aims to document the dynamics of social referential input during an interactive play session and specify the different types of social cues in directing infant attention. Forty-three parent-infant dyads (infants aged from 5.0 to 18.0 months) in the U.S. completed a short play session recorded by head-mounted camera with eye-trackers. The present findings suggest that joint attention between parent and infant toward the same referent item often co-occurred with other referential input. Infants were more likely to maintain sustained attention to an object under the circumstance that the parent looked at the same item and named it explicitly. This was not the case when parent object looking accompanied other utterances, like "Look!" or the child's name. The present study highlights the importance of multimodal referential input, which sets up enriched opportunities for children to become sensitive to social input and develop sustained attention for further learning.

In this study, we focus on associations between these variables and 2-year-old's (N = 87) vocabulary. Child vocabulary and digital media use were measured through online questionnaires. We took a multimethod approach to measure parents' child-directed talk. First, we used a home sound environment recording (Language ENvironment Analysis technology) to estimate parents' talk (CTT). Second, parents narrated a picture book, the Frog story, to assess the parent's MST. There was a negative association between how much children watched video content and their vocabulary. However, parents reported that they frequently co-viewed and engaged with the child and media. The negative association first displayed between the amount of video content viewed and the child's developing vocabulary was fully mediated by the parents' qualitative and quantitative talk as measured by MST and CCT, respectively. We propose that the parent relative level of MST and CTT also occurs when parents engage with the child during media use.

J	Monroy, C; Yu, C; Houston, D				Monroy, Claire; Yu, Chen; Houston, Derek			Visual statistical learning in deaf and hearing infants and toddlers	INFANCY												Congenital hearing loss offers a unique opportunity to examine the role of sound in cognitive, social, and linguistic development. Children with hearing loss demonstrate atypical performance across a range of general cognitive skills. For instance, research has shown that deaf school-age children underperform on visual statistical learning (VSL) tasks. However, the evidence for these deficits has been challenged, with mixed findings emerging in recent years. Here, we used a novel approach to examine VSL in the action domain early in development. We compared learning between deaf and hearing infants, prior to cochlear implantation (pre-CI), and a group of toddlers post implantation (post-CI). Findings revealed a significant difference between deaf and hearing infants pre-CI, with evidence for learning only in the hearing infants. However, there were no significant group differences between deaf and hearing toddlers post-CI, with both groups demonstrating learning. Further, VSL performance was positively correlated with language scores for the deaf toddlers, adding to the body of evidence suggesting that statistical learning is associated with language abilities. We discuss these findings in the context of previous evidence for group differences in VSL skills, and the role that auditory experiences play in infant cognitive development.

Maternal anxiety symptoms associated with increased behavioral synchrony in the early postnatal period	INFANCY												The presence of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders has typically been associated with decreases in the quality of mother-infant interactions. However, maternal anxiety symptoms during the postpartum period have been less studied than other mental health disorders like depression. In the current study, we examined associations among symptoms of maternal anxiety, maternal perceived stress, and mother-infant behavioral synchrony in the early postnatal period. Eighty-one mother-infant dyads participated in this study when the infants were 3 months old. Surveys were given to obtain demographic information and current maternal mental health symptoms, and dyads completed a 5-min free-play task to measure behavioral synchrony. Results indicated that maternal anxiety symptoms were positively associated with behavioral synchrony, but only for mothers reporting moderate levels of perceived stress. These findings highlight the differential impact of maternal postpartum mental health on behavioral synchrony and suggest that higher maternal anxiety symptoms during the postnatal period may play an adaptive role in fostering more dynamic mother-infant interactions.

We provide a guide for conducting a transparent and reproducible meta-analysis in the field of developmental psychology within the framework of the MetaLab platform, in 10 steps: (1) Choose a topic for your meta-analysis, (2) Formulate your research question and specify inclusion criteria, (3) Preregister and document all stages of your meta-analysis, (4) Conduct the literature search, (5) Collect and screen records, (6) Extract data from eligible studies, (7) Read the data into analysis software and compute effect sizes, (8) Visualize your data, (9) Create meta-analytic models to assess the strength of the effect and investigate possible moderators, (10) Write up and promote your meta-analysis. Meta-analyses can inform future studies, through power calculations, by identifying robust methods and exposing research gaps. By adding a new meta-analysis to MetaLab, datasets across multiple topics of developmental psychology can be synthesized, and the dataset can be maintained as a living, community-augmented meta-analysis to which researchers add new data, allowing for a cumulative approach to evidence synthesis.

In the current study, we investigated the impact of three challenges that infants need to overcome to learn new words and expand the size of their vocabulary. We used longitudinal eye-tracking data (n = 118) to assess sequence learning, associative learning, and probability processing abilities at ages 6, 10, and 18 months. Infants' ability to efficiently solve these tasks was used to predict vocabulary size at age 18 months. We demonstrate that the ability to make audio-visual associations and to predict sequences of visual events predicts vocabulary size in toddlers (accounting for 20% of the variance). Our results indicate that statistical learning in some, but not all, domains have a role in vocabulary development.

While infants at this age can already individuate human-like objects from non-humanlike ones and self-propelled agents from inert objects, little is known of when and how they start individuating within the domain of agents. What is clear from previous studies is that differences in surface and dynamic features are not sufficient. We hypothesized that mental properties-in this case the agents' preferences-can serve as an individuating property. In our study, we familiarized infants with two animated agents who had different preferences. The agents sequentially and repeatedly emerged from behind an occluder, and then each agent approached one of two target objects before returning behind the occluder. After familiarization, the occluder was lifted, revealing either one agent or two agents. While infants successfully individuated the agents in the preference-demonstration condition, they failed to do so in the exposure-only condition in which perceptually similar surface and dynamic features of the agents were presented but without indicating preferences. Our study thus provides evidence that mental properties can help individuate agents, grounding the claim that infants understand agents as mental entities at their core.

J	Germain, N; Gonzalez-Barrero, AM; Byers-Heinlein, K				Germain, Nathalie; Gonzalez-Barrero, Ana Maria; Byers-Heinlein, Krista			Gesture development in infancy: Effects of gender but not bilingualism	INFANCY												Gesture is an important communication tool that provides insight into infants' early language and cognitive development and predicts later language skills. While bilingual school-age children have been reported to gesture more than monolinguals, there is a lack of research examining gesture use in infants exposed to more than one language. In this preregistered study, we compared three groups of 14-month-old infants (N = 150) learning French and/or English: bilinguals (hearing a second language at least 25% of the time), exposed (hearing a second language 10%-24% of the time), and monolinguals (hearing one language 90% of the time or more). Parent-reported use of communicative gestures was gathered from the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (CDI). Results showed that the three language groups had similarly sized gesture repertoires, suggesting that language exposure did not affect gesture development at this age. However, a gender effect was found, where girls produced more types of gestures than boys. Overall, these results suggest that gender, but not language exposure, contributes to differences in gesture development in infancy.

Despite the ubiquity of gaze-related methods in developmental science, current analysis techniques usually involve laborious post hoc coding, imprecise real-time coding, or expensive eye trackers that may increase data loss and require a calibration phase. As an alternative, we propose using computer vision methods to perform automatic gaze estimation from low-resolution videos. At the core of our approach is a neural network that classifies gaze directions in real time. We compared our method, called iCatcher, to manually annotated videos from a prior study in which infants looked at one of two pictures on a screen. We demonstrated that the accuracy of iCatcher approximates that of human annotators and that it replicates the prior study's results. Our method is publicly available as an open-source repository at .

Beyond the familial: The development of emotional communication with mothers, fathers, and strangers	INFANCY												Interaction with unfamiliar partners is a component of social life from infancy onward. Yet little is known about preverbal communication with strangers. This study compared the development of infant communication with strangers to communication with mothers and fathers and examined the contribution of temperament to partner-specific communication patterns. A sample of 58 infants was observed at four and eight months during separate home-based face-to-face interactions with three partners (mother, father, and stranger). Infant visual, facial, and vocal communication behaviors were coded microanalytically. Each parent reported on infant temperament at both ages. Multilevel regression analyses indicated that infants gazed longer at strangers than at fathers, exhibited less smiling to strangers than to mothers, and produced fewer vocalizations with strangers than with either parent. Both age and temperament moderated these differences. Vocal communication with fathers became more frequent at eight months; smiling to mothers was accentuated among infants with higher levels of temperamental surgency. Importantly, levels of communication behaviors with strangers were concurrently and longitudinally associated with those with mothers and fathers. Overall, findings suggest that infant emotional communication patterns are modulated by individual temperamental differences and are reproduced in and over time, though at different levels, when interacting with novel partners.

J	Babineau, M; Christophe, A				Babineau, Mireille; Christophe, Anne			Preverbal infants' sensitivity to grammatical dependencies	INFANCY												During their first months of life, infants can already distinguish function words (e.g., pronouns and determiners) from content words (e.g., verbs and nouns). Little research has explored preverbal infants' sensitivity to the relationships between these word categories. This preregistered study examines whether French-learning 8- and 11-month-olds track the grammatical dependencies between determiners and nouns as well as pronouns and verbs. Using the Visual Fixation Procedure, infants were presented with lists containing either grammatical (e.g., tu manges "you eat", des biberons "some bottles") or ungrammatical (e.g., des manges "some eat", tu biberons "you bottle") phrases. In Experiment 1 (N = 59), the lists involved common nouns and verbs, while in Experiment 2 (N = 28), only common verbs were used. Eleven-month-olds showed a clear preference for correct over incorrect co-occurrences in both experiments, while 8-month-olds showed a trend in the same direction. These results suggest that before their first birthday, infants' storage and access of words and word sequences are sufficiently sophisticated to include the means to track categorical dependencies. This early sensitivity to co-occurrence patterns may be greatly beneficial for constraining lexical access and later on for learning novel words' syntactic and semantic properties.

Maternal sensitivity during mealtime and free play: Differences and explanatory factors	INFANCY												Mealtime is a parent-toddler interaction that occurs multiple times a day. This study examined whether observed maternal sensitivity differed between a mealtime and free-play setting, aiming to explain differences between the two situations by studying moderating effects of children's eating behavior. The sample consisted of 103 first-time mothers and their 18-month-old children. Maternal sensitivity was assessed by coding videotaped interactions of free-play sessions and mealtimes, using the Ainsworth Sensitivity Scale (range 1-9). Additionally, child eating behavior during the meal was coded and also assessed through the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire-Toddlers. First, a small but significant amount of stability was found between sensitivity during mealtime and sensitivity during play (r = 0.24). Second, mothers were more sensitive during free play (mean = 7.11) than during mealtime (mean = 6.52). Third, observed child eating behavior was related to maternal sensitivity during mealtime, with more food enjoyment being associated with higher levels of sensitivity, and more challenging child behavior with lower levels of sensitivity. Finally, when children showed a high degree of challenging behavior during the meal, there was more discrepancy between sensitivity during mealtime and free play. Our results highlight the importance of taking context into account when observing parental sensitivity.

We systematically investigated the influence of social features (schematic eyes vs. reverse-contrast eyes) and gaze-contingent reinforcement (elicited vs. not elicited) on 4-month-olds' learning to attend to gaze-cued objects. In 4 experiments, we tested infants' (N = 74) gaze following of a turning block with schematic or reverse-contrast eyes. In Experiments 1 and 2, infants could elicit an attractive animation in a training phase via interactive eye tracking by following the turning of the block. Experiments 3 and 4 were yoked controls without contingent reinforcement. Infants did not spontaneously follow the motion of the block. Four-month-olds always followed the block after training when it featured schematic eyes. When the block featured reverse-contrast eyes, the training phase only affected infants' looking behavior without reinforcement. While speaking to a certain degree of plasticity, findings stress the importance of eyes for guiding infants' attention.

The current study examines 12-month-olds' capacity to extract statistical information from a sequence of emotional faces. Using a familiarization procedure, infants were presented with videos of two actresses expressing the same facial emotion, and subsequently turning toward or away from each other. Videos displayed different emotions (i.e., anger, happiness, fear, sadness, surprise, amusement, disgust, and exasperation) and were organized sequentially, so that the transitional probabilities between videos were highly predictable in some cases, and less predictable in others. At test, infants discriminated highly predictable from low predictable transitional probabilities, suggesting that they extracted statistical regularities from the sequence of emotional faces. However, when examining the looking toward and the looking away conditions separately, infants showed evidence of statistical learning in the looking toward condition only. Together, these findings suggest that 12-month-old infants rely on statistical learning to segment a continuous sequence of emotional faces, although this ability can be modulated by the nature of the stimuli. The contribution of statistical learning to structure infants' social environment is discussed.

We examine this question by testing predictions of a dynamic field (DF) model of infant spatial attention. We tested 5-, 7-, and 10-month-old infants in the Infant Orienting With Attention (IOWA) task containing the original non-competitive cue conditions (when a central stimulus disappeared before a cue onset) and new competitive cue conditions (when a central stimulus remained visible throughout the trial). This allowed testing of five model predictions: (1) that orienting accuracy would be higher and (2) reaction times would be slower for all competitive conditions; (3) that all infants would be slower to orient in the competitive conditions, though (4) older infants would show the strongest competition costs; and (5) that reaction times would be particularly slow for un-cued competitive conditions. Four of these five predictions were supported, and the remaining prediction was supported in part. We next examined fits of the model to the expanded task. New simulation results reveal close fits to the present findings after parameter modification. Critically, developmental parameters of the model were not altered, providing support for the DF model's account of neuro-developmental change.

INFANCY												Mother-infant synchrony is one of the most important processes in the development of socio-affective competencies in children. While maternal abilities and psychopathology are related to maladaptive mother-infant synchrony, it is as yet unclear how maternal emotion regulation difficulties contribute to it. Based on a panel of behavioral indicators (i.e., gaze, vocal, and motor), the present study examined mother-infant synchrony at 6 months of age in a modified version of Ainsworth's Strange Situation (n = 72 dyads). Mother-infant interaction sequences were characterized by indicators of complexity (LZ complexity of joint behavioral sequences) and of synchronization quality (cross-recurrence plot quantification). Results showed that mothers' touch was greater in the reunion condition than in the initial condition. Mothers' motor behaviors were associated with the global levels of infants' behavioral involvement in the reunion condition, unlike the symmetrical influence observed between mothers and infants in the initial condition. Results show that maternal anxiety mediates the relationships between mothers' emotion regulation difficulties and gaze, vocal, and motor synchrony between mothers and infants in the initial and reunion conditions. This study emphasizes the central role of maternal emotion regulation difficulties in the establishment of maladaptive synchrony and in the adjustments of maternal physical contacts with infants.

Grounded in theoretical concepts of family systems theory and the spillover effect, the goal of the current study was to examine whether prenatal spousal support predicts toddler emotion recognition at 24 months, and whether this association is mediated by parental embodied mentalizing (PEM) at 6 months. PEM refers to the parent's capacity to understand the infant's mental states from his or her whole-body kinesthetic expressions and adjust their own kinesthetic patterns accordingly. One hundred and five families expecting their first child were included in the study. Results indicated that maternal PEM mediated the relationship between prenatal dyadic positive and overall support and toddler emotion recognition. Paternal PEM was not found to be related to either dyadic support or to toddler emotion recognition, and it did not mediate the relationship between the two. The findings of the current study support the importance of including both parents' embodied mentalizing and a systemic approach to illuminate child development. A significant clinical implication from this study is the usefulness of prenatal couple interventions to improve mutual support and communication as it can promote parents' parental mentalizing and ultimately the child's emotion recognition capacity.

J	Sucevic, J; Althaus, N; Plunkett, K				Sucevic, Jelena; Althaus, Nadja; Plunkett, Kim			Discovering category boundaries: The role of comparison in infants' novel category learning	INFANCY												A key question in categorization is how infants extract regularities from the exemplars they encounter. Detecting similarities and dissimilarities across items is vital in order to determine category-relevant features. Previous research found evidence that infants acquire a single category more easily with paired presentations in comparison with single presentations (Oakes & Ribar, 2005, Infancy, 7, 85; Oakes & Kovack-Lesh, 2007, Cogni ție, Creier, Comportament / Cognition, Brain, Behavior, XI, 661). Here, we focus on infants' acquisition of a category contrast, that is, when they are exposed to two categories. In an eye-tracking study, we examined 10-month-old infants' ability to learn two novel visual categories when presented with one item at a time and with items in pairs. Infants were familiarized with pairs of items from the same category or with pairs of items from different categories (cross-category pairs). Using a linear model with a priori contrasts, we show that infants' learning is directly related to the opportunity for category comparison: There is no evidence of category learning in the single-item condition, improved performance when familiarized with same-category pairs, and finally robust category learning when familiarized with cross-category pairs. We conclude that comparison which involves items from different categories promotes category formation, by highlighting differences and promoting a discovery of category boundaries.

In this parent-report study of 575 UK-based 8- to 36 month olds (218 followed longitudinally), we investigate how variation in the home environment before and during the 2020 pandemic relates to infants' emerging EFs. Parent-infant enriching activities were positively associated with infant Cognitive Executive Function (CEF) (encompassing inhibitory control, working memory, cognitive flexibility). During the most-restrictive UK lockdown-but not subsequently-socioeconomic status (SES) was positively associated with levels of parent-infant enriching activities. Parents who regard fostering early learning, affection, and attachment as important were more likely to engage in parent-infant enriching activities, yet there was no significant pathway from parental attitudes or SES to CEF via activities. Infant screen use was negatively associated with CEF and Regulation. Screen use fully mediated the effect of SES on CEF, and partially mediated the effect of SES on regulation. Parental attitudes toward early learning, affection, and attachment did not significantly influence screen use. These results indicate that although parental attitudes influence the development of early EFs, interventions targeting attitudes as a means of increasing enriching activities, and thus EF are likely to be less effective than reducing barriers to engaging in enriching activities.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAY	2022	27	3					555	581		10.1111/infa.12460	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12460		JAN 2022						35102670					WOS:000748769200001

Little is known about the exploration strategies adopted to efficiently discriminate frequent, familiar face types. The present eye-tracking study examined the distribution of visual fixations produced by 10-month-old and 4-month-old singletons while learning adult (i.e., familiar) and child (i.e., unfamiliar) White faces. Infants were tested in an infant-controlled visual habituation task, in which post-habituation preference measured successful discrimination. Results confirmed earlier evidence that, without sibling experience, 10-month-olds discriminate only among adult faces. Analyses of gaze movements during habituation showed that infants' fixations were centered in the upper part of the stimuli. The mouth was sampled longer in adult faces than in child faces, while the child eyes were sampled longer and more frequently than the adult eyes. At 10 months, but not at 4 months, global measures of scanning behavior on the whole face also varied according to face age, as the spatiotemporal distribution of scan paths showed larger within- and between-participants similarity for adult faces than for child faces. Results are discussed with reference to the perceptual narrowing literature, and the influence of age-appropriate developmental tasks on infants' face processing abilities.

J	Goupil, N; Papeo, L; Hochmann, JR				Goupil, Nicolas; Papeo, Liuba; Hochmann, Jean-Remy			Visual perception grounding of social cognition in preverbal infants	INFANCY												Social life is inherently relational, entailing the ability to recognize and monitor social entities and the relationships between them. Very young infants privilege socially relevant entities in the visual world, such as faces and bodies. Here, we show that six-month-old infants also discriminate between configurations of multiple human bodies, based on the internal visuo-spatial relations between bodies, which could cue-or not-social interaction. We measured the differential looking times for two images, each featuring two identical bodies, but in different spatial relations. Infants discriminated between face-to-face and back-to-back body dyads (Experiment 1), and treated face-to-face dyads with higher efficiency (i.e., processing speed), relative to back-to-back dyads (Experiment 2). Looking times for dyads in an asymmetrical relation (i.e., one body facing another without reciprocation) were comparable to looking times for face-to-face dyads, and differed from looking times to back-to-back dyads, suggesting general discrimination between the presence versus absence of relation (Experiment 3). Infants' discrimination of images based on relative positioning of items did not generalize to body-object pairs (Experiment 4). Early sensitivity to the relative positioning of bodies in a scene may be a building block of social cognition, preparing the discovery of the keel and backbone of social life: relations.

J	Bacon, D; Saffran, J				Bacon, Desia; Saffran, Jenny			Role of speaker gender in toddler lexical processing	INFANCY												Adults and children utilize social category information during incremental language processing. Gender is a particularly salient social category that is often marked both in speakers' voices and the visual world. However, it is unknown whether toddlers exploit gender cues to draw connections between language and other aspects of their environment. The current study investigates whether toddlers use gender cues available in voices and objects during real-time language processing. 22- to 24-month-old toddlers (N = 38) were tested in a looking-while-listening paradigm. On each trial, toddlers viewed two highly familiar objects designed to be prototypically masculine and feminine (via color and patterns) and heard either a male or female speaker label the target object. Lexical processing was facilitated when the vocal gender matched the gender of the target object. This work demonstrates that toddlers consider both object-feature information and inferred speaker gender (based on speaker' voice) during online language processing.

Fathers' language input in North American bilingual Latinx families	INFANCY												This study examines the language environments of bilingually raised Latinx infants (n = 37) in mother-father families of diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, with a focus on paternal parentese, a speaking style distinguished by higher pitch, slower tempo, and exaggerated intonation. Two daylong audio recordings were collected on weekends, when both parents were at home. Paternal, maternal, and infant speech variables were quantified through automatic and manual analyses. Most infants experienced Spanish and English within child-directed speech, and language mixing was common in mothers and fathers. Adjusting for demographic variables, infants heard 50.4% less talk from men compared to women, and 43.4% less parentese from fathers compared to mothers. However, when controlling for overall speech amount, the rate of parentese use did not differ between mothers and fathers, demonstrating that, contrary to the stereotype, fathers in Latinx families adjust their speech in verbal interactions with their infants. An asymmetry emerged, where paternal parentese was associated with paternal knowledge of language development but not with paternal involvement in childcare responsibilities; the opposite was true for paternal speech amount. Controlling for maternal contributions, paternal parentese was predictive of concurrent parent-infant turn-taking and infant language vocalizations, demonstrating its important role in infant language development.

Infants' cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) reflect cortical maturation and appear to predict subsequent language abilities. This study aimed to identify CAEP components to two auditory stimulus intensities in 1-month-old infants and to understand how these are associated with social interactive and self-regulatory behaviors. In addition, it examined whether CAEPs predicted developmental outcomes when infants were assessed at 12 months of age. At 1 month, P2 and N2 components were present for both auditory stimulus intensities, with an increased P2 amplitude being observed for the higher-intensity stimuli. We also observed that an increased P2 amplitude in the lower intensity predicted receptive and expressive language competencies at 12 months. These results are consistent with previous findings indicating an association between auditory processing and developmental outcomes in infants. This study suggests that specific auditory neurophysiological markers are associated with developmental outcomes in the first developmental year.

Autistic individuals perform poorly during conditions that require integration across multiple sensory modalities such as audiovisual (AV) integration. Previous research investigated neural processing of AV integration in infancy. Yet, this has never been studied in infants at higher likelihood of later ASD (HR) using neurophysiological (EEG/ERP) techniques. In this study, we investigated whether ERP measures of AV integration differentiate HR infants from low-risk (LR) infants and whether early AV integration abilities are associated with clinical measures of sensory responsiveness. At age 12 months, AV integration in HR (n = 21) and LR infants (n = 19) was characterized in a novel ERP paradigm measuring the McGurk effect, and clinical measures of sensory responsiveness were evaluated. Different brain responses over the left temporal area emerge between HR and LR infants, specifically when AV stimuli cannot be integrated into a fusible percept. Furthermore, ERP responses related to integration of AV incongruent stimuli were found to be associated with sensory responsiveness, with reduced effects of AV incongruency being associated with reduced sensory reactivity. These data suggest that early identification of AV deficits may pave the way to innovative therapeutic strategies for the autistic symptomatology. Further replications in independent cohorts are needed for generalizability of findings.

J	Bulgarelli, F; Bergelson, E				Bulgarelli, Federica; Bergelson, Elika			Talker variability shapes early word representations in English-learning 8-month-olds	INFANCY												Infants must form appropriately specific representations of how words sound and what they mean. Previous research suggests that while 8-month-olds are learning words, they struggle with recognizing different-sounding instances of words (e.g., from new talkers) and with rejecting incorrect pronunciations. We asked how adding talker variability during learning may change infants' ability to learn and recognize words. Monolingual English-learning 7- to 9-month-olds heard a single novel word paired with an object in either a "no variability," "within-talker variability," or "between-talker variability" habituation. We then tested whether infants formed appropriately specific representations by changing the talker (Experiment 1a) or mispronouncing the word (Experiment 2) and by changing the trained word or object altogether (both experiments). Talker variability influenced learning. Infants trained with no-talker variability learned the word-object link, but failed to recognize the word trained by a new talker, and were insensitive to the mispronunciation. Infants trained with talker variability dishabituated only to the new object, exhibiting difficulty forming the word-object link. Neither pattern is adult-like. Results are reported for both in-lab and Zoom participants. Implications for the role of talker variability in early word learning are discussed.

Joint engagement in the home environment is frequent, multimodal, timely, and structured	INFANCY												Infants develop in a social context, surrounded by knowledgeable caregivers who scaffold learning through shared engagement with objects. However, researchers have typically examined joint engagement in structured tasks, where caregivers sit near infants and display frequent, prompt, and multimodal behaviors around the objects of infant action. Which features of joint engagement generalize to the real-world? Despite the importance of joint engagement for infant learning, critical assumptions around joint engagement in everyday interaction remain unexamined. We investigated behavioral and temporal features of joint engagement in the home environment, where objects for play abound and dyad proximity fluctuates. Infant manual actions, mother manual and verbal behaviors, and dyad proximity were coded frame-by-frame from 2-h naturalistic recordings of 13- to 23-month-old infants and their mothers (N = 38). Infants experienced rich, highly structured, multimodal mother input around the objects of their actions. Specifically, joint engagement occurred within seconds of infant action and was amplified in the context of interpersonal proximity. Findings validate laboratory-based research on characteristics of joint engagement while highlighting unique properties around the role of mother-infant proximity and temporal structuring of caregiver input over extended time frames. Implications for the social contexts that support infant learning and development are discussed.

We sought to identify characteristics of preterm-born infants associated with the attunement of mother-infant interactions at the corrected ages of 3-4 months, looking specifically at motor behaviors. We focused on infants' spontaneous movements, achievement of motor milestones, and temperament, which at this young age is often manifested via movement. Sixty preterm-born infants (Mdn(gestation age in weeks) = 33, 57.38% male, corrected age Mdn = 14 weeks, interquartile range = 13-16) and their mothers participated. Independent observers rated mother-infant attunement, infants' spontaneous movements, and infants' achievement of motor milestones. Mothers reported infant temperament. We found infants' smooth and fluent movement character and continual fidgety movements were associated with better attunement in terms of higher maternal sensitivity and non-intrusiveness and higher infant responsiveness and involvement. Unexpectedly, infants' achievement of motor milestones was not significantly associated with mother-infant attunement, and maternal reports of infants' higher soothability were associated with lower maternal sensitivity. The study illustrates the value of including the assessment of infants' spontaneous movements, designed for early detection of neurological deficiencies, in research and in clinical practice with parents and preterm-born infants.

Here, we aimed to track infants' visual developmental steps from a primarily exogenously to more endogenously controlled processing style during their first months of life. In this repeated measures study, 51 infants participated in seven fortnightly assessments at postterm ages of 4-16 weeks. Infants were presented with the same set of static and dynamic paired comparison stimuli in each assessment. Visual behavior was evaluated by a newly introduced scoring scheme. Our results confirmed the suggested visual developmental hierarchy and clearly demonstrated the suitability of our scoring scheme for documenting developmental changes in visual attention during early infancy. Besides the general ontogenetic course of development, we also discuss intra- and interindividual differences which may affect single assessments, and highlight the importance of repeated measurements for reliable evaluation of developmental changes.

J	Tan, ED; Hamlin, JK				Tan, Enda; Hamlin, Jane Kiley			Mechanisms of social evaluation in infancy: A preregistered exploration of infants' eye-movement and pupillary responses to prosocial and antisocial events	INFANCY												Past research shows infants selectively touch and look longer at characters who help versus hinder others (Social evaluation by preverbal infants. Nature, 2007, 450, 557; Three-month-olds show a negativity bias in their social evaluations. Developmental Science, 2010, 13, 923); however, the mechanisms underlying this tendency remain underspecified. The current preregistered experiment approaches this question by examining infants' real-time looking behaviors during prosocial and antisocial events, and exploring how individual infants' looking behaviors correlate with helper preferences. Using eye-tracking, 34 five-month-olds were familiarized with two blocks of the "hill" scenario originally developed by Kuhlmeier et al. (Attribution of dispositional states by 12-month-olds. Psychological Science, 2003, 14, 402), in which a climber tries unsuccessfully to reach the top of a hill and is alternately helped or hindered. Infants' visual preferences were assessed after each block of 6 helping and hindering events by proportional looking time to the helper versus hinderer in an image of the characters side by side. Results showed that, at the group level, infants looked longer at the helper after viewing 12 (but not after viewing 6) helping and hindering videos. Moreover, individual infants' average preference for the helper was predicted by their looking behaviors, particularly those suggestive of an understanding of the climber's unfulfilled goal. These results shed light on how infants process helping/hindering scenarios, and suggest that goal understanding is important for infants' helper preferences.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAR	2022	27	2					255	276		10.1111/infa.12447	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12447		DEC 2021						34873821					WOS:000727106000001

Parental emotion talk with infants in a book-sharing task	INFANCY												While preschoolers consistently produce and use labels for happy and sad emotional states, labels for other emotional states (e.g., disgust) emerge much later in development. One explanation for these differences may lie in how parents first talk about these emotions with their children in infancy and toddlerhood. The current study examined parent talk about different emotions (i.e., happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust) in a book-sharing task with their 12- to 24-month-old infants. Parental talk on each emotion page was coded for both quantity and quality of emotion talk. We found that, rather than labeling or asking questions about disgust emotional states, parents instead elaborated on and asked questions about the context of disgust pictures. In contrast, parents frequently labeled happy and sad emotional states and behaviors. Parental use of causal questions related to infants' productive emotion vocabularies. These different narrative styles may partly explain why older children acquire emotion labels for "happy" and "sad" much earlier than "disgust."

The extent to which infants extract and learn the actual values of the transitional probabilities (TPs) between these objects nevertheless remains an open question. In three experiments providing identical learning conditions but contrasting different types of sequences at test, we examined 8-month-old infants' ability to discriminate between familiar sequences involving high or low values of TPs, and new sequences that involved null TPs. Results showed that infants discriminate between these three types of sequences, supporting the existence of a statistical learning mechanism by which infants extract fine-grained statistical information from a stream of visual stimuli. Interestingly, the expression of this statistical knowledge varied between experiments and specifically depended on the nature of the first two test trials.

Still connecting the dots: An investigation into infants' attentional bias to threat using an eye-tracking task	INFANCY												An attentional bias toward threat has been theorized to be a normative aspect of infants' threat and safety learning, and an indicator of risk for internalizing psychopathology in older populations. To date, only four studies have examined this bias using the dot-probe task in infancy and the findings are mixed. We extended the literature by examining patterns of attention to threat in a culturally and linguistically diverse sample of infants aged 5-11 months old (N = 151) using all measures previously employed in the infant dot-probe literature. Given that an attentional bias toward threat is associated with higher risk of developing anxiety disorders later in life, we also examined how negative affect-an early correlate of later anxiety disorders-is related to attentional bias toward threat in infancy. This study was the first to use a consistent measure of negative affect across the whole sample. An eye-tracking dot-probe task was used to examine attentional bias toward threat (i.e., angry faces) relative to positive (i.e., happy faces) stimuli. Results showed that an attention bias to threat was not characteristic of infants at this age, and negative affect did not moderate the putative relationship between attention and emotional faces (angry, happy). These findings therefore suggest that attention biases to socio-emotional threat may not have emerged by 11 months old.

J	DeJesus, JM; Venkatesh, S				DeJesus, Jasmine M.; Venkatesh, Shruthi			Does social modeling increase infants' willingness to accept unfamiliar foods?	INFANCY												Despite a rich knowledge base about infants' social learning and studies observing social referencing in other species in food contexts, we know surprisingly little about social learning about food among human infants. This gap in the literature is particularly surprising considering that feeding unfamiliar foods to infants is a very common experience as infants begin to eat solid foods. The present study examines whether parental social modeling influences infants' willingness to accept unfamiliar foods. In two Zoom sessions, parents will be asked to feed unfamiliar foods to their 6- to 24-month-old infants (different unfamiliar foods in each session). In both sessions, infants' food acceptance and rejection will be measured. In the first session, parents will be asked to do what they would typically do; spontaneous social modeling will be recorded. In the second session, parents will be instructed to model eating the unfamiliar food. We will examine associations between infants' willingness to eat unfamiliar foods, parent social modeling, and extant parent and infant characteristics.

In this pilot study, we examined whether music that expresses contrasting emotions (happy vs. sad) was associated with toddlers' helpfulness. Seventy-five 18-month-olds from Hong Kong China were randomly assigned to engage with music with an experimenter in one of two conditions: happy- or sad-sounding music. After the musical engagement task, toddlers from both conditions completed the same set of helping tasks. For instrumental (action-based) helping, toddlers were significantly more helpful after engaging with happy-sounding music than with sad-sounding music. Our initial findings suggest that cues linked to happy- and sad-sounding music influence toddlers' prosocial responses.

Replacing eye trackers in ongoing studies: A comparison of eye-tracking data quality between the Tobii Pro TX300 and the Tobii Pro Spectrum	INFANCY												The Tobii Pro TX300 is a popular eye tracker in developmental eye-tracking research, yet it is no longer manufactured. If a TX300 breaks down, it may have to be replaced. The data quality of the replacement eye tracker may differ from that of the TX300, which may affect the experimental outcome measures. This is problematic for longitudinal and multi-site studies, and for researchers replacing eye trackers between studies. We, therefore, ask how the TX300 and its successor, the Tobii Pro Spectrum, compare in terms of eye-tracking data quality. Data quality-operationalized through precision, accuracy, and data loss-was compared between eye trackers for three age groups (around 5-months, 10-months, and 3-years). Precision was better for all gaze position signals obtained with the Spectrum in comparison to the TX300. Accuracy of the Spectrum was higher for the 5-month-old and 10-month-old children. For the three-year-old children, accuracy was similar across both eye trackers. Gaze position signals from the Spectrum exhibited lower proportions of data loss, and the duration of the data loss periods tended to be shorter. In conclusion, the Spectrum produces gaze position signals with higher data quality, especially for the younger infants. Implications for data analysis are discussed.					; Niehorster, Diederick Christian/E-9325-2010	de Kloe, Yentl/0000-0001-5950-4973; Nystrom, Marcus/0000-0002-2089-9012; Niehorster, Diederick Christian/0000-0002-4672-8756													1525-0008	1532-7078				JAN	2022	27	1					25	45		10.1111/infa.12441	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12441		OCT 2021						34687142					WOS:000710002900001

Jacob; Mesman, Judi			Using video observation in the family context: The association between camera-related behaviors and parental sensitivity	INFANCY												Research on parental sensitivity often relies on video observation of parent-infant dyads. However, to date, no study has assessed both infants' and parents' interactions with the camera, and how this relates to parental sensitivity levels. This exploratory study micro-coded camera-related behaviors (CRB) by 4-month olds and their mothers and fathers on a 1-s time base, and examined the associations between those behaviors and parental sensitivity in 75 Dutch families. While parents' CRB made up only 0.8% of total interaction time, infants' made up 12%. Multi-level time-series analyses showed that infants' CRB predicted mothers'. Infants' CRB predicted fathers' CRB, and vice versa. Maternal sensitivity was significantly lower when children looked at the camera for over one-third of total interaction time (Cohen's d = 1.26). These findings indicate further research is required to better understand how video observation might threaten ecological validity.					Mesman, Judi/P-2846-2015	Flameling, L.

Exploring developmental changes in infant anticipation and perceptual processing: EEG responses to tactile stimulation	INFANCY												There is an increasing interest in alpha-range rhythms in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in relation to perceptual and attentional processes. The infant mu rhythm has been extensively studied in the context of linkages between action observation and action production in infancy, but less is known about the mu rhythm in relation to cross-modal processes involving somatosensation. We investigated differences in mu responses to cued vibrotactile stimulation of the hand in two age groups of infants: From 6 to 7 months and 13 to 14 months. We were also interested in anticipatory neural responses in the alpha frequency range prior to tactile stimulation. Tactile stimulation of infants' left or right hand was preceded by an audiovisual cue signaling which hand would be stimulated. In response to the tactile stimulus, infants demonstrated significant mu desynchronization over the central areas contralateral to the hand stimulated, with higher mu peak frequency and greater contralateral mu desynchronization for older infants. Prior to the tactile stimulus, both age groups showed significant bilateral alpha desynchronization over frontocentral sites, which may be indicative of generalized anticipation of an upcoming stimulus. The findings highlight the potential of examining the sensorimotor mu rhythm in the context of infant attentional development.

Associations between acoustic features of maternal speech and infants' emotion regulation following a social stressor	INFANCY												Caregiver voices may provide cues to mobilize or calm infants. This study examined whether maternal prosody predicted changes in infants' biobehavioral state after the still face, a stressor in which the mother withdraws and reinstates social engagement. Ninety-four dyads participated in the study (infant age 4-8 months). Infants' heart rate and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (measuring cardiac vagal tone) were derived from an electrocardiogram (ECG). Infants' behavioral distress was measured by negative vocalizations, facial expressions, and gaze aversion. Mothers' vocalizations were measured via a composite of spectral analysis and spectro-temporal modulation using a two-dimensional fast Fourier transformation of the audio spectrogram. High values on the maternal prosody composite were associated with decreases in infants' heart rate (beta = -.26, 95% CI: [-0.46, -0.05]) and behavioral distress (beta = -.23, 95% CI: [-0.42, -0.03]), and increases in cardiac vagal tone in infants whose vagal tone was low during the stressor (1 SD below mean beta = .39, 95% CI: [0.06, 0.73]). High infant heart rate predicted increases in the maternal prosody composite (beta = .18, 95% CI: [0.03, 0.33]). These results suggest specific vocal acoustic features of speech that are relevant for regulating infants' biobehavioral state and demonstrate mother-infant bi-directional dynamics.					daSilva, Elizabeth/AAT-4989-2021; Bertenthal, Bennett/GLN-6211-2022	Porges, Stephen/0000-0002-7293-2005; Dasilva, Elizabeth/0000-0002-2104-178X													1525-0008	1532-7078				JAN	2022	27	1					135	158		10.1111/infa.12440	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12440		OCT 2021						34618391					WOS:000704328300001

However, the association between infants' regulatory behavior patterns and their later attachment organization is understudied in the preterm population. We addressed this gap by utilizing a Portuguese sample of 202 mother-infant dyads. Specifically, we compared the regulatory behavior patterns of 74 infants born moderate-to-late preterm (MLPT, 32-36 GW) to those of 128 infants born full-term (FT, 37-42 GW) and evaluated the associations of these regulatory patterns with later attachment. Infants' regulatory behavior patterns (Social-Positive Oriented, Distressed-Inconsolable, or Self-Comfort Oriented) were evaluated in the Face-to-Face-Still-Face paradigm at 3 months, and their attachment organization (secure, insecure-avoidant, or insecure-ambivalent) was evaluated in the Strange Situation at 12 months corrected age. In both samples, the Social-Positive-Oriented regulatory pattern was associated with secure attachment; the Distressed-Inconsolable pattern with insecure-ambivalent attachment; and the Self-Comfort-Oriented pattern with insecure-avoidant attachment. However, compared to FT infants, infants born MLPT were more likely to exhibit a Self-Comfort-Oriented pattern and avoidant attachment. Most perinatal and demographic variables were not related to infant outcomes. However, infants with a higher 1-min Apgar were more likely to exhibit the Social-Positive-Oriented regulatory pattern and secure attachment.

We tested infants to determine if they would also change their vocal behavior in response to contingent feedback, which lacks the social, emotional, and auditory modeling typical of parent-child interaction. Here, we show that in a single five-minute session infants increase the rate of their vocalizations in order to control the appearance of colorful shapes on an iPad screen. This is the first experimental study to demonstrate that infants can rapidly learn to increase their vocalizations, when given positive reinforcement with no social element. This work sets the foundations for future studies into the causal relationship between the number of early vocalizations and the onset of words. In addition, there are potential clinical applications for reinforcing vocal practice in infant populations who are at risk for poor language skills.

A hierarchical Bayesian robust regression model of 92 separate effect sizes extracted from 24 studies indicates a moderate effect size in a positive direction (0.35, CI [0.21: 0.50]). This result suggests that infants possess a robust ability to detect audio-visual congruence for speech. Moderator analyses, moreover, suggest that infants' audio-visual matching ability for speech emerges at an early point in the process of language acquisition and remains stable for both native and non-native speech throughout early development. A sensitivity analysis of the meta-analytic data, however, indicates that a moderate publication bias for significant results could shift the lower credible interval to include null effects. Based on these findings, we outline recommendations for new lines of enquiry and suggest ways to improve the replicability of results in future investigations.					; Fusaroli, Riccardo/A-8892-2010	Cox, Christopher/0000-0003-4076-581X; Fusaroli, Riccardo/0000-0003-4775-5219													1525-0008	1532-7078				JAN	2022	27	1					67	96		10.1111/infa.12436	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12436		SEP 2021						34542230					WOS:000697450300001

The paradigms revealing these behaviors have become cornerstones of research on preverbal cognition. However, little is known about whether these canonical behaviors are observed outside laboratory settings. Here, we describe a series of online protocols that replicate classic laboratory findings, detailing our methods throughout. In Experiment 1a, 15-month-old infants (N = 24) looked longer at an online support event culminating in an Unexpected outcome (i.e., appearing to defy gravity) than an Expected outcome. Infants did not, however, show the same success with an online solidity event. In Experiment 1b, 15-month-old infants (N = 24) showed surprise-induced learning following online events-they were better able to learn a novel object's label when the object had behaved unexpectedly compared to when it behaved expectedly. Finally, in Experiment 2, 16-month-old infants (N = 20) who heard a valenced utterance ("Yum!") showed preferential looking to the object most likely to have generated that utterance. Together, these results suggest that, with some adjustments, online testing is a feasible and promising approach for infant cognition research.

When dogs meow: An electrophysiological study of lexical-semantic processing in toddlers	INFANCY												The goal of this study was to investigate lexical-semantic processing at an early phase of language development. Adults often communicate with children using infant-directed speech that typically involves lexical and syntactic modifications such as onomatopoeias (Soderstrom, 2007). Here, we asked how and when children start to show an advantage for processing conventional linguistic forms, such as common nouns, and consequently decreasing sensitivity to onomatopoeias. We recorded event-related brain potentials in children of two age groups (16-21 months and 24-31 months) and in an adult control group during the presentation of four conditions in which either common nouns or onomatopoeias were presented auditorily followed by a picture of an either congruent or incongruent object. We focused on the N400 effect, a more negative ERP response to incongruent compared with congruent semantic relations. The younger children showed an N400 effect only for onomatopoeic words, while the older children showed an N400 effect only for common nouns. The adults showed N400 effects for onomatopoeia and nouns. These different N400 effects suggest that onomatopoeia and common nouns are differently organized in children's semantic memory and that the acquisition of linguistic abilities affects and modifies semantic processing of different lexical information.

Infants can discriminate languages when hearing long passages, but language switches often occur on short time scales with few cues to language identity. As bilingual infants begin learning sequences of sounds and words, how do they detect the dynamics of two languages? In two studies using the head-turn preference procedure, we investigated whether infants (n = 44) can discriminate languages at the level of individual words. In Study 1, bilingual and monolingual 8- to 12-month-olds were tested on their detection of single-word language switching in lists of words (e.g., "dog horizontal ellipsis lait [fr. milk]"). In Study 2, they were tested on language switching within sentences (e.g., "Do you like the lait?"). We found that infants were unable to detect language switching in lists of words, but the results were inconclusive about infants' ability to detect language switching within sentences. No differences were observed between bilinguals and monolinguals. Given that bilingual proficiency eventually requires detection of sound sequences across two languages, more research will be needed to conclusively understand when and how this skill emerges.

However, bilingual children are faced with a different cognitive challenge-they need to learn to associate two labels with one object. In the present study, we compared bilingual and monolingual 24-month-olds' performance on a challenging and semi-naturalistic forced-choice referent selection task and retention test. Overall, both language groups performed similarly on referent selection but differed on retention.

The 31-item Early Executive Functions Questionnaire (EEFQ) complements temperament measures by targeting cognitive and regulatory capabilities. Exploratory Factor Analysis (n = 486 8- to 30-month-olds) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (n = 317 9- to 30-month-olds) indicate Inhibitory Control, Flexibility, and Working Memory items load onto a common "Cognitive Executive Function (CEF)" factor, while Regulation items do not. The CEF factor shows strong factorial measurement invariance for sex, and partial strong factorial measurement invariance for age. CEF and Regulation scores show limited floor and ceiling effects, good internal consistency, short-term stability, and convergent validity with carer-report measures of attentional control. The EEFQ is sensitive to developmental change. Results indicate that the widely overlooked period between late infancy and early toddlerhood may be a sensitive period for EF development. The low-resource demands of the EEFQ afford the possibility to study emergent EFs at scale; opening up new opportunities in basic developmental and intervention research.

Linguistic and developmental influences on superordinate facial configuration categorization in infancy	INFANCY												Humans perceive emotions in terms of categories, such as "happiness," "sadness," and "anger." To learn these complex conceptual emotion categories, humans must first be able to perceive regularities in expressive behaviors (e.g., facial configurations) across individuals. Recent research suggests that infants spontaneously form "basic-level" categories of facial configurations (e.g., happy vs. fear), but not "superordinate" categories of facial configurations (e.g., positive vs. negative). The current studies further explore how infant age and language impact superordinate categorization of facial configurations associated with different negative emotions. Across all experiments, infants were habituated to one person displaying facial configurations associated with anger and disgust. While 10-month-olds formed a category of person identity (Experiment 1), 14-month-olds formed a category that included negative facial configurations displayed by the same person (Experiment 2). However, neither age formed the hypothesized superordinate category of negative valence. When a verbal label ("toma") was added to each of the habituation events (Experiment 3), 10-month-olds formed a category similar to 14-month-olds in Experiment 2. These findings intersect a larger conversation about the nature and development of children's emotion categories and highlight the importance of considering developmental processes, such as language learning and attentional/memory development, in the design and interpretation of infant categorization studies.

J	Korja, R; McMahon, C				Korja, Riikka; McMahon, Catherine			Maternal prenatal mood problems and lower maternal emotional availability associated with lower quality of child's emotional availability and higher negative affect during still-face procedure	INFANCY												Our aim was to study the effects of maternal perinatal mood and maternal emotional availability on child emotional availability and negative affect during the still-face procedure (SFP). The sample included 214 women who participated in a prospective study. We assessed maternal mood problems using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and PRAQ questionnaire during pregnancy and using STAI and EPDS questionnaires during pregnancy and at 6 months after delivery. Maternal and child emotional availability were studied using the Emotional Availability Scales during the SFP at 6 months. We observed and quantified child's negative affect during SFP episodes. We found that mothers with maternal mood problems (anxiety and/or depression) during pregnancy, but not postnatally, showed less optimal maternal structuring during the SFP, and the children showed lower involvement and responsiveness during interactions with their mothers. Furthermore, lower maternal emotional availability was related to the child's higher negative affect during the SFP. Our findings underline the independent roles of both prenatal stress exposure and maternal caregiving behavior in a child's socioemotional development.					; Korja, Riikka/M-9344-2015	McMahon, Catherine/0000-0002-3753-006X; Korja, Riikka/0000-0002-6833-1565													1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV	2021	26	6					901	919		10.1111/infa.12428	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12428		AUG 2021						34370394					WOS:000683057100001

Clinically depressed and typically developing mother-infant dyads: Domain base rates and correspondences, relationship contingencies and attunement	INFANCY												Maternal depression is associated with adverse outcomes in infants. Unfavorable parenting practices likely constitute one pathway of risk transmission from mother to infant, but definitional and methodological variation in the extant literature precludes a comprehensive or conclusive understanding of potential underlying mechanisms. This study aimed to illuminate the role of maternal clinical depression in mother-infant interaction by turning a microanalytic lens on four substantive relationship issues: base rates, correspondences, contingencies, and attunement. Several maternal parenting practices (aggregated into social, didactic, and language domains) and several infant behaviors (aggregated into social, exploration, and non-distress vocalization domains) were microcoded to 0.10 s from naturalistic hour long interactions of clinically depressed mothers (n = 60) and matched non-depressed controls (n = 60) with their 5-month-olds. Clinically depressed mothers spontaneously engaged their infants less didactically, were less contingent to their infants in social, didactic, and language domains, and were less attuned with their infants than were non-depressed mothers. Infants of clinically depressed mothers vocalized non-distress less than infants of non-depressed mothers. These differences unveil key disadvantages in the everyday lived experiences of infants of clinically depressed mothers. The findings advance understanding of maternal depression and its effects and have implications for identifying infants at risk on account of their mothers' clinical depression.

One such cue infants might use is the language-specific phonotactics to track legal combinations and positions of segments within a word. Studies have demonstrated that, when tested across statistically high and low phonotactics, infants repeatedly reject the low-frequency wordforms. We explore whether the capacity to access low-frequency phonotactic combinations is available at 9 months when pre-exposed to wordforms containing statistically low combinations of segments. Using a modified head-turn procedure, one group of infants was presented with nonwords with low-frequency complex onsets (dr-), and another group was presented with zero-frequency onset nonwords (dl-). Following pre-exposure and familiarization, infants were then tested on their ability to segment nonwords that contained either the low- or the zero-frequency onsets. Only infants in the low-frequency condition were successful at the task, suggesting some experience with these onsets supports segmentation.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				SEP	2021	26	5					745	755		10.1111/infa.12423	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12423		JUL 2021						34297896					WOS:000676093600001
J	Creaghe, N; Quinn, S; Kidd, E				Creaghe, Noelie; Quinn, Sara; Kidd, Evan			Symbolic play provides a fertile context for language development	INFANCY												In this study, we test the hypothesis that symbolic play represents a fertile context for language acquisition because its inherent ambiguity elicits communicative behaviors that positively influence development. Infant-caregiver dyads (N = 54) participated in two 20-minute play sessions six months apart (Time 1 = 18 months, Time 2 = 24 months). During each session, the dyads played with two sets of toys that elicited either symbolic or functional play. The sessions were transcribed and coded for several features of dyadic interaction and language; infants' linguistic proficiency was measured via parental report. The two contexts elicited different communicative and linguistic behaviors. Notably, the symbolic play condition resulted in significantly greater conversational turn-taking than functional play, and also resulted in the greater use of questions and mimetics in infant-directed speech (IDS). In contrast, caregivers used more imperative clauses in functional play. Correlational and regression analyses showed that frequent properties of symbolic play (i.e., turn-taking, yes-no questions, mimetics) were positively related to infants' language proficiency, whereas frequent features of functional play (i.e., imperatives in IDS) were negatively related. The results provide evidence supporting the hypothesis that symbolic play is a fertile context for language development, driven by the need to negotiate meaning.

Infants scan static and dynamic facial expressions differently	INFANCY												Despite being inherently dynamic phenomena, much of our understanding of how infants attend and scan facial expressions is based on static face stimuli. Here we investigate how six-, nine-, and twelve-month infants allocate their visual attention toward dynamic-interactive videos of the six basic emotional expressions, and compare their responses with static images of the same stimuli. We find infants show clear differences in how they attend and scan dynamic and static expressions, looking longer toward the dynamic-face and lower-face regions. Infants across all age groups show differential interest in expressions, and show precise scanning of regions "diagnostic" for emotion recognition. These data also indicate that infants' attention toward dynamic expressions develops over the first year of life, including relative increases in interest and scanning precision toward some negative facial expressions (e.g., anger, fear, and disgust).

Children with spastic cerebral palsy have impaired selective leg joint movement, which contributes to lifelong walking limitations. We investigated whether infants born PT generated more selective hip-knee joint movement (e.g., hip flexes as knee extends) while participating in a scaffolded mobile task. Infants born PT and infants born full-term (FT) at 4 months corrected age participated in a scaffolded mobile task for 2-3 consecutive days. The scaffolded mobile task required infants to raise their legs vertically over a virtual threshold. Three threshold heights (low, middle, and high) were used to test whether the middle and high heights encourage infants to move their legs more selectively. Fifteen infants born FT learned the task and showed more selective hip-knee movement at each of the three threshold heights on the day that they learned, compared with their baseline spontaneous kicking. Thirteen infants born PT learned the task and showed more selective hip-knee movement on their learning day, but only when the middle and high thresholds were used. The results show that the scaffolded mobile task effectively encouraged infants to generate more selective hip-knee joint movement.

Reliable, efficient, and sensitive tools are needed to identify young children who may benefit from further assessment and support. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), offers a brief, convenient means of screening for early problems, however, it lacks psychometric validation in infants. The aim of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of the SDQ in children aged 12-24 months. Ninety-three participants, with children aged 12-24 months, completed the SDQ and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) online. Concurrent validity of the SDQ was assessed through comparison with the CBCL. The results demonstrated that key subscales of the SDQ and CBCL were significantly correlated (r range= -.19 to -.57). Key SDQ subscales showed moderate reliability (Cronbach's alpha range = .38-.79, mean inter-item correlation range = .06-.43). The SDQ shows promising reliability and validity as a measure for rating the behavior of 12-24-months-old children, particularly for externalizing symptoms. Further research is needed to assess its predictive utility.					; Ramchandani, Paul/O-5340-2014	Rosan, Camilla/0000-0002-0132-0618; Ramchandani, Paul/0000-0003-3646-2410; Patel, Jinal/0000-0001-5399-8773; Iles, Jane/0000-0002-3602-9898													1525-0008	1532-7078				SEP	2021	26	5					724	734		10.1111/infa.12425	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12425		JUL 2021						34288359					WOS:000674852500001

Emerging coherence and relations to communication among executive function tasks in toddlers: Evidence from a Latin American sample	INFANCY												Recent work within early executive function (EF) seems to suggest that toddlers show distinct patterns of development, involving poorly correlated performance across EF tasks and significant improvements over relatively short periods of time. The present study sought to extend these findings by investigating evidence for these patterns in toddlers and the existence of more traditional patterns of EF (e.g., correlations between tasks, links to language) when using the same tasks in a novel Latin American sample. Eighty toddlers (18-24 months) and sixty young preschoolers (30-36) months completed a battery of EF tasks, early social communication, and receptive and expressive language measures. Results indicated that toddlers showed similar distinct patterns of development (i.e., few relations between tasks and links to responding to joint attention), but by early preschool a more cohesive EF and links to language were present. Further, work demonstrated significant age (older children outperformed younger children), gender (girls outperformed boys), and socioeconomic differences (satisfied basic needs outperformed unsatisfied basic needs, but only on the snack delay). This work provides evidence for patterns of emerging EF development within this novel cultural sample (and evidence for group differences) that may be supported by communicative and representational development.

Contradictory findings of previous research indicate that additional factors play a role in this process. The current study investigated whether five-month-old infants show differential brain activity between emotional faces. Furthermore, we explored the relation between emotional face processing and (I) stimulus characteristics, specifically the spatial frequency content, and (II) parent, child, and dyadic qualities of interaction characteristics. Face-sensitive components (i.e., N290, P400, Nc) in response to neutral and fearful faces that contained only lower or higher spatial frequencies were assessed. Quality of parent-child interaction was assessed with the Manchester Assessment of Caregiver Infant Interaction (MACI). The results show that, as a full group, none of the components differed between emotional expressions. However, when splitting the group based on median MACI scores, infants who showed high quality of interaction (i.e., more attentiveness to caregiver, positive and negative affect, and liveliness) processed emotions differently, whereas infants who showed low quality did not. These results indicate that a sub-group of infants show differential emotional face processing at 5 months of age, which seem to relate to quality of their behavior during the parent-child interaction.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV	2021	26	6					811	830		10.1111/infa.12420	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12420		JUL 2021						34237191					WOS:000670705900001

In the current study, the behavior of 25 infants was analyzed on the Real Cliff/Water Cliff apparatus using a longitudinal study design.

Infants avoided falling on both cliffs when tested as experienced crawlers and their behavior was not different when tested as novice or experienced walkers. These findings confirmed the effect of crawling experience on crawling and walking infants' avoidance of falls from heights and into water and the transfer of perceptual learning from crawling to walking postures.

A parent gesture intervention as a means to increase parent declarative pointing and child vocabulary	INFANCY												This study examined whether a brief parent gesture training resulted in a change in the communicative intent of pointing gestures used by parents of infants from age 10-12 months and whether specific types of points (declarative vs. imperative) were more or less likely to predict later child language skill at 18 months. Compared to parents who were randomized to the control group, parents in the intervention group produced significantly more declarative pointing gestures as a result of the intervention. Moreover, parents' use of declarative points at 12 months was predictive of later child vocabulary comprehension at 18 months. These findings suggest that a short-term parent training can have important effects on the communicative intentions conveyed through gesture which predict vocabulary development.

Development and validation of the Mindful Parenting in Infancy Scale (MPIS)	INFANCY												Although mindfulness in parenting has been recognized as important for some time, there is a dearth of measurement tools, especially for caregivers of infants. Two studies were conducted: (1) developing and providing an initial psychometric evaluation of the Mindful Parenting in Infancy Scale (MPIS) and (2) reproducing initial findings with an independent sample of infants and caregivers. In Study 1, 37 caregivers of infants (3-12 months of age) responded to MPIS, providing indicators of parenting stress and infant temperament. Study 2 caregivers (N = 57) responded to identical measures, with infant electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded during the Still Face Procedure, along with a baseline condition. Study 1 results indicated good internal consistency, with Study 2 providing additional support for reliability. Correlations with parenting stress markers were also significant across both investigations, indicative of greater stress with lower levels of mindfulness. A number of correlations with temperament scores were also significant, and in the hypothesized direction, across both studies. Importantly, the MPIS score was predictive of infant frontal EEG asymmetry in a path model examined in the context of Study 2. Thus, the present investigation provides support for MPIS as a promising brief measurement tool based on results obtained with two independent samples.

The present study investigated (1) what emotions infants of 1-2 years old are capable of pretending and (2) the possible role of language and symbolic play in the ability to pretend emotions. The sample included 69 infants aged 18 to 31 months and their parents. Infants were administrated the Test of Pretend Play, and their parents responded to the MacArthur-Bates CDI-II inventory, part of the MacArthur-Bates CDI-I, and a questionnaire about the expression of pretend emotions. Results suggest that very young children simulate emotions. Furthermore, children's simulation of emotions was related to both symbolic play and language. Specifically, the ability to label emotions was linked to the ability to simulate them.

Emotion regulation from infancy to toddlerhood: Individual and group trajectories of full-term and very-low-birthweight preterm infants	INFANCY												Adaptive emotion regulation begins with infants operating jointly with their parents to regulate their emotions, which fosters the development of independent regulation. Little is known about when or how this transition occurs, or the impact of factors such as parental availability or premature birth status. The current study examined the use of self-soothing, attentional distraction, and dyadic regulation in full-term and healthy very-low-birthweight (VLBW) preterm infant-mother dyads at 5 1/2, 12, and 18 months of age. At 5 1/2 months, dyads participated in the Still-Face procedure. At 12 and 18 months, dyads participated in two free-play interactions, a puzzle task, and an interference task. Emotion regulation behaviors were coded using two systematic, observational systems. Results indicated that infants used less self-soothing and attentional distraction and more dyadic regulation as they aged. Increased use of self-soothing at earlier ages predicted increased use of dyadic regulation at subsequent ages. Toddlers used more independent, attention-seeking, and escape behavior during periods of maternal unavailability. There were no significant differences between full-term and VLBW/preterm toddlers' emotion regulation behaviors. Results from the current study contribute to the understanding of normative development of emotion regulation and the risk associated with prematurity.

Longitudinal transactional relations among young children's defiance and committed compliance and maternal assertive control	INFANCY												The main goal of this study was to more closely understand the direction of relations between maternal behavior and young children's defiance and committed compliance. We examined 256 mother-child dyads to explore developmental transactional relations between maternal assertive control, children's committed compliance, and children's defiance at 18 (T1), 30 (T2), and 42 (T3) months of age. After controlling for maternal gentle control, SES, and child sex, results showed parent effects for children's committed compliance, such that T1 maternal assertive control negatively predicted T3 committed compliance. Furthermore, toddlers' behavior predicted T3 parenting; that is, toddlers' T1 defiance positively predicted T3 maternal assertive control. Results of the present study indicate relatively long-term prediction (to 42 months) from both parent and child behaviors at 18 months of age, and the findings have implications for understanding the bidirectional and complex processes that account for young children's adaptive and maladaptive behaviors.

J	Fawcett, C; Kreutz, G				Fawcett, Christine; Kreutz, Gunter			Twelve-month-old infants' physiological responses to music are affected by others' positive and negative reactions	INFANCY												Infants show remarkable skills for processing music in the first year of life. Such skills are believed to foster social and communicative development, yet little is known about how infants' own preferences for music develop and whether social information plays a role. Here, we investigate whether the reactions of another person influence infants' responses to music. Specifically, 12-month-olds (N = 33) saw an actor react positively or negatively after listening to clips of instrumental music. Arousal (measured via pupil dilation) and attention (measured via looking time) were assessed when infants later heard the clips without the actor visible. Results showed greater pupil dilation when listening to music clips that had previously been reacted to negatively than those that had been reacted to positively (Exp. 1). This effect was not replicated when a similar, rather than identical, clip from the piece of music was used in the test phase (Exp. 2, N = 35 12-month-olds). There were no effects of the actor's positive or negative reaction on looking time. Together, our findings suggest that infants are sensitive to others' positive and negative reactions not only for concrete objects, such as food or toys, but also for more abstract stimuli including music.

J	Crivello, C; Grossman, S; Poulin-Dubois, D				Crivello, Cristina; Grossman, Shawna; Poulin-Dubois, Diane			Specifying links between infants' theory of mind, associative learning, and selective trust	INFANCY												The psychological mechanisms underlying infants' selective social learning are currently a subject of controversy. The main goal of the present study was to contribute data to this debate by investigating whether domain-specific or domain-general abilities guide infants' selectivity. Eighteen-month-olds observed a reliable and an unreliable speaker, and then completed a forced-choice word learning paradigm, two theory of mind tasks, and an associative learning task. Results revealed that infants showed sensitivity to the verbal competence of the speaker. Additionally, infants with superior knowledge inference abilities were less likely to learn from the unreliable speaker. No link was observed between selective social learning and associative learning skills. These results replicate and extend previous findings demonstrating that socio-cognitive abilities are linked to infants' selective social learning.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				SEP	2021	26	5					664	685		10.1111/infa.12407	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12407		MAY 2021						34043285					WOS:000655112300001

In the current study, we examined 9- to 12-month-old infants' understanding of the categories "male" and "female" by testing for gender matching in voices or faces with biological motion depicted in point light displays (PLDs). Infants did not show voice-PLD gender matching spontaneously (Experiment 1) or after "training" with gender-matching voice-PLD pairs (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, however, infants were trained with gender-matching face-PLD pairs and we found that patterns of visual attention to top regions of PLD stimuli during training predicted gender matching of female faces and PLDs. Prior to the end of the first postnatal year, therefore, infants may begin to identify gender in human walk motions, and perhaps form social categories from biological motion.

The present study investigates the impact of language familiarity on how French-learning 9- and 12-month-olds recognize own-race faces. In Experiment 1, infants were familiarized with the talking face of a Caucasian bilingual German-French speaker reciting a nursery rhyme in French (native condition) or in German (non-native condition). In the test phase, infants' face recognition was tested by presenting a picture of the speaker's face they were familiarized with, side by side with a novel face. At 9 and 12 months, neither infants in the native condition nor the ones in the non-native condition clearly recognized the speaker's face. In Experiment 2, we familiarized infants with the still picture of the speaker's face, along with the auditory speech stream. This time, both 9- and 12-month-olds recognized the face of the speaker they had been familiarized with, but only if she spoke in their native language. This study shows that at least from 9 months of age, language modulates the way faces are recognized.

J	Denisova, K				Denisova, Kristina			Genetic vulnerability of exposures to antenatal maternal treatments in 1-to 2-month-old infants	INFANCY												The growth and maturation of the nervous system are vulnerable during pregnancy. The impact of antenatal exposures to maternal treatments, in the context of genetic vulnerability of the fetus, on sensorimotor functioning in early infancy remains unexplored. Statistical features of head movements obtained from resting-state sleep fMRI scans are examined in 1- to 2-month-old infants, both those at high risk (HR) for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) due to a biological sibling with ASD and at low risk (LR) (N = 56). In utero exposures include maternal prescription medications (psychotropic Rx: N = 3(HR); N = 5(LR) vs. non-psychotropic Rx: N = 11(HR); N = 9(LR) vs. none: N = 11(HR); N = 16(LR)), psychiatric diagnoses (two or more Dx(2): N = 5(HR); N = 1(LR); one Dx(1): N = 4(HR); N = 5(LR); no Dx: N = 12(HR); N = 19(LR)), infections requiring antibiotics (infection: N = 5(HR); N = 8(LR); no infection: N = 20(HR); N = 22(LR)), or high fever (fever: N = 2(HR); N = 2(LR); no fever: N = 23(HR); N = 27(LR)). Movements with significantly higher variability are detected in infants exposed to psychotropics (e.g., opioid analgesics) and those whose mothers had fever, and this effect is significantly worse for infants at HR for ASD. Movements are significantly less variable in HR infants with non-psychotropic exposures (e.g., antibiotics). Heightened number of psychiatric or mental health conditions is associated with noisier movements in both risk groups. Genetic vulnerability due to in utero exposure to maternal treatments is an important future approach to be advanced in the field of early mind and brain development.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAY	2021	26	3					515	532		10.1111/infa.12398	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12398								33877744					WOS:000641460500010
J	Yu, LR; Myowa, M				Yu, Lira; Myowa, Masako			The early development of tempo adjustment and synchronization during joint drumming: A study of 18-to 42-month-old children	INFANCY												Humans have a unique ability to coordinate their rhythmic behaviors with those of others. Previous studies have demonstrated the early development of spontaneous responses to external rhythmic stimuli; however, there is little evidence regarding when and how infants begin to adjust their movement tempo and synchronize it with that of others, due to the difficulty of detecting continuous rhythmic movements of infants in a laboratory setting. In the current study, we analyzed children in age-groups of 18, 30, and 42 months and adapted a joint-drumming task used by Kirschner and Tomasello (Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 2009, 102, 299-314). The children were enticed to play the drum under four conditions (Speed: 400 or 600 ms ISI; Partner: mother or robot). The results demonstrated that children's ability to adjust their tempo and synchronize with that of 600 ms ISI, which is slower than the spontaneous motor tempo of children at these ages, starts to develop at around 30-month-olds. We also found early evidence of this ability in 18-month-old infants who drummed with their mother. These findings indicate that children's ability for rhythmic coordination develops dynamically between 18 and 30 months of age, and a child's social partner plays an important role in facilitating this development.

Recently, we found that preterm infants showed atypical patterns of social attention compared with term infants. However, it is still unknown how social attention develops and whether the individual differences are associated with developmental outcomes for social communication and language in preterm infants. The social attention of preterm and term infants at 6, 12, and 18 months was investigated using two types of social attention tasks (human-geometric preference task and gaze-following task). The Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) and the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory adapted for Japanese were measured at 18 months. We found that compared with term infants, preterm infants spent less time looking toward dynamic human images and followed another's gaze directions less frequently through 6, 12, and 18 months. Moreover, hierarchical multiple regression analysis revealed that less preference for dynamic human images and gaze-following abilities was associated with high M-CHAT and low language scores in preterm and term infants, respectively. These findings suggest that birth status affects development of social attention through 18 months and individual differences in social attention reflect differences in social communication and language outcomes.

Forty-nine 18-20-month-old Norwegian toddlers performed a touch-based word recognition task, in which they were prompted to identify the labeled target out of two displayed items on a touchscreen tablet. In each trial, the distractor item was either semantically related (e.g., dog-cat) or unrelated (e.g., dog-airplane) to the target. Our results show that toddlers as young as 18 months can engage meaningfully with a tablet-based assessment, with minimal verbal instruction and child-administrator interaction. Toddlers performed better in the semantically unrelated condition than in the related condition, suggesting that their word representations are still semantically coarse at this age. Furthermore, parental reports of comprehension, using the Norwegian version of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories, predicted toddlers' performance, with parent-child agreement stronger in the semantically unrelated condition, indicating that parents declare a word to be known by their child if it is understood at a coarse representational level. This study provides among the earliest evidence that remote data collection in 18-20 month-old toddlers is viable, as comparable results were observed from both in-laboratory and online administration of the touchscreen recognition task.

Yet, caregiver touch remains a relatively understudied topic in human development, possibly due to challenges of measuring this means of interaction. While parental reports (e.g., questionnaires, diaries) are easy to collect, they may be subject to biases and memory limitations. In contrast, observing touch in a short session of parent-child interaction in the lab may not be representative of touch interaction in daily life. In the present study, we compared parent reports (one-off questionnaires and diary) and observation-based methods in a sample of German 6- to 13-month-olds and their primary caregivers (n = 71). In an attempt to characterize touching behaviors across a broad range of contexts, we measured touch both during play and while the parent was engaged in another activity. We found that context affected both the quantity and types of touch used in interaction. Parent-reported touch was moderately associated with touch observed in parent-child interactions and more strongly with touch used during play. We conclude that brief one-off questionnaires are a good indicator of touch in parent-child interaction, yet they may be biased toward representing particular daily activities and particular types of touch.

The impact of parent and child media use on early parent-infant attachment	INFANCY												With the rise in affordability of digital media and mobile devices, children under age 2 on average spend significantly more time with digital media than is recommended. Although concerns have been expressed about how parent and child media use might negatively impact parent-child attachment, there continues to be a scarcity of research on the topic. The current study assessed both the amount and the way in which children (11-26 months) and their parents engage with digital media and the impact on early attachment after controlling for temperament, parent income, parent age, marital status, and access to support. The study utilizes data from a diverse sample: 248 parents of infants completed an attachment q-sort and surveys assessing the amount of media use, parental absorption in media, types of parental mediation, temperament, and demographics. Results showed that for both parent and child, time using digital media and co-viewing was not predictive of attachment insecurity. Parental absorption in media was found to significantly predict attachment insecurity. Greater child TV media use was associated with poorer attachment security when there was limited to no parental active mediation. Active mediation served as a protective factor for attachment while parental absorption in media serves as a risk factor for attachment.

Increased rates of maternal employment post-birth call for greater understanding of the effects of family leave on infant development. This study examined the links between paid leave and toddler language, cognitive, and socioemotional outcomes (24-36 months; N = 328). Results indicate that paid leave was associated with better language outcomes, regardless of socioeconomic status. Additionally, paid leave was correlated with fewer infant behavior problems for mothers with lower levels of educational attainment. Expanding access to policies that support families in need, like paid family leave, may aid in reducing socioeconomic disparities in infant development.

J	Deichmann, F; Ahnert, L				Deichmann, Felix; Ahnert, Lieselotte			The terrible twos: How children cope with frustration and tantrums and the effect of maternal and paternal behaviors	INFANCY												Experimental Frustration Procedures with 158 children (15-39 months) of two-parent families were conducted, with each parent separately involved. We examined diverse characteristics of children's frustration and focused on specific behaviors of how children coped and parents supported them. In addition, external observers measured child attachment security (via Attachment Q Sort) toward the mother and the father during two home visits. Children with high attachment security became frustrated later and for a shorter time, and fathers, as compared to mothers, relieved these frustration patterns and reduced them. Although 22.2% children exhibited intense frustration responses up to tantrums, levels remained unaffected by child gender, but decreased with child age. Time-lag analyses revealed that children's self-comforting behaviors reduced frustration responses only by around 20%, but self-distracting (in younger children) and pretend-playing (in older children) by around 50% and 70%. Of the parent behaviors, demonstrating reduced children's frustration by up to 40% whereas distracting and reframing by around 60% (mothers) and 80% (fathers). In general, mothers tended to protect the child from distress, whereas fathers assisted the child in coping with frustration. However, if mothers soothed and fathers encouraged, children's frustration intensified.

Rule learning transfer across linguistic and visual modalities in 7-month-old infants	INFANCY												Rule learning (RL) refers to infants' ability to extract high-order, repetition-based rules from a sequence of elements and to generalize them to new items. RL has been demonstrated in both the auditory and the visual modality, but no studies have investigated infants' transfer of learning across these two modalities, a process that is fundamental for the development of many complex cognitive skills. Using a visual habituation procedure within a cross-modal RL task, we tested 7-month-old infants' transfer of learning both from speech to vision (auditory-visual-AV-condition) and from vision to speech (visual-auditory-VA-condition). Results showed a transfer of learning in the AV condition, but only for those infants who were able to efficiently extract the rule during the learning (habituation) phase. In contrast, in the VA condition infants provided no evidence of RL. Overall, this study indicates that 7-month-old infants can transfers high-order rules across modalities with an advantage for transferring from speech to vision, and that this ability is constrained by infants' individual differences in the way they process the to-be-learned rules.

Temperament moderates the effects of early deprivation on infant attention	INFANCY												Institutional care has been shown to increase the risk of attention problems in children, but some children are more sensitive to their environment, both for better and for worse. With this in mind, the current study examined the moderating role of temperament (falling reactivity) between early adversity and attention skills. Six- to 15-month-old infants residing in institutions (n = 63) and infants reared by their biological families from low socioeconomic environments (n = 59) were recruited. The infants' attention skills were measured by calculating the length of time they spent looking at toys. The infants' temperaments were measured by a subscale of the Infant Behavior Questionnaire (falling reactivity/rate of recovery from distress). The findings were in line with the differential susceptibility theory. Compared to infants with high levels of falling reactivity, infants with lower levels of falling reactivity had better attention skills if they were in a family group, but they had lower attention skills if they were residing in institutions. The attention skills of the infants who had higher scores for falling reactivity did not appear to be affected by the adverse environment.

With the use of thermal imaging and behavioural analyses, the current study examined the arousal markers accompanying infants' interactions with a familiar and an unfamiliar person. To address the current research question, the mother and a complete stranger interacted with 2 to 3 month-old infants (N= 10, 2 boys)in three different conditions: Neutral, Play, and Compliment. Behavioral analyses showed that overall gaze was longer to the Stranger compared to the Mother independent of condition. Physiological findings showed that skin temperature was significantly higher with the stranger independent of condition. The regions of the face that passed the significance threshold included the maxillary area, the nose, and the forehead. Both behavioral and physiological findings emphasize the ability of the infant to distinguish between a familiar and an unfamiliar person. Most importantly, however thermal imaging has proven to be a promising tool in physiologically differentiating between variable social conditions in very young infants opening up a new experimental portal for identifying healthy physiological development.

This report investigated the predictive value of three dimensions of sensitivity during mother-infant interactions in an effort to gain greater understanding of how specific facets of sensitivity relate to child socioemotional outcomes. Maternal cooperation/attunement (accurate interpretation of infant cues and capacity to adjust the interaction correspondingly), positivity (positive attitude toward the infant), and accessibility/availability (consistent attentiveness) were assessed observationally in 195 mothers of 1-year-old infants. Child socioemotional functioning was assessed using behavioral tasks and maternal and teacher reports when children were 4 years of age. The results revealed that maternal accessibility/availability was predictive of less externalizing behavior, more prosocial behavior (mother- and teacher-reported), and better theory of mind, while maternal positivity predicted effortful control. These results highlight the advantages of a multidimensional assessment in understanding how sensitivity predicts different developmental outcomes.					; Matte-Gagne, Celia/KHZ-3060-2024	Bernier, Annie/0000-0002-2359-9808; Matte-Gagne, Celia/0000-0001-5999-2129													1525-0008	1532-7078				MAR	2021	26	2					238	247		10.1111/infa.12385	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12385								33577118					WOS:000617286000003
J	Csink, V; Mareschal, D; Gliga, T				Csink, Viktoria; Mareschal, Denis; Gliga, Teodora			Does surprise enhance infant memory? Assessing the impact of the encoding context on subsequent object recognition	INFANCY												A discrepancy between what was predicted and what is observed has been linked to increased looking times, changes in brain electrical activity, and increased pupil dilation in infants. These processes associated with heightened attention and readiness to learn might enhance the encoding and memory consolidation of the surprising object, as suggested by both the infant and the adult literature. We therefore investigated whether the presence of surprise during the encoding context enhances subsequent encoding and recognition memory processes for the items that violated infants' expectations. Seventeen-month-olds viewed 20 familiar objects, half of which were labeled correctly, while the other half were mislabeled. Subsequently, infants were presented with a silent recognition memory test where the previously labeled objects appeared along with new images. Pupil dilation was measured, with more dilated pupils indicating (1) surprise during those labeling events where the item was mislabeled and (2) successful retrieval processes during the memory test. Infants responded with more pupil dilation to mislabeling compared to correct labeling. Importantly, despite the presence of a surprise response during mislabeling, infants only differentiated between the previously seen and unseen items at the memory test, offering no evidence that surprise had facilitated the encoding of the mislabeled items.

Relying on formal rhythm classification is problematic for two reasons. First, it is not known to which extent infants' sensitivity to language variation is attributable to rhythm alone, and second, it is not known how infants discriminate languages not classified in any of the putative rhythm classes. Employing a central-fixation preference paradigm with natural stimuli, this study tested whether infants differentially attend to native versus nonnative varieties that differ only in temporal rhythm cues, and both of which are rhythmically unclassified. An analysis of total looking time did not detect any rhythm preferences at any age. First-look duration, arguably more closely reflecting infants' underlying perceptual sensitivities, indicated age-specific preferences for native versus non-native rhythm: 4-month-olds seemed to prefer the native-, and 6-month-olds the non-native language-variety. These findings suggest that infants indeed acquire native rhythm cues rather early, by the 4th month, supporting the theory that rhythm can bootstrap further language development. Our data on infants' processing of rhythmically unclassified languages suggest that formal rhythm classification does not determine infants' ability to discriminate language varieties.

Social interaction targets enhance 13-month-old infants' associative learning	INFANCY												Infants are attentive to third-party interactions, but the underlying mechanisms of this preference remain understudied. This study examined whether 13-month-old infants (N = 32) selectively learn cue-target associations guiding them to videos depicting a social interaction scene. In a visual learning task, two geometrical shapes were repeatedly paired with two kinds of target videos: two adults interacting with one another (social interaction) or the same adults acting individually (non-interactive control). Infants performed faster saccadic latencies and more predictive gaze shifts toward the cued target region during social interaction trials. These findings suggest that social interaction targets can serve as primary reinforcers in an associative learning task, supporting the view that infants find it intrinsically valuable to observe others' interactions.

The present study takes a meta-analytic approach to assess overarching questions on the literature of early word-form recognition. Specifically, we investigated the extent to which there is cross-linguistic evidence for an early recognition lexicon, and how it may be influenced by infant age, language background, and familiarity of the selected stimuli (approximated by parent-reported word knowledge). Our meta-analysis-with open data access on metalab.stanford.edu-was based on 32 experiments in 16 different published or unpublished studies on infants 5-15 months of age. We found an overall significant effect of word-form familiarity on infants' responses. This effect increased with age and was higher for infants learning Romance languages than other languages. We further found that younger, but not older, infants showed higher effect sizes for more familiar word lists. These insights should help researchers plan future studies on word-form recognition.

Maternal dynamic respiratory sinus arrhythmia during toddlers' interactions with novelty	INFANCY												Maternal psychophysiological responses to toddlers' distress to novelty may have important implications for parenting during early childhood that are relevant to children's eventual development of social withdrawal and anxiety. Likely, these responses depend on intrapersonal, interpersonal, and contextual factors. The current study investigated the time course of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) across two laboratory novelty episodes, one low threat and one moderate threat, in 120 mothers of 2-year-old toddlers. Growth models tested context differences in and correlates of dynamic patterns of RSA. Dynamic patterns differed between tasks and according to mothers' perceptions of and distress about toddler shyness. Thus, changes in mothers' RSA across toddlers' interactions with novelty seem to depend on the context as well as how mothers perceive and respond to their toddlers' shyness.

Pupil size provides subtle cues regarding a social interaction partner's arousal states. The current study assessed infants' sensitivity to and preference for differences in pupil size. Specifically, we examined White 14-month-old infants' pupillary responses when viewing own-race and other-race (Asian) eyes with dilating, constricting, and static medium-sized pupils. Our results show that, independent of race, infants' pupils dilated more when viewing eyes with dynamically changing (dilating and constricting) pupils than when viewing eyes with non-changing, static, and medium-sized pupils. We also measured infants' looking preferences, showing that, independent of race, infants preferentially attended to eyes with dilated pupils. Moreover, our results show that infants orient more quickly to pupillary changes in own-race eyes than in other-race eyes. These findings demonstrate that infants detect, but do not mimic, changes in pupil size in others and show a preference for eyes with dilated pupils.

Infants' discrimination of novel vowels in song	INFANCY												When adults speak or sing with infants, they sound differently than in adult communication. Infant-directed (ID) communication helps caregivers to regulate infants' emotions and helps infants to process speech information, at least from ID-speech. However, it is largely unclear whether infants might also process speech information presented in ID-singing. Therefore, we examined whether infants discriminate vowels in ID-singing, as well as potential differences with ID-speech. Using an alternating trial preference procedure, infants aged 4-6 and 8-10 months were tested on their discrimination of an unfamiliar non-native vowel contrast presented in ID-like speech and singing. Relying on models of early speech sound perception, we expected that infants in their first half year of life would discriminate the vowels, in contrast to older infants whose non-native sound perception should deteriorate, at least in ID-like speech. Our results showed that infants of both age groups were able to discriminate the vowels in ID-like singing, while only the younger group discriminated the vowels in ID-like speech. These results show that infants process speech sound information in song from early on. They also hint at diverging perceptual or attentional mechanisms guiding infants' sound processing in ID-speech versus ID-singing toward the end of the first year of life.

Mismatched response predicts behavioral speech discrimination outcomes in infants with hearing loss and normal hearing	INFANCY												Children with hearing loss (HL) remain at risk for poorer language abilities than normal hearing (NH) children despite targeted interventions; reasons for these differences remain unclear. In NH children, research suggests speech discrimination is related to language outcomes, yet we know little about it in children with HL under the age of 2 years. We utilized a vowel contrast, /a-i/, and a consonant-vowel contrast, /ba-da/, to examine speech discrimination in 47 NH infants and 40 infants with HL. At Mean age =3 months, EEG recorded from 11 scalp electrodes was used to compute the time-frequency mismatched response (TF-MMRSE) to the contrasts; at Mean age =9 months, behavioral discrimination was assessed using a head turn task. A machine learning (ML) classifier was used to predict behavioral discrimination when given an arbitrary TF-MMRSE as input, achieving accuracies of 73% for exact classification and 92% for classification within a distance of one class. Linear fits revealed a robust relationship regardless of hearing status or speech contrast. TF-MMRSE responses in the delta (1-3.5 Hz), theta (3.5-8 Hz), and alpha (8-12 Hz) bands explained the most variance in behavioral task performance. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using TF-MMRSE to predict later behavioral speech discrimination.

However, the underlying mechanisms of this relationship are still unclear. The aim of this study was to assess whether it is by mediating the expectation component in Internal Working Models that the quality of attachment style can affect joint attention. At first, 12- to 20-month-old infants were classified into secure and insecure groups using the Strange Situation Procedure. On a following day, using a violation-of-expectation paradigm, infants were habituated to two joint attention videos. Finally, the mean looking time duration of secure and insecure infants were compared with each other between two "divergent attention" and "joint attention" videos. Infants looked longer for divergent attention videos suggesting they did have expectation regarding the appropriate response in triadic interactions. In line with our main hypothesis, secure infants, but not insecure ones, looked longer in the divergent attention situation when an attachment-related context was present, revealing the possible mediating role of "expectations" in the correlation between attachment and joint attention.

Infants' learning of non-adjacent regularities from visual sequences	INFANCY												Tracking adjacent (AD) and non-adjacent (NAD) dependencies in a sequence of elements is critical for the development of many complex abilities, such as language acquisition and social interaction. While learning of AD in infancy is a domain-general ability that is functioning across different domains, infants' processing of NAD has been reported only for speech sequences. Here, we tested 9- to 12- and 13- to 15-month-olds' ability to extract AxB grammars in visual sequences of unfamiliar elements. Infants were habituated to a series of 3-visual arrays following an AxB grammar in which the first element (A) predicted the third element (B), while intervening X elements changed continuously. Following habituation, infants were tested with 3-item arrays in which initial and final positions were switched (novel) or kept consistent with the habituation phase (familiar). Older infants successfully recognized the familiar AxB grammar at test, whereas the younger group showed some sensitivity to extract to NAD, albeit in a less robust form. This finding provides the first evidence that the ability to track NAD is a domain-general ability that is present also in the visual domain and that the sensitivity to such dependencies is related to developmental changes, as demonstrated in the auditory domain.

Infants' abilities to respond to cues for joint attention vary by family socioeconomic status	INFANCY												The influence of socioeconomic variability on language and cognitive development is present from toddlerhood to adolescence and calls for investigating its earliest manifestation. Response to joint attention (RJA) abilities constitute a foundational developmental milestone that are associated with future language, cognitive, and social skills. How aspects of the family home environment shape RJA skills is relatively unknown. We investigated associations between family socioeconomic status (SES) -both parent education and family percentage of the federal poverty level (FPL)- parent depressive and anxiety symptoms and infant RJA performance in a cross-sectional sample of 173 infants aged 8-18 months and their parents from a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds. Results suggest that, correcting for age and receptive language, infants in families with greater economic resources respond to relatively less redundant, more sophisticated cues for joint attention. Although parent depressive and anxiety symptoms are negatively correlated with SES, parent depressive and anxiety symptoms were not associated with infant RJA. These findings provide evidence of SES-related differences in social cognitive development as early as infancy, calling on policymakers to address the inequities in the current socioeconomic landscape of the United States.

While pointing measurements can be easily collected, coded, analyzed, and interpreted, absent responses are often observed particularly when adopting these measures for toddler studies, which leads to an increase of missing data. Although looking responses such as preferential looking can be available as alternative measures in such cases, it is unknown how well looking measurements can be interpreted as equivalent to manual ones. This study aimed to answer this question by investigating how accurately pointing responses (i.e., left or right) could be predicted from concurrent preferential looking. Using pre-existing videos of toddlers aged 18-23 months engaged in an intermodal word comprehension task, we developed models predicting manual from looking responses. Results showed substantial prediction accuracy for both the Simple Majority Vote and Machine Learning-Based classifiers, which indicates that looking responses would be reasonable alternative measures of manual ones. However, the further exploratory analysis revealed that when applying the created models for data of toddlers who did not produce clear pointing responses, the estimation agreement of missing pointing between the models and the human coders slightly dropped. This indicates that looking responses without pointing were qualitatively different from those with pointing. Bridging two measurements in forced-choice tasks would help researchers avoid wasting collected data due to the absence of manual responses and interpret results from different modalities comprehensively.

A longitudinal study of the differential social-cognitive foundations of early prosocial behaviors	INFANCY												A growing body of work has documented the emergence of instrumental helping and sharing in the second year of life; however, less is known about mechanisms that underlie development and production of prosocial behavior. The current study took a longitudinal approach to explore whether the origins of prosocial behaviors can be traced back to foundational social-cognitive capacities emerging in infancy. In a sample of 90 children, longitudinal relations were examined between intention understanding and joint attention measured in infancy (8-12 months) and later instrumental helping and sharing behavior assessed in the toddler years (18-25 months). We expected social-cognitive capacities supporting infants' understanding of others to be positively related to their prosocial behaviors as toddlers. Measured variable path analyses revealed two distinct developmental pathways from infant social cognition to later prosocial behavior: 1) Instrumental helping in the toddler years was positively predicted by intention understanding in infancy; 2) sharing in the toddler years was positively predicted by infants' initiating joint attention. These results lend support to proposals on the multidimensional nature of early prosocial behavior and offer the first longitudinal evidence that the origins of toddlers' prosocial behavior can be traced to social-cognitive capacities emerging in infancy.

In a recent study, Hirsh-Pasek et al. (Psychological Science, 2015; 26: 1071) found that in a low-income sample, fluency and connectedness in exchanges between caregivers and toddlers predicted child language a year later over and above quantity of talk (Hirsh-Pasek et al., Psychological Science, 2015; 26: 1071). Here, we expand upon this study by examining fluency and connectedness in two higher-SES samples. Using data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, we sampled 20 toddlers who had low, average, and high language outcomes at 36 months from each of 2 groups based on income-to-needs ratio (INR; middle and high) and applied new coding to the mother-toddler interaction at 24 months. In the high-INR group, the quality of mother-toddler interaction at 24 months accounted for more variability in language outcomes a year later than did quantity of talk, quality of talk, or sensitive parenting. These results could not be accounted for by child language ability at 24 months. These effects were not found in the middle-INR sample. Our findings suggest that when the quality of interaction, fluency and connectedness, predicts language outcomes, it is a robust relation, but it may not be universal.

However, it behooves a young language learner to simultaneously encode relevant non-verbal cues, for example, by following the direction of their eye gaze. Sensitivity to cues such as eye gaze might be particularly important for bilingual infants, as they encounter less consistency between words and objects than monolingual infants, and do not always have access to the same word-learning heuristics (e.g., mutual exclusivity). In a preregistered study, we tested the hypothesis that bilingual experience would lead to a more pronounced ability to follow another's gaze. We used a gaze-following paradigm developed by Senju and Csibra (Current Biology, 18, 2008, 668) to test a total of 93 6- to 9-month-old and 229 12- to 15-month-old monolingual and bilingual infants, in 11 laboratories located in 8 countries. Monolingual and bilingual infants showed similar gaze-following abilities, and both groups showed age-related improvements in speed, accuracy, frequency, and duration of fixations to congruent objects. Unexpectedly, bilinguals tended to make more frequent fixations to on-screen objects, whether or not they were cued by the actor. These results suggest that gaze sensitivity is a fundamental aspect of development that is robust to variation in language exposure.

Four-month-old infants born FT (n = 18) and PT (n = 18) participated in an infant kick-activated mobile task that was scaffolded to motivate progressively higher kicks. We found the FT group learned the association between their leg movements and mobile activation on the second day, but the PT group learned the association on the third day. Both groups of infants increased the height of their kicks on the day they learned the task, compared with their spontaneous kicking height. These findings suggest that infants born PT have the ability to learn challenging motor tasks, such as kicking high, when participating in a task environment that uses scaffolding.

J	Murillo, E; Casla, M				Murillo, Eva; Casla, Marta			Multimodal representational gestures in the transition to multi-word productions	INFANCY												The aim of this study was to analyze the use of representational gestures from a multimodal point of view in the transition from one-word to multi-word constructions. Twenty-one Spanish-speaking children were observed longitudinally at 18, 21, 24, and 30 months of age. We analyzed the production of deictic, symbolic, and conventional gestures and their coordination with different verbal elements. Moreover, we explored the relationship between gestural multimodal and unimodal productions and independent measures of language development. Results showed that gesture production remains stable in the period studied. Whereas deictic gestures are frequent and mostly multimodal from the beginning, conventional gestures are rare and mainly unimodal. Symbolic gestures are initially unimodal, but between 24 and 30 months of age, this pattern reverses, with more multimodal symbolic gestures than unimodal. In addition, the frequency of multimodal representational gestures at specific ages seems to be positively related to independent measures of vocabulary and morphosyntax development. By contrast, the production of unimodal representational gestures appears negatively related to these measures. Our results suggest that multimodal representational gestures could have a facilitating role in the process of learning to combine meanings for communicative goals.					; Murillo Sanz, Eva/Q-6708-2018	Casla Soler, Marta/0000-0002-4723-773X; Murillo Sanz, Eva/0000-0002-5978-3260													1525-0008	1532-7078				JAN	2021	26	1					104	122		10.1111/infa.12375	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12375		NOV 2020						33230946					WOS:000591811300001

Cognitive function in toddlers with congenital heart disease: The impact of a stimulating home environment	INFANCY												Infants born with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at increased risk of neurodevelopmental difficulties in childhood. The extent to which perioperative factors, cardiac physiology, brain injury severity, socioeconomic status, and home environment influence early neurodevelopment is not clear. Sixty-nine newborns with CHD were recruited from St Thomas' Hospital. Infants underwent presurgical magnetic resonance imaging on a 3-Tesla scanner situated on the neonatal unit. At 22 months, children completed the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-3rd edition and parents completed the cognitively stimulating parenting scale to assess cognitive stimulation at home. Level of maternal education and total annual household income were also collected. Hospital records were reviewed to calculate days on the intensive care unit post-surgery, time on bypass during surgery, and days to corrective or definitive palliative surgical intervention. In the final analysis of 56 infants, higher scores on the cognitively stimulating parenting scale were associated with higher cognitive scores at age 22 months, correcting for gestational age at birth, sex, and maternal education. There were no relationships between outcome scores and clinical factors; socioeconomic status; or brain injury severity. Supporting parents to provide a stimulating home environment for children may promote cognitive development in this high-risk population.					counsell, serena/I-9012-2014; Simpson, John/J-6001-2013; Victor, Suresh/JXN-3539-2024; Nosarti, Chiara/G-5638-2010	rutherford, mary/0000-0003-3361-1337; Kelly, Christopher John/0000-0002-1246-844X; Bonthrone, Alexandra/0000-0001-5487-5564; Counsell, Serena/0000-0002-8033-5673; Victor, Suresh/0000-0002-5314-7626; Nosarti, Chiara/0000-0001-6305-9710; Simpson, John/0000-0002-9773-7441; Chew, Andrew TM/0000-0002-4344-2015; Edwards, Anthony David/0000-0003-4801-7066													1525-0008	1532-7078				JAN	2021	26	1					184	199		10.1111/infa.12376	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12376		NOV 2020						33210418					WOS:000590194300001

Infants distinguish and represent pattern as an object feature from externally generated patterns superimposed on real, 3-dimensional objects' surfaces	INFANCY												As infants form object representations, the patterns viewed on objects' surfaces may be challenging to decipher because these patterns may be created from the surface reflectance of an object (an object property) or from an external source, such as a cast shadow. We tested 7 1/2-month-old infants' use of cues that specify the source of patterns seen on the surfaces of real, 3-dimensional objects to individuate those objects. Results suggest that when forming object representations based on patterns, 71/2-month-olds rely heavily on temporal and depth cues to distinguish patterns inherent to the object from other types of patterns.

Mother-Toddler Cortisol Synchrony Moderates Risk of Early Internalizing Symptoms (vol 23, pg 232, 2018)	INFANCY												Research examining mother-infant interactions indicates a close connection between vocal and gaze behavior. The present longitudinal study examined the development of both intraindividual and dyadic coordination of vocal and gaze behavior in mother-infant dyads at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Mother and infant vocalization and gaze behavior during in-home toy play interactions were coded on a moment-by-moment basis and coordinations (i.e., co-occurrences and sequences of behavior) were compared to randomized baselines in order to determine whether coordinate exceeded chance levels. Infants timed their own vocalizations with gaze to partner's face and inhibited vocalizations during gaze to objects at greater than chance levels across the first year. Mother's displayed above-chance intraindividual coordination of vocalizations and gaze to partner's face and objects. Mothers and infants demonstrated dyadic coordination of vocalizations and gaze at above-chance levels, but developmental change and leading-following dynamics varied based on gaze location (i.e., face vs. object). Results emphasize the importance of examining coordination across communication modalities and of considering bidirectional influences on mother and infant vocal and gaze behavior.

Experience with research paradigms relates to infants' direction of preference	INFANCY												Interpreting and predicting direction of preference in infant research has been a thorny issue for decades. Several factors have been proposed to account for familiarity versus novelty preferences, including age, length of exposure, and task complexity. The current study explores an additional dimension: experience with the experimental paradigm. We reanalyzed the data from 4 experiments on artificial grammar learning in 12-month-old infants run using the head-turn preference procedure (HPP). Participants in these studies varied substantially in their number of laboratory visits. Results show that the number of HPP studies is related to direction of preference: Infants with limited experience with the HPP setting were more likely to show familiarity preferences than infants who had amassed more experience with this paradigm. This evidence has important implications for the interpretation of experimental results: Experience with a given method or, more broadly, with the laboratory environment may affect infants' patterns of preferences.

J	Wang, JJ; Feigenson, L				Wang, Jinjing (Jenny); Feigenson, Lisa			Dynamic changes in numerical acuity in 4-month-old infants	INFANCY												Preverbal infants represent the approximate numerosity of visual and auditory arrays: By 6 months old, they reliably discriminate eight dots or tones from 16 (a 1:2 ratio), but not eight from 12 (a 2:3 ratio). The precision of this approximate number sense improves gradually over childhood and into adulthood. However, less is known about numerical abilities in younger infants, and in particular, whether there is developmental change in the number sense in the first half year of life. Here, in four experiments, we measured numerical precision in 4-month-old infants (N = 128) using a visual habituation task comparable to that in studies of older infants. We found that 4-month-olds exhibited poorer numerical discrimination than the 6-month-olds tested in previous studies, dishabituating to a 1:4 change in numerical ratio, but not a 1:3 change. Like older infants, 4-month-olds' numerical precision improved when they were provided with redundant visual and auditory input; when both visual and auditory information were present, 4-month-olds discriminated a 1:3 but not a 1:2 ratio. These results suggest that Approximate Number System precision develops in early infancy and may be sensitive to intersensory redundancy as early as four months of age.

Variability on irrelevant acoustic dimensions can aid formation of robust categories in infants through adults in tasks such as word learning (e.g., Rost and McMurray, 2009) or speech-sound learning (e.g., Lively et al., 1993). At the same time, variability sometimes overwhelms learners, interfering with learning and processing. Two prior studies (Kuhl & Miller, 1982; Jusczyk, Pisoni, & Mullennix, 1992) found that irrelevant variability sometimes impaired early sound discrimination. We asked whether variability would impair or facilitate discrimination for older infants, comparing 7.5-month-old infants' discrimination of an early acquired native contrast, /p/ vs. /b/ (in the word forms /pIm/ vs. /bIm/), in Experiment 1, with an acoustically subtle, non-native contrast, /n/ vs. /LATIN SMALL LETTER ENG/ (in /nIm/ vs. /LATIN SMALL LETTER ENGIm/), in Experiment 2. Words were spoken by one or four talkers. Infants discriminated the native but not the non-native contrast, and there were no significant effects of talker condition.

In this methodological report, we introduce how concepts from network analysis can be utilized to capture, condense, and extract complex developmental changes in individual behaviors over time. Using infant postural-locomotor development as an example, we demonstrate how network analysis principles can be applied to rich empirical data. We used existing free-play data from 13 infants followed longitudinally as they progressed from sitting to walking. We documented the range of postures adopted during play, how often infants transitioned between postures in their postural networks, and derived parameters of density and centrality. Analysis revealed that posture network density increased after infants learned to crawl and gained crawling experience as one might expect, but density did not further expand with gains in upright locomotion. Certain postures held different roles in the overall posture network displayed by an infant, and these centrality patterns depended on the time period involved. More central postures in the network were not always postures in which infants spent the most time. We discuss how network analysis might be utilized to better understand infant behaviors in other contexts (e.g., problem-solving, interventions, humanoid robotics).

INFANCY												The present article investigated the composition of different joint gaze components used to operationalize various types of coordinated attention between parents and infants and which types of coordinated attention were associated with future vocabulary size. Twenty-five 9-month-old infants and their parents wore head-mounted eye trackers as they played with objects together. With high-density gaze data, a variety of coordinated attention bout types were quantitatively measured by combining different gaze components, such as mutual gaze, joint object looks, face looks, and triadic gaze patterns. The key components of coordinated attention that were associated with vocabulary size at 12 and 15 months included the simultaneous combination of parent triadic gaze and infant object looking. The results from this article are discussed in terms of the importance of parent attentional monitoring and infant sustained attention for language development.

J	Geraci, A				Geraci, Alessandra			How do toddlers evaluate defensive actions toward third parties?	INFANCY												Defensive behavior is a central aspect of social life and provides benefits to the self and others. Recent evidence reveals that infants evaluate third parties' prosocial and antisocial actions. Three experiments were carried out to assess toddlers' reactions to defensive and non-defensive events (N = 54). In two experiments, infants' looking times and manual choices provided converging evidence that 20-month-olds understand and evaluate defensive actions, by showing that they prefer the defensive puppet over the non-defensive puppet and that they reason on the bystander puppet's disposition. In the third experiment, toddlers rewarded the defensive puppet rather than the non-defensive puppet, revealing how their evaluations guided awarding behaviors of defensive actions toward the third party. The results support the developmental stability and provide evidence of a rich and well-organized prosociality that before the second year of life proves to be based on some moral principles and linked with a sophisticated psychological reasoning. The findings shed light on the claims that human capacities for the social evaluation of defensive behaviors toward third parties are rooted in evolved cooperative systems.

Previous studies found that toddlers' temperamental inhibition may influence their empathy, but mainly focused on emotional response to others' distress. Little is known about whether inhibited children's poor empathy is due to high reactivity and social withdrawal when sharing others' affective states, such as distress (affective empathy), or to a difficulty in comprehending and inferring others' perspective (cognitive empathy). The current study investigated the role of behavioral inhibition (BI) in affective empathy (response to pain simulation) and cognitive empathy (performance in perspective-taking task) among 163 Chinese toddlers and tested in both only and non-only children. Correlation analyses showed that BI was only negatively associated with affective empathy. The relation between BI and cognitive empathy was moderated by self-regulation and inhibited children who were low in self-regulation presented low cognitive empathy. Additionally, only children presented advanced cognitive empathy but poorer affective empathy than non-only children. These findings imply different roles of BI in affective versus cognitive empathy in early childhood. Although highly inhibited children rarely show positive social expression toward others' distress, caution is needed in inferring that they lack a capacity for cognitive empathy.

Experiment 1 (N = 67) used a novel task for inducing scale errors among 24- to 29-month-olds. Results replicated rates of scale errors found in previous research that used different tasks. Experiment 2 used sequential touching (N = 31) and sorting measures (N = 23) to test categorization in 24-month-old children. In both measures, children showed categorization at the basic level when there was high contrast between the exemplars, but not at a basic level with low contrast or a subordinate level. In Experiments 1 and 2, half the participants were tested while wearing weighted wristbands. Weighting the arms did not affect error rates, in contrast to previous research showing that weights improved performance in search tasks. The findings are discussed in light of children's difficulty in integrating perception, cognition, and action.

J	Custode, SA; Tamis-LeMonda, C				Custode, Stephanie A.; Tamis-LeMonda, Catherine			Cracking the code: Social and contextual cues to language input in the home environment	INFANCY												Infants use social cues like gaze and touch, typically during joint attention with caregivers, to decipher word meaning. Yet, studies on cues to word meaning primarily rely on structured tasks, where distractors are few compared to the countless objects that vie for attention in the home environment. Forty mothers and their 13-month-old infants were video-recorded during home routines. From transcripts, 3,000+ "naming events" were coded for social (visual and manual) and contextual (location: room and place) cues to the object of reference. Mother and infant visual and tactile attention accompanied naming events with high regularity, and the objects mothers named were specific to room and place. Nested social and contextual cues infuse infants' everyday language experiences in ways that help infants disambiguate word meaning.

Hearing children in two control groups were matched to children with cochlear implants, either by child chronological age (n = 12; mean age = 27.4 months) or by child hearing experience (n = 12; mean age 12 months). All three groups of mother-child dyads were audio-recorded playing together. Mothers and children in all groups imitated their partners' vocalization and word utterances; however, the cochlear implant and hearing experience-matched groups produced fewer word imitations than the age-matched group. The frequency of preceding child vocalization or word production predicted maternal imitation type (vocalization or word); however, frequency of maternal vocalization predicted child vocalization imitation only. The results showed that child hearing experience affected imitation in both communication partners.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV	2020	25	6					827	850		10.1111/infa.12363	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12363		AUG 2020						32799404					WOS:000560118000001

This prosodic parsing ability is well-attested and is a cornerstone to the development of speech perception and grammar. However, infants also receive linguistic input in child songs. This study provides evidence that infants parse songs into meaningful phrasal units and replicates previous research for speech. Six-month-old Dutch infants (n = 80) were tested in the song or speech modality in the head-turn preference procedure. First, infants were familiarized to two versions of the same word sequence: One version represented a well-formed unit, and the other contained a phrase boundary halfway through. At test, infants were presented two passages, each containing one version of the familiarized sequence. The results for speech replicated the previously observed preference for the passage containing the well-formed sequence, but only in a more fine-grained analysis. The preference for well-formed phrases was also observed in the song modality, indicating that infants recognize phrase structure in song. There were acoustic differences between stimuli of the current and previous studies, suggesting that infants are flexible in their processing of boundary cues while also providing a possible explanation for differences in effect sizes.

J	Kavsek, M				Kavsek, Michael			Infants' responsiveness to half-occlusions in phantom stereograms	INFANCY												The present natural preference study investigated infants 4 and 7 months of age for their ability to respond to phantom contoubrs, illusory surfaces generated by half-occlusions in a stereoscopic display consisting of a pair of parallel vertical lines. The left line in the half-image for the right eye and the right line in the half-image for the left eye have a gap in the middle. The visual system accounts for the binocular unmatched gaps by perceiving an illusory contour. Infants in the experimental condition were presented with a standard phantom stereogram displaying a phantom contour versus a non-standard phantom stereogram, the half-images of which were exchanged. This stereogram evokes the impression of two small separate illusory contours. In both stereograms, the gaps moved up and down. The participants aged 7 but not 4 months preferred looking at the standard phantom stereogram. A control condition supported the hypothesis that the infants 7 months of age in the experimental condition indeed responded to the coherent illusory surface instead of simply detecting differences in the geometric arrangement of the half-occlusions. The results hence indicate that infants are able to extract spatial information from monocular regions in a binocular display.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV	2020	25	6					797	808		10.1111/infa.12362	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12362		AUG 2020						32761873					WOS:000563901100001
J	Piccardi, ES; Johnson, MH; Gliga, T				Piccardi, Elena Serena; Johnson, Mark H.; Gliga, Teodora			Explaining individual differences in infant visual sensory seeking	INFANCY												Individual differences in infants' engagement with their environment manifest early in development and are noticed by parents. Three views have been advanced to explain differences in seeking novel stimulation. Theoptimal stimulation hypothesissuggests that individuals seek further stimulation when they are under-responsive to current sensory input. Theprocessing speed hypothesisproposes that those capable of processing information faster are driven to seek stimulation more frequently. Theinformation prioritization hypothesissuggests the differences in stimulation seeking index variation in the prioritization of incoming relative to ongoing information processing. Ten-month-old infants saw 10 repetitions of a video clip and changes in frontal theta oscillatory amplitude were measured as an index of information processing speed. Stimulus-locked P1 peak amplitude in response to checkerboards briefly overlaid on the video at random points during its presentation indexed processing of incoming stimulation. Parental report of higher visual seeking did not relate to reduced P1 peak amplitude or to a stronger decrease in frontal theta amplitude with repetition, thus not supporting either theoptimal stimulationor theprocessing speed hypotheses. Higher visual seeking occurred in those infants whose P1 peak amplitude was greater than expected based on their theta amplitude. These findings indicate that visual sensory seeking in infancy is explained by a bias toward novel stimulation, thus supporting theinformation prioritizationhypothesis.

Stereograms of the Lang-Stereopad(R)were presented in a timed preferential-looking paradigm to determine infants' preference for a stereogram as compared to a stimulus not inducing an impression of depth. A total of 80 infants were tested at 7 months of age; of these, a sub-sample of 41 infants were tested longitudinally at 4 and 7 months to characterize the developmental trajectory of their preference. Infants were simultaneously presented with a card showing a random-dot stereogram (800" disparity) and a similar looking dummy card without stereogram. In the total sample, 7-month-olds showed a clear preference for the stereogram regardless of sex. In the longitudinal sample, 7-month-olds but not 4-month-olds looked significantly longer to the stereogram as compared to the dummy card. On individual level, 56% of the 4-month-olds and 85% of the 7-month-olds predominantly looked at the stereogram. The findings yield evidence for a clear developmental progression and show that the test cards of the Lang-Stereopad(R)prototype provide a viable instrument to determine the preference for depth-inducing stimuli in young infants when used in a controlled experimental setting.

J	Zhang, F; Emberson, LL				Zhang, Felicia; Emberson, Lauren L.			Using pupillometry to investigate predictive processes in infancy	INFANCY												Prediction, a prospective cognitive process, is increasingly believed to be crucial for adult cognition and learning. Despite decades of targeted research on prediction in adults, methodological limitations still exist for investigating prediction in infancy. In this article, we argue that pupillometry, or the measurement of pupil size, is an effective method to examine predictive processing in infants and will expand on existing methods (namely looking time and anticipatory eye movements). In particular, we argue that there are three specific features of pupillometry that make it particularly useful for augmenting the investigation of prediction in infancy. First, pupillometry has excellent temporal resolution that will facilitate the differentiation of prediction subcomponents. Second, pupillometry is highly continuous across the life span, allowing researchers to directly compare responses between infants and adults using an identical paradigm. Third, pupillometry can be used in conjunction with other behavioral measures, allowing for different yet complementary results. In addition, we review relevant adult and infant pupillometry studies that will facilitate infancy researchers to adopt this technique. Overall, pupillometry is particularly useful in investigating prediction in infancy and opens up several avenues for developmental research.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV	2020	25	6					758	780		10.1111/infa.12358	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12358		JUL 2020						32735079					WOS:000555700800001

Thus, in the current study we explored the nature of parent-child discourse while engaging in media (i.e., joint media engagement) with infants, and how parent (empathic concern and responsiveness) and child (negative emotionality and regulatory capacity) variables might be associated with the quality of engagement. The current study consisted of 269 infants (50% female,M-age = 17.09 months,SD = 3.93; 59% White) and their primary caregiver (98% mothers) who engaged in a variety of in-home tasks and parental questionnaires. Results established three meaningful codes for both parent and child that assessed positive and negative joint media engagement. Further, results suggested that parental empathic concern was associated with positive parent and child media engagement, while child negative emotionality was associated with lower levels of distraction. Discussion focuses on the importance of studying parent-child discourse in the context of joint media engagement and recommends limiting media exposure before 18 months of age.

The current study inquired whether, at only 14 months of age, infants can track co-occurrence patterns between function words and content words (e.g., determiners can precede nouns, and pronouns can precede verbs), and use these previously encountered syntactic contexts to build expectations about which function words can co-occur with novel words. Using a habituation paradigm, French-learning 14-month-olds were presented with utterances containing two novel words preceded by function words (either two determiners in the Novel Nouns condition or two pronouns in the Novel Verbs conditions). We found that at test, infants looked longer during trials in which the novel words occurred in an unexpected syntactic context (following a pronoun for infants in the Novel Nouns condition and following a determiner for infants in the pooled analysis of the three Novel Verbs conditions). Hence, our results confirm previous findings on infants' sensitivity to noun contexts and most importantly demonstrate that their sensitivity to the co-occurrence of verbs with pronouns begins much earlier than previously understood.

Although behavior is transient and ephemeral, we have the technology to make it tangible and enduring. Video uniquely captures and preserves the details of behavior and the surrounding context. By sharing videos for documentation and data reuse, we can exploit the tremendous opportunities provided by infancy research and overcome the important challenges in studying behavior. The Datavyu video coding software and Databrary digital video library provide tools and infrastructure for mining and sharing the richness of video. This article is based on my Presidential Address to the International Congress on Infant Studies in New Orleans, May 22, 2016 (Video 1 at ).

Factors affecting infant toy preferences: Age, gender, experience, motor development, and parental attitude	INFANCY												In contrast to the anecdotal claim that "male infants like cars and female infants like dolls," previous studies have reported mixed findings for gender-related toy preferences in infancy. In Experiment 1, we explored the emergence of gender-related preferences using face-car pairs (Experiment 1a,n = 51, 6-20 months) or face-stove pairs (Experiment 1b,n = 54, 6-20 months). In Experiment 2 (n = 42, 14-16 months), we explore the effect of toy properties, infants' past toy exposure, activity levels, and parental attitudes on such preferences using a wider range of toys. For both studies, infants demonstrated a general preference for faced stimuli over other objects, except for male infants who showed no preference between dolls and cars at around 15 months. Infants' prior experience participating in motor-intensive activities, with wheeled toys and parental attitudes appeared to relate to female infants' preferences for dynamic toys. These results indicate a range of factors influence gendered toy preferences and suggest that nurture plays an important role.

Infant researchers contend with unique problems that might make preregistration particularly challenging. Infants are a hard-to-reach population, usually yielding small sample sizes, they can only complete a limited number of trials, and they can be excluded based on hard-to-predict complications (e.g., parental interference, fussiness). In addition, as effects themselves potentially change with age and population, it is hard to calculate an a priori effect size. At the same time, these very factors make preregistration in infant studies a valuable tool. A priori examination of the planned study, including the hypotheses, sample size, and resulting statistical power, increases the credibility of single studies and adds value to the field. Preregistration might also improve explicit decision making to create better studies. We present an in-depth discussion of the issues uniquely relevant to infant researchers, and ways to contend with them in preregistration and study planning. We provide recommendations to researchers interested in following current best practices.					; Bergmann, Christina/J-2765-2014	Havron, Naomi/0000-0001-6429-1546; Bergmann, Christina/0000-0003-2656-9070; Tsuji, Sho/0000-0001-9580-4500													1525-0008	1532-7078				SEP	2020	25	5					734	754		10.1111/infa.12353	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12353		JUN 2020						32857441					WOS:000542910500001

An eye-tracking investigation of 7-month-old infants' visual scanning patterns	INFANCY												Seven-month-old infants display a robust attentional bias for fearful faces; however, the mechanisms driving this bias remain unclear. The objective of the current study was to replicate the attentional bias for fearful faces and to investigate how infants' online scanning patterns relate to this preference. Infants' visual scanning patterns toward fearful and happy faces were captured using eye tracking in a paired-preference task, specifically exploring if the fear preference is driven by increased attention to particular facial features. Infants allocated increased attention toward the fearful face compared to the happy face overall, thus successfully replicating the attentional bias, and greater attention toward the fearful eyes was associated with a greater magnitude of the fear preference. The current findings suggest that the fearful eyes are a salient facial feature in capturing infants' attention toward the fearful face and that increased scanning of the fearful eyes may be one mechanism driving the overall fear preference. In addition, scanning patterns, and attention to critical features specifically, are highlighted as a strategy for examining the mechanisms underlying the development of emotion recognition abilities in infancy.

Infants' sensitivity to shape changes in 2D visual forms	INFANCY												Research in developmental cognitive science reveals that human infants perceive shape changes in 2D visual forms that are repeatedly presented over long durations. Nevertheless, infants' sensitivity to shape under the brief conditions of natural viewing has been little studied. Three experiments tested for this sensitivity by presenting 128 seven-month-old infants with shapes for the briefer durations under which they might see them in dynamic scenes. The experiments probed infants' sensitivity to two fundamental geometric properties of scale- and orientation-invariant shape:relative lengthandangle.Infants detected shape changes in closed figures, which presented changes in both geometric properties. Infants also detected shape changes in open figures differing in angle when figures were presented at limited orientations. In contrast, when open figures were presented at unlimited orientations, infants detected changes in relative length but not in angle. The present research therefore suggests that, as infants look around at the cluttered and changing visual world, relative length is the primary geometric property by which they perceive scale- and orientation-invariant shape.

Object exploration during the transition to sitting: A study of infants at heightened risk for autism spectrum disorder	INFANCY												Learning to sit promotes infants' object exploration because it offers increased access to objects and an improved position for exploration. Infants at heightened risk (HR) for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit delays in sitting and differences in object exploration. However, little is known about theassociationbetween sitting and object exploration among HR infants. We examined changes in object exploration as HR infants (N = 19) and comparison infants with no family history of ASD (Low Risk; LR;N = 23) gained experience sitting independently. Infants were observed monthly from 2.5 months until 1 month after the onset of independent sitting. At 12, 18, 24, and 36 months, infants completed standardized developmental assessments, and HR infants were assessed for ASD symptoms at 36 months. Although HR infants began sitting later than LR infants, both groups increased time spent grasping, shaking, banging, and mouthing objects as they gained sitting experience. Groups only differed in time spent actively mouthing objects, with LR infants showing a greater increase in active mouthing than HR infants. Findings suggest that HR infants experience a similar progression of object exploration across sitting development, but on a delayed time scale.

Yet, the influence of technoference on parent-infant interactions and infant behaviors has received less attention and more experimental work is warranted. For this study, parent-infant dyads (n = 227) completed a modified still-face paradigm (SFP) using a mobile phone during the still-face phase. Infant responses were coded for positive and negative affect, object and parent orientation, self-comforting, and escape behaviors during the task. Results showed a robust still-face effect, with infants displaying increased negative affect, decreased positive affect, increased self-comforting, object orientation, and escape behaviors during the "still-face" or phone distracted phase of the paradigm and frequently failing to return to baseline during the reunion phase. Older infants (older than 9 months) likewise demonstrated higher levels of negative affect across all three phases of the paradigm relative to younger infants (less than 9 months). Parent reports of technoference behavior were related to increased object orientation for younger infants. Parental technoference behaviors were also linked to more escape behaviors for younger infants and decreased object orientation in older infants during the still-face portion of the SFP.

Our main question was which changes to the words may go unnoticed and which may lead the words to be unrecognizable. One-hundred 11-month-old Hebrew-learning infants were tested in two experiments using the Central Fixation Procedure. In Experiment 1, 20 infants were presented with iambic Familiar and Unfamiliar words. The infants listened longer to Familiar than to Unfamiliar words, indicating their recognition of frequently heard word forms. In Experiment 2, four groups of 20 infants each were tested in each of four conditions involving altered iambic Familiar words contrasted with iambic Unfamiliar nonwords. In each condition, one segment in the Familiar word was changed-either a consonant or a vowel, in either the first (unstressed) or the second (stressed) syllable. In each condition, recognition of the Familiar words despite the change indicates a less accurate or less well-specified representation. Infants recognized Familiar words despite changes to the weak (first) syllable, regardless of whether the change involved a consonant or a vowel (conditions 2a, 2c). However, a change of either consonant or vowel in the stressed (second) syllable blocked word recognition (conditions 2b, 2d). These findings support the proposal that stress pattern plays a key role in early word representation, regardless of segmental identity.

Play in Mexican-American mothers and toddlers is frequent, multimodal, and rich in symbolic content	INFANCY												Play offers rich opportunities for toddlers to develop motor, social, cognitive, and language skills, particularly during interactions with adult caregivers who may scaffold toddlers to higher levels of play than toddlers achieve on their own. However, research on play has narrowly focused on children from White, middle-income backgrounds, leaving a dearth of knowledge about dyadic play in diverse cultural communities. We videorecorded 222 Mexican-American mothers playing with their 2-year-old toddlers with a standard set of toys. Play behaviors were coded as nonsymbolic or symbolic (play type) and as expressed through manual, verbal, or multiple channels (play modality). Play between toddlers and mothers was frequent, high in symbolic content, and toddler play closely corresponded with mother play in type and modality: Toddlers' nonsymbolic play related to mothers' nonsymbolic play; toddlers' symbolic play related to mothers' symbolic play; toddlers' manual play related to mothers' manual play; and toddlers' multimodal play related to mothers' multimodal play. Play in Mexican-American mothers and toddlers is frequent, multimodal, and symbolically rich, offering new directions for future research and practice.

Robust data and power in infant research: A case study of the effect of number of infants and number of trials in visual preference procedures	INFANCY												As in many areas of science, infant research suffers from low power. The problem is further compounded in infant research because of the difficulty in recruiting and testing large numbers of infant participants. Researchers have been searching for a solution and, as illustrated by this special section, have been focused on getting the most out of infant data. We illustrate one solution by showing how we can increase power in visual preference tasks by increasing the amount of data obtained from each infant. We discuss issues of power and present work examining how, under some circumstances, power is increased by increasing the precision of measurement. We report the results of a series of simulations based on a sample of visual preference task data collected from three infant laboratories showing how more powerful research designs can be achieved by including more trials per infant. Implications for infant procedures in general are discussed.

The suitability of these approaches varies as a function of the specific research interests at hand. Although the approaches are interdependent, they have often proceeded as parallel research traditions. The current review notes some of the historical and empirical bases for this divide and suggests that each tradition would benefit from incorporating both methodological approaches to iteratively examine universal (nomothetic) phenomena and the individual differences (idiographic) factors that lead to variation in development. This work may help isolate underlying causal mechanisms, better understand current functioning, and predict long-term developmental consequences. In doing so, we also highlight empirical and structural issues that need to be addressed to support this integration.					; Perez-Edgar, Koraly/H-7365-2019	Vallorani, Alicia/0000-0003-2122-5690; LoBue, Vanessa/0000-0002-4386-3549; Perez-Edgar, Koraly/0000-0003-4051-9563													1525-0008	1532-7078				JUL	2020	25	4					438	457		10.1111/infa.12338	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12338		MAY 2020						32744796					WOS:000530470500001

Capturing temporal dynamics of fear behaviors on a moment-to-moment basis	INFANCY												Identifying patterns of fearful behaviors early and accurately is essential to identify children who may be at increased risk for psychopathology. Previous work focused on the total amount of fear by using composites across time. However, considering the temporal dynamics of fear expression might offer novel insights into the identification of children at risk. One hundred and twenty-five toddlers participated in high- and low-fear tasks. Data were modeled using a novel two-step approach. First, a hidden Markov model estimated latent fear states and transitions across states over time. Results revealed children's behavior was best represented by six behavioral states. Next, these states were analyzed using sequence clustering to identify groups of children with similar dynamic trajectories through the states. A four-cluster solution found groups of children varied in fear response and regulation process: external regulators (using the caregiver as a regulation tool), low reactive (low reaction to stimulus), fearful explorers (managing their own internal state with minimal assistance from the caregiver), and high fear (fearful/at-caregiver state regardless of task). The combination of analytic tools enabled fine-grained examination of the processes of fearful temperament. These insights may help prevention programs target behaviors that perpetuate anxious behavior in the moment.					; Brick, Timothy/C-9966-2015	Shewark, Elizabeth/0000-0002-9481-0789; Brick, Timothy/0000-0002-3339-9279													1525-0008	1532-7078				MAY	2020	25	3					264	285		10.1111/infa.12328	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12328								32395080					WOS:000556930800003
J	Kalashnikova, M; Goswami, U; Burnham, D				Kalashnikova, Marina; Goswami, Usha; Burnham, Denis			Infant-directed speech to infants at risk for dyslexia: A novel cross-dyad design	INFANCY												When mothers speak to infants at risk for developmental dyslexia, they do not hyperarticulate vowels in their infantdirected speech (IDS). Here, we used an innovative crossdyad design to investigate whether the absence of vowel hyperarticulation in IDS to at-risk infants is a product of maternal infant-directed behavior or of infants parentdirected cues. Interactions between mothers and infants who were at risk or not at risk for dyslexia were recorded in three conditions: when mothers interacted with (a) their own infants, (b) infants who were not their own but of the same risk status, and (c) infants who were not their own and of the opposite risk status. This design revealed both infant and parent effects. Mothers of not-at-risk infants hyperarticulated vowels significantly more when speaking to notat-risk than to at-risk infants. In contrast, mothers of at-risk infants hyperarticulated vowels significantly less than NAR mothers, and this was irrespective of infant status. Mothers of not-at-risk infants thus adjusted their IDS to the infant's risk status, while mothers of at-risk infants did not. We suggest that IDS is determined reciprocally by characteristics of both partners in the dyad: Both infant and maternal factors are essential for the vowel hyperarticulation component of IDS.

The importance of using multiple outcome measures in infant research	INFANCY												Collecting data with infants is notoriously difficult. As a result, many of our studies consist of small samples, with only a single measure, in a single age group, at a single time point. With renewed calls for greater academic rigor in data collection practices, using multiple outcome measures in infant research is one way to increase rigor, and, at the same time, enable us to more accurately interpret our data. Here, we illustrate the importance of using multiple measures in psychological research with examples from our own work on rapid threat detection and from the broader infancy literature. First, we describe our initial studies using a single outcome measure, and how this strategy caused us to nearly miss a rich and complex story about attention biases for threat and their development. We demonstrate how using converging measures can help researchers make inferences about infant behavior, and how using additional measures allows us to more deeply examine the mechanisms that drive developmental change. Finally, we provide practical and statistical recommendations for how researchers can use multiple measures in future work.

Evidence supporting these models is scarce in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study tests the relations between maternal knowledge, stimulation, and child development in a Colombian sample of 1,277 low-income mothers and their children under the age of five. Mothers showed diverse knowledge about child development and caregiving. Moreover, maternal knowledge when children were 9-26 months old indirectly predicted growth in children's cognitive, receptive language, and gross motor skills at ages 27-46 months, partially through maternal engagement in stimulating activities with the child.

Infants prefer IDS over adult-directed speech (ADS) and IDS is functionally relevant in infant-directed communication. We examined interactions among maternal IDS quality, infants' preference for IDS over ADS, and the functional relevance of IDS at 6 and 13 months. While 6-month-olds showed a preference for IDS over ADS, 13-month-olds did not. Differences in gaze following behavior triggered by speech register (IDS vs. ADS) were found in both age groups. The degree of infants' preference for IDS (relative to ADS) was linked to the quality of maternal IDS infants were exposed to. No such relationship was found between gaze following behavior and maternal IDS quality and infants' IDS preference. The results speak to a dynamic interaction between infants' preference for different kinds of social signals and the social cues available to them.

Robust word comprehension requires generalizing known labels to new category members. While young infants have been found to look at common nouns when they are named aloud, the role of item familiarity has not been well examined. This study compares 12- to 18-month-olds' word comprehension in the context of pairs of their own items (e.g., photographs of their own shoe and ball) versus new tokens from the same category (e.g., a new shoe and ball). Our results replicate previous work showing that noun comprehension improves rapidly over the second year, while also suggesting that item familiarity appears to play a far smaller role in comprehension in this age range. This in turn suggests that even before age 2, ready generalization beyond particular experiences is an intrinsic component of lexical development.

J	Von Holzen, K; Nazzi, T				Von Holzen, Katie; Nazzi, Thierry			Emergence of a consonant bias during the first year of life: New evidence from own-name recognition	INFANCY												Recent evidence suggests that during the first year of life, a preference for consonant information during lexical processing (consonant bias) emerges, at least for some languages like French. Our study investigated the factors involved in this emergence as well as the developmental consequences for variation in consonant bias emergence. In a series of experiments, we measured 5-, 8-, and 11-month-old French-learning infants orientation times to a consonant or vowel mispronunciation of their own name, which is one of the few word forms familiar to infants at this young age. Both 5- and 8-month-olds oriented longer to vowel mispronunciations, but 11-month-olds showed a different pattern, initially orienting longer to consonant mispronunciations. We interpret these results as further evidence of an initial vowel bias, with consonant bias emergence by 11 months. Neither acoustic-phonetic nor lexical factors predicted preferences in 8- and 11-month-olds. Finally, counter to our predictions, a vowel bias at the time of test for 11-month-olds was related to later productive vocabulary outcomes.

Visual short-term memory for overtly attended objects during infancy	INFANCY												We investigated limitations in young infants' visual short-term memory (VSTM). We used a one-shot change detection task to ask whether 4- and 8.5-month-old infants (N = 59) automatically encode fixated items in VSTM. Our task included trials that consisted of the following sequence: first a brief (500 ms) presentation with a sample array of two items, next a brief (300 ms) delay period with a blank screen, and finally a test array (2,000 ms) identical to the sample array except that the color of one of the two items is changed. In Experiment 1, we induced infants to fixate one item by rotating it during the sample (the other item remained stationary). In Experiment 2, none of the items rotated. In both experiments, 4-month-old infants looked equally at the fixated item when it did and did not change color, providing no evidence that they encoded in VSTM the fixated item. In contrast, 8.5-month-old infants in Experiment 1 preferred the fixated item when it changed color from sample to test. Thus, 4-month-old infants do not appear to automatically encode fixated items in VSTM.

Evidence from Basque	INFANCY												Attunement theories of speech perception development suggest that native-language exposure is one of the main factors shaping infants' phonemic discrimination capacity within the second half of their first year. Here, we focus on the role of acoustic-perceptual salience and language-specific experience by assessing the discrimination of acoustically subtle Basque sibilant contrasts. We used the infant-controlled version of the habituation procedure to assess discrimination in 6- to 7-month and 11- to 12-month-old infants who varied in their amount of exposure to Basque and Spanish. We observed no significant variation in the infants' discrimination behavior as a function of their linguistic experience. Infants in both age-groups exhibited poor discrimination, consistent with Basque adults finding these contrasts more difficult than some others. Our findings are in agreement with previous research showing that perceptual discrimination of subtle speech sound contrasts may follow a different developmental trajectory, where increased native-language exposure seems to be a requisite.

These may have important consequences for infants' social-cognitive development. The current study investigated effects of maternal sensitive and intrusive behavior on 6- to 7-month-old infants' ERP responses to a socio-emotional cue that infants are often confronted with from an early age: emotional prosody in infant-directed speech. Infants may differ in their sensitivity to environmental (including parenting) influences on development, and the current study also explored whether infants' resting frontal asymmetry conveys differential susceptibility to effects of maternal sensitivity and intrusiveness. Results revealed that maternal intrusiveness was related to the difference in infants' ERP responses to happy and angry utterances. Specifically, P2 amplitudes in response to angry sounds were less positive than those in response to happy sounds for infants with less intrusive mothers. Whether this difference reflects an enhanced sensitivity to emotional prosody or a (processing) preference remains to be investigated. No evidence for differential susceptibility was found, as infant frontal asymmetry did not moderate effects of sensitivity or intrusiveness.

Here, we apply a propensity score matching approach to estimate relations between electronic screen-based media use in infancy and executive function in early toddlerhood. In an international sample of 416 firstborn infants, parental report of regular exposure to screen-based media at 4 months predicted poorer performance on a test of inhibition at 14 months, but was unrelated to either cognitive flexibility or working memory at 14 months. Results of this study are therefore consistent with the view that early exposure to screen-based media adversely affects the development of executive function.

INFANCY												While phonological development is well-studied in infants, we know less about morphological development. Previous studies suggest that infants around one year of age can process words analytically (i.e., they can decompose complex forms to a word stem and its affixes) in morphologically simpler languages such as English and French. The current study explored whether 15-month-old infants learning Hungarian, a morphologically complex, agglutinative language with vowel harmony, are able to decompose words into a word stem and a suffix. Potential differences between analytical processing of complex forms with back versus front vowels were also studied. The results of Experiment 1 indicate that Hungarian infants process morphologically complex words analytically when they contain a frequent suffix. Analytic processing is present both in the case of complex forms with back and front vowels according to the results of Experiment 2. In light of the results, we argue for the potential relevance of the early development of analytic processing for language development.

This study examined the effects of the September 11, 2001, trauma on mother-infant interaction in mothers who were pregnant and widowed on 9/11, and their infants aged 4-6 months. Split-screen videotaped interaction was coded on a one-second basis for infant gaze, facial affect, and vocal affect; and mother gaze, facial affect, and touch. We examined the temporal dynamics of communication: self-contingency and interactive contingency of behavior by time-series methods. We documented heightened maternal and infant efforts at engagement in the 9/11 (vs. control) dyads. Both partners had difficulty tolerating moments of looking away as well as moments of negative behavior patterns. Heightened efforts to maintain a positive visual engagement may be adaptive and a potential source of resilience, but these patterns may also carry risk: working too hard to make it work. A vigilant, hyper-contingent, high-arousal engagement was the central mode of the interpersonal transmission of the trauma to these infants, with implications for intervention.

INFANCY												Little is known about the effects of olfaction on visual processing during infancy. We investigated whether and how an infant's own mother's body odor or another mother's body odor affects 4-month-old infants' looking at their mother's face when it is paired with a stranger's face. In Experiment 1, infants were exposed to their mother's body odor or to a control odor, while in Experiment 2, infants were exposed to a stranger mother's body odor while their visual preferences were recorded. Results revealed that infants looked more at the stranger's female face in presence of the control odor but that they looked more at their mother's face in the context of any mother's body odors. This effect was due to a reduction of looking at the stranger's face. These findings suggest that infants react similarly to the body odor of any mother and add to the growing body of evidence indicating that olfactory stimulation represents a pervasive aspect of infant multisensory perception.

Longitudinal links between maternal factors and infant cognition: Moderation by infant sleep	INFANCY												The current study examined the moderating role of infant sleep in the link between maternal factors (i.e., maternal education, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance) and infant cognition. Data come from 95 African American parent-child dyads. At 3 months of age, infant sleep was objectively measured using videosomnography and actigraphy, from which measures of sleep regulation and consolidation were calculated. Mothers also self-reported their level of education, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. At 6 months of age, infants completed cognitive assessments, including a measure of general cognitive ability and observed attention behavior. Findings revealed that infant sleep quality interacted with maternal education and sleep disturbances to predict cognition. Specifically, the link between maternal education and infants' attention behavior was significant and positive for infants with better regulated sleep, but not for infants with poorly regulated sleep. Similarly, the link between maternal sleep disturbance and infant cognition depended on infant sleep quality. For infants with poorer sleep consolidation, increased maternal sleep disturbance predicted poorer infant general cognitive ability. For infants with better sleep consolidation, maternal sleep disturbance was positively related to both general cognitive ability and attention behavior. These findings suggest that infant sleep quality moderates the impact of environmental factors on cognitive functioning.

Mothers' appropriate mind-related comments were associated with average level, length, complexity, and maturity level of symbolic play. Specific sub-categories of appropriate mind-related comments were identified as independent predictors of children's symbolic play. Appropriate comments about desires and cognitions at 6 months were associated with average level and length of episodes, as well as with maturity level of symbolic play at 12 months. Longitudinal stability in the appropriateness and content of mothers' mind-related comments was also investigated. The results are discussed in terms of the proposal that attunement to specific types of internal state should vary as a function of infant age in order to index mind-mindedness.

Developmental outcomes of infants adopted from foster care: Predictive associations from perinatal and preplacement risk factors	INFANCY												Infants adopted domestically from foster care often present with prenatal substance exposure and risky birth outcomes such as prematurity and low birthweight. Because few longitudinal studies of foster-adoptive infants exist, it is unclear how these preplacement risk factors influence development over time. The present study examined associations between perinatal risk factors and developmental outcomes among an ethnically/racially diverse sample of 97 infants in foster care (56% boys) placed into adoptive homes at ages 0-19 months. Relative to population norms, foster-adoptive infants showed comparable cognitive but lower language and motor functioning at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Age-adjusted language scores significantly improved 1 year following placement, consistent with a developmental "catch-up" effect. Low birthweight uniquely predicted lower language scores at baseline, but this association was no longer significant at follow-up. Prenatal substance exposure was associated with lower baseline cognitive scores, but only for infants placed after 6 months of age. In contrast, infants with low birthweight and later placement age (>12 months) showed the most accelerated motor development. Sex differences emerged at follow-up when predicting motor and language outcomes, suggesting potential sex-specific pathways of risk. Overall, results support adoption as an early intervention that may buffer vulnerability to perinatal risk on development.

J	Attisano, E; Denison, S				Attisano, Elizabeth; Denison, Stephanie			Infants' reasoning about samples generated by intentional versus non-intentional agents	INFANCY												The current experiments investigate how infants use goal-directed action to reason about intentionally sampled outcomes in a probabilistic inference paradigm. Older infants and young children are flexible in their expectations of sampling: They expect random samples to reflect population statistics and non-random samples to reflect an agent's preferences or goals (Kushnir, Xu, & Wellman, 2010; Xu & Denison, 2009). However, more recent work shows that probabilistic inference comes online at approximately 6 months (Denison, Reed, & Xu, 2013; Kayhan, Gredeback, & Lindskog, 2017; Ma & Xu, 2011; Wellman, Kushnir, Xu, & Brink, 2016), and thus, these sampling assumptions can be investigated at the age probabilistic reasoning first emerges. Results indicate that 6-month-old infants expect a human agent to sample in accord with their goal and do not expect the same of an unintentional agent-a mechanical claw. By 9.5 months, infants expect the mechanical claw to sample in accord with random sampling. These results suggest that infants use goals to make inferences about intentional sampling, under appropriate conditions at 6 months, and they have expectations of the kinds of samples a mechanical device should obtain by 9.5 months.

Maternal neural reactivity during pregnancy predicts infant temperament	INFANCY												Maternal biological systems impact infant temperament as early as the prenatal period, though the mechanisms of this association are unknown. Using a prospective, longitudinal design, we found that maternal (N = 89) amplitudes of the late positive potential (LPP) in response to negative stimuli during the second, but not the third, trimester of pregnancy predicted observed and physiological indices of temperamental reactivity in infants at age 4 months. Maternal LPP was positively associated with observed infant fear and negatively associated with frontal EEG asymmetry and cortisol reactivity in infants at age 4 months. Results identify a putative mechanism, early in pregnancy, for the intergenerational transmission of emotional reactivity from mother to infant.

In the current study, we used the Communication Complexity Scale (CCS) to measure prelinguistic complexity of typically developing infants in a cross-sectional sample of 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-month-olds (N = 204) during semi-structured play interaction. For each toy/interactive episode, infants' highest level of communication complexity (ranging from 0 for no response to 12 for multi-word verbalization), for both joint attention (i.e., social) and behavior regulation (e.g., requesting) functions, was scored. In addition, the same interaction was coded for frequency of all prelinguistic communication acts. Results of multivariate models indicated age-related differences in prelinguistic complexity. Measures of prelinguistic complexity and frequency evidenced moderate to strong correlations, with age-related differences by function (joint attention and behavior regulation). Significant associations with parent-report communication questionnaires were observed for both complexity and frequency measures. Results indicate that evaluating complexity of infant preverbal communication skill with the CCS is a valuable approach that can meaningfully index developmental differences in prelinguistic and early linguistic communication.

The current eye-tracking study investigated whether 24-month-olds (n = 149) learn novel words easier while listening to their mother's voice compared to hearing unfamiliar speakers. Our results show that maternal speech facilitates the formation of new word-object mappings across two different learning settings: a live setting in which infants are taught by their own mother or the experimenter, and a prerecorded setting in which infants hear the voice of either their own or another mother through loudspeakers. Furthermore, this study explored whether infants' pointing gestures and novel word productions over the course of the word learning task serve as meaningful indexes of word learning behavior. Infants who repeated more target words also showed a larger learning effect in their looking behavior. Thus, maternal speech and infants' willingness to repeat novel words are positively linked with novel word learning.

Jeffrey; Knight, Bettina			Patterns of positivity: Positive affect trajectories among infants of mothers with a history of depression	INFANCY												This study examined positive affect (PA) trajectories over the first year of life among infants of mothers with a history of depression (N = 191) as well as predictors (i.e., maternal prenatal and postpartum depression symptoms, maternal parenting behaviors) of those trajectories. Infant PA was observed in play and feeding tasks during laboratory visits at 3, 6, and 12 months of age; parenting behaviors were observed at 3 months. Mothers completed questionnaires regarding their symptoms of depression throughout the prenatal period and during the first 3 months postpartum. Growth curve analyses indicated that infant PA increased across time, and this finding replicated across both the play and feeding tasks, though increases slowed over time. Neither maternal prenatal nor postpartum depression symptoms predicted infants' PA trajectories, but mothers' PA, positive parenting, and disengaged parenting were associated with infant PA during the play task. Our finding that infant PA increased over the first year postpartum suggests PA trajectories among infants of mothers with a history of depression may be indices of resilience, despite risks associated with their mothers' history of depression. Furthermore, this study highlights parenting behaviors that may be important targets of prevention and early intervention efforts to bolster infant PA.					Newport, D.

Yet, the two languages co-occurred to various extents within the same half-hour both within and across speakers. We used exploratory correlation analyses to examine potential effects of the dual input on the size of infants' vocabularies.

The effect of the still-face paradigm on infant behavior: A cross-cultural comparison between mothers and fathers	INFANCY												Most still-face paradigm (SFP) studies have been done in Western families with infant-mother dyads. The present study investigated the SFP pattern in 123 Dutch and 63 Chinese 4-month-old infants with mothers and fathers. The classic SFP effect was found for positive affect and gaze in both countries. For negative affect, Chinese infants showed a different SFP pattern than Dutch infants. With fathers, infants displayed a less pronounced SFP pattern for positive affect and an increase from the still face to the reunion for negative affect. Only a minority of infants showed the expected SFP pattern across episodes. Our findings support that infant emotion expression is influenced by parent gender and cultural context. An interesting avenue for further study is the exploration of the origins of within- and between-gender and culture differences in affective communication between parents and infants.

The practical utility of the Welch Emotional Connection Screen for rating parent-infant relational health	INFANCY												Emotional Connection (EC) measured by the Welch Emotional Connection Screen (WECS) was related to the Parent-Infant Interaction Rating System (PIIRS), a 5-point adaptation of the rating system developed for the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (e.g., NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 1999, Developmental Psychology, 35, 1399). Parent-infant dyads (n = 49 mothers; 43 fathers) were videotaped during face-to-face interaction at infant age 6 months; interactions were coded with both the WECS and PIIRS. At age 3, mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist. WECS ratings of EC were associated with PIIRS rating items for both mother-infant and father-infant dyads. Mother-infant EC related positively to maternal sensitivity and positive regard for child, child positive mood and sustained attention, and dyadic mutuality, and negatively with maternal intrusiveness. Father-infant EC related positively to fathers' positive regard for child, child positive mood and sustained attention, and dyadic mutuality. Mother-infant EC predicted child behavior problems at age 3 better than mother-infant PIIRS ratings of dyadic mutuality. With fathers, neither EC nor dyadic mutuality ratings predicted mother-reported child behavior problems. Findings highlight the practical utility of the WECS for identifying potentially at-risk dyads and supporting early relational health.

Sequences of toddler negative emotion and parent-toddler verbal communication during a waking day	INFANCY												Although the second year of life is characterized by dramatic changes in expressive language and by increases in negative emotion expression, verbal communication and emotional communication are often studied separately. With a sample of twenty-five one-year-olds (12-23 months), we used Language Environment Analysis (LENA; Xu, Yapanel, & Gray, 2009, Reliability of the LENA (TM) language environment analysis system in young children's natural home environment. LENA Foundation) to audio-record and quantify parent-toddler communication, including toddlers' vocal negative emotion expressions, across a full waking day. Using a multilevel extension of lag-sequential analysis, we investigated whether parents are differentially responsive to toddlers' negative emotion expressions compared to their verbal or preverbal vocalizations, and we examined the effects of parents' verbal responses on toddlers' subsequent communicative behavior. Toddlers' negative emotions were less likely than their vocalizations to be followed by parent speech. However, when negative emotions were followed by parent speech, toddlers were most likely to vocalize next. Post hoc analyses suggest that older toddlers and toddlers with higher language abilities were more likely to shift from negative emotion to verbal or preverbal vocalization following parent response. Implications of the results for understanding the parent-toddler communication processes that support both emotional development and verbal development are discussed.

M.; Swaab, Hanna			Prenatal risk and physical aggression during the first years of life: The gender-specific role of inhibitory control	INFANCY												Prenatal risk and a lack of inhibitory control have consistently been related to the development of physical aggression in older children. This study examined whether inhibitory control mediated the relation between prenatal risk and aggression in infants and toddlers. The role of gender in this mediation model was also examined. The sample consisted of 161 mother-child dyads (83 boys). A prenatal cumulative risk score was created from a number of well-established risk factors including maternal psychopathology, substance use, and social and socioeconomic disadvantages. At 12 months, children performed an inhibitory control task. Physical aggression was assessed through maternal reports at 12 and 20 months of age. Results showed that higher prenatal risk was associated with more physical aggression. Inhibitory control mediated this association at both 12 and 20 months: higher prenatal risk was related to lower inhibitory control, which in turn led to higher aggression. At 20 months, gender moderated the mediation effect: the mediating role of inhibitory control was only found for girls. These results suggest that even before 2 years of age, inhibitory control is an important construct involved in the relation between prenatal risk and physical aggression.

Recent theoretical models suggest that infant auditory perception may initially encompass a broad range of human and nonhuman vocalizations, then tune in to relevant sounds for the acquisition of species-specific communication sounds. However, little is known about sound properties eliciting infants' tuning-in to speech. To address this issue, we presented a group of 4-month-olds with segments of non-native speech (Mandarin Chinese) and birdsong, a nonhuman vocalization that shares some prosodic components with speech. A second group of infants was presented with the same segment of birdsong paired with Mandarin played in reverse. Infants showed an overall preference for birdsong over non-native speech. Moreover, infants in the Backward condition preferred birdsong over backward speech whereas infants in the Forward condition did not show clear preference. These results confirm the prominent role of prosody in early auditory processing and suggest that infants' preferences may privilege communicative vocalizations featured by certain prosodic dimensions regardless of the biological source of the sound, human or nonhuman.

J	Heimann, M; Tjus, T				Heimann, Mikael; Tjus, Tomas			Neonatal imitation: Temporal characteristics in imitative response patterns	INFANCY												Neonatal imitation has been an area that has attracted intense attention within developmental psychology. Reported here are data from 33 newborn infants (16 girls; mean age: 47 hr) assessed for imitation of tongue protrusion (TP) and mouth opening (MO). The stimuli were presented dynamically, in three 20-second-long gesture modeling intervals, interwoven with three 20-second-long intervals in which the presenter kept a passive face. Imitation of TP emerged among a majority of the infants during the first 60 s of the experiment. In contrast, MO showed a protracted response and a majority exhibited imitation after 60 s. The individual response pattern of the participating infants varied substantially over the course of the experiment. The study provides renewed support for neonatal imitation of MO and TP, and, in addition, suggests that the temporal organization of the responses observed is an important factor to consider, which in turn has methodological and theoretical implications.

J	Orena, AJ; Polka, L				Orena, Adriel John; Polka, Linda			Monolingual and bilingual infants' word segmentation abilities in an inter-mixed dual-language task	INFANCY												Previous studies show that young monolingual infants use language-specific cues to segment words in their native language. Here, we asked whether 8 and 10-month-old infants (N = 84) have the capacity to segment words in an inter-mixed bilingual context. Infants heard an English-French mixed passage that contained one target word in each language, and were then tested on their recognition of the two target words. The English-monolingual and French-monolingual infants showed evidence of segmentation in their native language, but not in the other unfamiliar language. As a group, the English-French bilingual infants segmented in both of their native languages. However, exploratory analyses suggest that exposure to language mixing may play a role in bilingual infants' segmentation skills. Taken together, these results indicate a close relation between language experience and word segmentation skills.

J	Buttelmann, F; Kovacs, AM				Buttelmann, Frances; Kovacs, Agnes Melinda			14-Month-olds anticipate others' actions based on their belief about an object's identity	INFANCY												Past research has accumulated evidence regarding infants' false-belief understanding, measuring their gaze patterns or active helping behaviors. However, the underlying mechanisms are still debated, specifically, whether young infants can compute that others represent the world under a certain aspect. Such performance requires holding in mind two representations about the same object simultaneously and attributing only one to another person. While 14-month-olds can encode an object under different aspects when forming first-person representations, it is unclear whether infants at this very age could also predict others' behavior based on their beliefs about an object's identity. Here, we investigate this question in a novel eye-tracking-based unexpected-identity task. We measured 14-month-olds' anticipatory looks combined with their looking time, using a violation-of-expectation paradigm. Results show that 14-month-olds look longer to an actor's reach that is incongruent with her false belief about the identity of an object compared to a congruent reach. Furthermore, infants correctly anticipated the actor's reach based on her false belief. Thus, as soon as infants represent dual identities they can integrate them in belief attributions and use them for consequent behavioral predictions. Such data provide evidence for the flexibility of false-belief attributions and support proposals arguing for infants' rich theory-of-mind abilities.

We hypothesized that early regulatory problems are associated with attention problems via reduced inhibitory control. This prospective study assessed 1,459 children from birth to 8 years. Crying, feeding, and sleeping problems were assessed at 5 and 20 months via parent interviews and neurological examinations. At 20 months, inhibitory control was tested with a behavioral (snack delay) task. Attention regulation was assessed at 6 and 8 years using multiple instruments and informants. Detrimental effects of crying, feeding, and sleeping problems on attention regulation were partly mediated by children's ability to inhibit unwanted behaviors (beta = -0.04, p = 0.013). Accounting for cognition diminished this indirect effect (beta = -0.01, p = 0.209). Instead, the effects of crying, feeding, and sleeping problems on attention regulation were fully mediated by children's cognitive functioning (beta = -0.10, p < 0.001). These results support that inhibitory control abilities partly mediate effects of crying, feeding, and sleeping problems. However, these effects may be accounted for by children's general cognitive abilities. Early regulatory problems may set infants on a course of under control of behavior into school age, and such trajectories are highly associated with general cognitive development.

A transactional model of infant still-face response and maternal behavior during the first year	INFANCY												The present study takes a transactional approach to extend understanding of temporal relations between parenting behaviors and infant response to the face-to-face still-face, a widely used method assessing infants' affective and behavioral response to a violation of social expectations. A low-income, urban sample of 180 mothers and infants participated when infants were 4 and 6 months old. Directional relations between infants' still-face response (i.e., change in affect and gaze from interaction to still face) and three parenting dimensions were examined using cross-lagged structural equation models. Infant still-face response predicted later parenting behavior, while the reverse association was not significant. Specifically, infants with a greater reduction in positive affect from interaction to still face had parents with more positive parenting and less negative parenting behaviors 2 months later, controlling for prior parenting and concurrent infant behavior. Furthermore, infants who increased gaze to mother from interaction to still face had mothers who used more mental state talk 2 months later. Findings underscore the importance of examining transactional relations between infant and parent behaviors, and in particular highlight the influence of infants on parents. Acknowledging these infant-effects is critical to the development and implementation of interventions targeting parent-infant interactions.

We tested 3-5- and 9-12-month-old infants on a task that allowed us to measure infants' attention orienting bias toward whole objects when they competed with color, motion, and orientation feature information. Infants' attention orienting to whole objects was affected by the dimension of the competing visual feature. Whether attention was biased toward the whole object or its salient competing feature (e.g., "ball" or "red") changed with age for the color feature, with infants biased toward whole objects with age. Moreover, family socioeconomic status predicted feature-based attention in the youngest infants and object-based attention in the older infants when color feature information competed with whole-object information.

Real-world scene perception in infants: What factors guide attention allocation?	INFANCY												The foci of visual attention were modeled as a function of perceptual salience, adult fixation locations, and attentional control mechanisms (measured in separate tasks) in infants (N = 45, 3- to 15-month-olds) as they viewed static real-world scenes. After controlling for the center bias, the results showed that low-level perceptual salience predicts where infants look. In addition, high-level factors also played a role: Infants fixated parts of the scenes frequently fixated by adults and this effect was stronger for older than younger infants. In line with this finding, infant fixation durations were longer on regions more frequently fixated by adults, implying longer time taken to process the available information. Fixation durations decreased with age, and this decline interacted with orienting skills such that fixation durations decreased faster with age for infants with high orienting skills, relative to infants with low orienting skills. There was a further interaction between fixation durations and selective attention abilities: Infants with low selective attention skills showed a decrease in fixation durations with age, whereas infants with higher selective attention skills showed a slight increase in fixation durations with age. These findings imply that infants' visual processing of static real-world stimuli develops in accord with attentional control.

Analyses were based on data collected for 121 mother-infant dyads assessed longitudinally in the newborn period and again at 3 months. In the newborn period, infants' neurobehavior was evaluated using the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) and mothers reported on their caregiving confidence and their newborns' irritability and alertness. At 3 months, mothers reported on their infant's temperament, and mother-infant interactions were videotaped during free play and the FFSF. Three patterns of infant regulatory behavior were observed. The most common was a Social-Positive Oriented Pattern, followed by a Distressed-Inconsolable Pattern, and a Self-Comfort Oriented Pattern. Results of multinomial logistic regression indicated that categorical assignment was not associated with demographic or infant characteristics, but rather with dyadic regulatory processes in which maternal reparatory sensitivity played a crucial role.

INFANCY												Infants can detect individuals who demonstrate emotions that are incongruent with an event and are less likely to trust them. However, the nature of the mechanisms underlying this selectivity is currently subject to controversy. The objective of this study was to examine whether infants' socio-cognitive and associative learning skills are linked to their selective trust. A total of 102 14-month-olds were exposed to a person who demonstrated congruent or incongruent emotional referencing (e.g., happy when looking inside an empty box), and were tested on their willingness to follow the emoter's gaze. Knowledge inference and associative learning tasks were also administered. It was hypothesized that infants would be less likely to trust the incongruent emoter and that this selectivity would be related to their associative learning skills, and not their socio-cognitive skills. The results revealed that infants were not only able to detect the incongruent emoter, but were subsequently less likely to follow her gaze toward an object invisible to them. More importantly, infants who demonstrated superior performance on the knowledge inference task, but not the associative learning task, were better able to detect the person's emotional incongruency. These findings provide additional support for the rich interpretation of infants' selective trust.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				JUL	2019	24	4					480	500		10.1111/infa.12277	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12277								32677254					WOS:000469998100001

Object Interaction and Walking: Integration of Old and New Skills in Infant Development	INFANCY												Manual skills such as reaching, grasping, and exploring objects appear months earlier in infancy than locomotor skills such as walking. To what extent do infants incorporate an old skill (manual actions on objects) into the development of a new skill (walking)? We video recorded 64 sessions of infants during free play in a laboratory playroom. Infants' age (12.7-19.5 months), walking experience (0.5-10.3 months), and walking proficiency (speed, step length, etc.) varied widely. We found that the earlier developing skills of holding and exploring objects were immediately incorporated into the later developing skill of walking. Although holding incurred a reliable cost to infants' gait patterns, holding and exploring objects in hand were relatively common activities and did not change with development. Moreover, holding objects was equally common in standing and walking. However, infants did not interact with objects indiscriminately: Object exploration was more frequent while standing than walking, and infants selectively chose lighter objects to carry and explore. Findings suggest that the earlier appearance of some skills may serve to motivate and enrich later appearing skills.

Resolving the (Apparent) Talker Recognition Paradox in Developmental Speech Perception	INFANCY												The infant literature suggests that humans enter the world with impressive built-in talker processing abilities. For example, newborns prefer the sound of their mother's voice over the sound of another woman's voice, and well before their first birthday, infants tune in to language-specific speech cues for distinguishing between unfamiliar talkers. The early childhood literature, however, suggests that preschoolers are unable to learn to identify the voices of two unfamiliar talkers unless these voices are highly distinct from one another, and that adult-level talker recognition does not emerge until children near adolescence. How can we reconcile these apparently paradoxical messages conveyed by the infant and early childhood literatures? Here, we address this question by testing 16.5-month-old infants (N = 80) in three talker recognition experiments. Our results demonstrate that infants at this age have difficulty recognizing unfamiliar talkers, suggesting that talker recognition (associating voices with people) is mastered later in life than talker discrimination (telling voices apart). We conclude that methodological differences across the infant and early childhood literatures-rather than a true developmental discontinuity-account for the performance differences in talker processing between these two age groups. Related findings in other areas of developmental psychology are discussed.

Parental Linguistic Input and Its Relation to Toddlers' Visual Attention in Joint Object Play: A Comparison Between Children with Normal Hearing and Children With Hearing Loss	INFANCY												Parent-child interactions are multimodal, often involving coordinated exchanges of visual and auditory information between the two partners. The current work focuses on the effect of children's hearing loss on parent-child interactions when parents and their toddlers jointly played with a set of toy objects. We compared the linguistic input received by toddlers with hearing loss (HL) and their chronological age-matched (CA) and hearing age-matched (HA) normal-hearing peers. Moreover, we used head-mounted eye trackers to examine how different parental linguistic input affected children's visual attention on objects when parents either led or followed children's attention during joint object play. Overall, parents of children with HL provided comparable amount of linguistic input as parents of the two normal-hearing groups. However, the types of linguistic input produced by parents of children with HL were similar to the CA group in some ways and similar to the HA group in other ways. Interestingly, the effects of different types of linguistic input on extending the attention of children with HL qualitatively resembled the patterns seen in the CA group, even though the effects were less pronounced in the HL group. We discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of the reciprocal, dynamic, and multi-factored nature of parent-child interactions.

J	Schmidt, MFH; Rakoczy, H; Tomasello, M				Schmidt, Marco F. H.; Rakoczy, Hannes; Tomasello, Michael			Eighteen-Month-Old Infants Correct Non-Conforming Actions by Others	INFANCY												At around their third birthday, children begin to enforce social norms on others impersonally, often using generic normative language, but little is known about the developmental building blocks of this abstract norm understanding. Here, we investigate whether even toddlers show signs of enforcing on others interpersonally how "we" do things. In an initial dyad, 18-month-old infants learnt a simple game-like action from an adult. In two experiments, the adult either engaged infants in a normative interactive activity (stressing that this is the way "we" do it) or, as a non-normative control, marked the same action as idiosyncratic, based on individual preference. In a test dyad, infants had the opportunity to spontaneously intervene when a puppet partner performed an alternative action. Infants intervened, corrected, and directed the puppet more in the normative than in the non-normative conditions. These findings suggest that, during the second year of life, infants develop second-personal normative expectations about their partner's behavior ("You should do X!") in social interactions, thus making an important step toward understanding the normative structure of human cultural activities. These simple normative expectations will later be scaled up to group-minded and abstract social norms.						rakoczy, hannes/0000-0003-3296-0551; Schmidt, Marco F.

The Effects of Calibration Target, Screen Location, and Movement Type on Infant Eye-Tracking Data Quality	INFANCY												During infant eye-tracking, fussiness caused by the repetition of calibration stimuli and body movements during testing are frequent constraints on measurement quality. Here, we systematically investigated these constraints with infants and adults using EyeLink 1000 Plus. We compared looking time and dispersion of gaze points elicited by stimuli resembling commonly used calibration animations. The adult group additionally performed body movements during gaze recording that were equivalent to movements infants spontaneously produce during testing. In our results, infants' preference for a particular calibration target did not predict data quality elicited by that stimulus, but targets exhibiting the strongest contrasts in their center or targets with globally distributed complexity resulted in the highest accuracy. Our gaze measures from the adult movement tasks were differentially affected by the type of movement as well as the location where the target appeared on the screen. These heterogeneous effects of movement on measures should be taken into account when planning infant eye-tracking experiments. Additionally, to improve data quality, infants' tolerance for repeated calibrations can be facilitated by alternating between precise calibration targets.

Associations Between Maternal Postpartum Depression, Infant Social Behavior With a Stranger, and Infant Cognitive Development	INFANCY												Maternal postpartum depression (PPD) has been found to be related to infant social withdrawal during mother-infant interaction, and this may spill over on infant interactive behavior in other social contexts and impact infant psychosocial development. We investigated whether PPD was associated with infant social withdrawal during interaction with a tester in a psychological test situation and whether infant social withdrawal in the test situation mediated the association between PPD and infant cognitive scores reported in a previous study. Participants were 28 PPD dyads and 41 control dyads. We assessed infant social behavior and cognitive development with the Alarm Distress Baby Scale and the cognitive scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, third edition, at four months. More symptoms of maternal depression were associated with more infant social withdrawal. The association between maternal depressive symptoms and cognitive scores was at most partially mediated by infant social withdrawal in the test situation (<29.6%). Our results add to the existing literature on the effects of PPD on infant social behavior in other contexts than the one constituted by the mother. More research is needed to shed light on the mechanisms through which PPD impacts infant cognitive development.

Dutch but not English learners were affected by duration changes, even though distributions of short and long vowels in both languages are similar, and English uses vowel duration as a cue to (for example) consonant coda voicing. Additionally, we found that word recognition in Dutch toddlers was affected by shortening but not lengthening of vowels, matching an asymmetry also found in Dutch adults. Considering the subtlety of the cross-linguistic difference in the input, and the complexity of duration as a phonetic feature, our results suggest a strong capacity for phonetic analysis in children before their second birthday.

A word-object association task revealed that 18-month-old infants succeeded in learning the associations between two nonsense objects paired with two nonsense words minimally distinguished by pitch pattern (Experiment 1). In contrast, 14-month-old infants failed (Experiment 2). Eighteen-month-old infants succeeded even for sounds that contained only the prosodic information (Experiment 3). However, a subsequent experiment revealed that 14-month-old infants succeeded in an easier single word-object task using pitch contrast (Experiment 4). These findings indicate that pitch pattern information is robustly available to 18-month-old Japanese monolingual infants in a minimal pair word-learning situation, but only partially accessible in the same context for 14-month-old infants.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAY-JUN	2019	24	3					318	337		10.1111/infa.12279	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12279								32677192					WOS:000463026200002

Exploring in Silence: Hearing and Deaf Infants Explore Objects Differently Before Cochlear Implantation	INFANCY												Infant development has rarely been informed by the behavior of infants with sensory differences despite increasing recognition that infant behavior itself creates sensory learning opportunities. The purpose of this study of object exploration was to compare the behavior of hearing and deaf infants, with and without cochlear implants, in order to identify the effects of profound sensorineural hearing loss on infant exploration before cochlear implantation, the behavioral effects of access to auditory feedback after cochlear implantation, and the sensory motivation for exploration behaviors performed by hearing infants as well. The results showed that 9-month-old deaf infants explored objects as often as hearing infants but they used systematically different approaches and less variation before compared to after cochlear implantation. Potential associations between these early experiences and later learning are discussed in the context of embodied developmental theory, comparative studies, and research with adults. The data call for increased recognition of the active sensorimotor nature of infant learning and future research that investigates differences in sensorimotor experience as potential mechanisms in later learning and sequential memory development.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAY-JUN	2019	24	3					338	355		10.1111/infa.12281	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12281								31768147					WOS:000463026200003

In the visual preference task, infants visually preferred male faces, regardless of caregiver experience. Despite similarities in visual preferences, infants' attention toward females and males' internal facial features was related for infants with distributed caregiving only. Infants' performance across face processing tasks most often correlated for those with female primary caregivers. Results further our understanding of how infants with female primary caregivers display specialized processing of female faces, and how infants with distributed caregiving show similarities in their attention to female and male facial features.

The Development of Object Construction From Infancy Through Toddlerhood	INFANCY												Early in development, children explore and combine objects in increasingly complex ways. One manual skill, object construction, represents a major shift in how objects are explored relative to other objects. Despite recent connections with cognitive functioning such as spatial skills, the development of object construction ability has rarely been studied and its trajectory has not been adequately described. The purpose of this study was to describe the development of three types of object construction (stacking, nesting, and affixing) across 5 monthly infant visits and 7 monthly toddler visits using a longitudinal design and a large sample size. Infants (10-14 months, n = 131) and toddlers drawn from the infant sample (18-24 months, n = 65) were given sets of age-appropriate toys each of which elicited at least one type of constructive play. We described success at different construction tasks and identified trends for construction skill for infant and toddler development using multilevel modeling. We found that each of the three construction actions developed in unique ways across the 10- to 24-month period. Infant construction skill predicted the development of toddler skill, but toddler construction skill diverged from infant trajectories. We discuss the role of combination strategies in the development of object construction skill and how object construction could be related to other domains of development.

Six-Month-Old Infants Predict Agents' Goal-Directed Actions on Occluded Objects	INFANCY												Infants can infer agents' goals after observing agents' goal-directed actions on objects and can subsequently make predictions about how agents will act on objects in the future. We investigated the representations supporting these predictions. We familiarized 6-month-old infants to an agent who preferentially reached for one of two featurally distinct objects following a cue. At test, the objects were sequentially occluded from the infant in the agent's presence. We asked whether infants could generate action predictions without visual access to the relevant objects by measuring whether infants shifted their gaze to the location of the agent's hidden goal object following the cue. We also examined what infants represented about the hidden objects by removing one of the occluders to reveal either the original hidden object or the unexpected other object and measuring infants' looking time. We found that, even without visual access to the objects, infants made predictive gazes to the location of the agent's occluded goal object, but failed to represent the features of either hidden object. These results suggest that infants make goal-based action predictions when the relevant objects in the scene are occluded, but doing so may come at the expense of maintaining representations of the objects.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAY-JUN	2019	24	3					392	410		10.1111/infa.12282	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12282								32677190					WOS:000463026200006

Women pregnant during the Queensland floods in January 2011 completed measures of flood-related objective hardship and posttraumatic stress (PTS). At 16 months postpartum, mothers completed measures describing depressive symptoms and infant social-emotional and behavioral problems (n = 123) and competence (n = 125). Greater maternal PTS symptoms were associated with reduced infant competence. A sex difference in infant behavioral problems emerged at higher levels of maternal objective hardship and PTS; boys had significantly more behavioral problems than girls. Additionally, greater PTS was associated with more behavioral problems in boys; however, this effect was attenuated by adjustment for maternal depressive symptoms. No main effects or interactions with gestational timing were found. Findings highlight specificity in the relationships between PNMS components and infant outcomes and demonstrate that the effects of PNMS exposure on behavior may be evident as early as infancy. Implications for the support of families exposed to a natural disaster during pregnancy are discussed.

This behavior allows sharing attention and facilitates language acquisition and cognitive development. This article reviews studies that investigated gaze-following before 12 months of age in typically developing infants and discusses current theoretical perspectives on early GF. Recent research has revealed that early GF is highly dependent on situational constraints and individual characteristics, but theories that describe the underlying mechanisms have partly failed to consider this complexity. We propose a novel framework termed the perceptual narrowing account of GF that may have the potential to integrate existing theoretical accounts.

Recent studies of head camera wearing toddlers and their parents during object play have revealed that from toddlers' views, the referents of parents' object naming are often visually quite clear. Although these studies have promising theoretical implications, they were all conducted in stripped-down laboratory contexts. The current study examines the visual referential clarity of parents' object naming during play in the home. Results revealed patterns of visual referential clarity that resembled previous laboratory studies. Furthermore, context analyses show that such clarity is largely a product of manual activity rather than the object naming context.

Categorical Perception of Facial Emotions in Infancy	INFANCY												Categorical perception, indicated by superior discrimination between stimuli that cross categorical boundaries than between stimuli within a category, is an efficient manner of classification. The current study examined the development of categorical perception of emotional stimuli in infancy. We used morphed facial images to investigate whether infants find contrasts between emotional facial images that cross categorical boundaries to be more salient than those that do not, while matching the degree of differences in the two contrasts. Five-month-olds exhibited sensitivity to the categorical boundary between sadness and disgust, between happiness and surprise, as well as between sadness and anger but not between anger and disgust. Even 9-month-olds failed to exhibit evidence of a definitive category boundary between anger and disgust. These findings indicate the presence of discrete boundaries between some, but not all, of the basic emotions early in life. Implications of these findings for the major theories of emotion representation are discussed.

The Mini-Parent Reflective Functioning Interview (Mini-PRFI) assesses the parent's capacity to mentalize for his/her 6-month-old infant (rated using the PRF coding system; Slade et al., 2004, PRF coding system and Slade REF, Unpublished protocol, New York, NY: The City University of New York). In the current study, we examined whether Mini-PRFI scores were associated with theoretically related constructs; to establish a point of comparison, we evaluated links between Mini-PRFI scores alongside RF assessed from the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI). Mother-infant dyads (N = 88) completed the AAI before the birth of the infant, the Mini-PRFI and an interaction task (rated for insensitive parental behavior) when infants were 6 months old, as well as the Strange Situation Procedure when infants were 16 months old. Mini-PRFI scores were strongly positively associated with AAI RF and negatively associated with maternal insensitivity. Mini-PRFI scores predicted infant attachment organization (secure/insecure, organized/disorganized) at 16 months, and this effect was mediated by parenting insensitivity. These findings suggest that the Mini-PRFI predicts theoretically related attachment constructs, demonstrating the promise of the Mini-PRFI to increase the accessibility of interview-based PRF measurements to clinicians and researchers.

Mother-Infant Interaction and Child Brain Morphology: A Multidimensional Approach to Maternal Sensitivity	INFANCY												Emerging research suggests that normative variation in parenting quality relates to children's brain development. However, although the young brain is presumed to be especially sensitive to environmental influence, to our knowledge only two studies have examined parenting quality with infants as it relates to indicators of brain development, and both were cross-sectional. This longitudinal study investigated whether different components of maternal sensitivity in infancy predicted the volume of two brain structures presumed to be particularly sensitive to early experience, namely the amygdala and the hippocampus. Three dimensions of sensitivity (Cooperation/Attunement, Positivity, Accessibility/Availability) were observed in 33 mother-infant dyads at 1 year of age and children underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging at age 10. Higher maternal Accessibility/Availability during mother-infant interactions was found to be predictive of smaller right amygdala volume, while greater maternal positivity was predictive of smaller bilateral hippocampal volumes. These longitudinal findings extend those of previous cross-sectional studies and suggest that a multidimensional approach to maternal behavior could be a fruitful way to further advance research in this area, given that different facets of parenting might be differentially predictive of distinct aspects of neurodevelopment.

The Role of Dyadic Coordination in Organizing Visual Attention in 5-Month-Old Infants	INFANCY												In human infants, the ability to share attention with others is facilitated by increases in attentional selectivity and focus. Differences in early attention have been associated with socio-cognitive outcomes including language, yet the social mechanisms of attention organization in early infancy have only recently been considered. Here, we examined how social coordination between 5-month-old infants and caregivers relate to differences in infant attention, including looking preferences, span, and reactivity to caregivers' social cues. Using a naturalistic play paradigm, we found that 5-month-olds who received a high ratio of sensitive (jointly focused) contingent responses showed strong preferences for objects with which their caregivers were manually engaged. In contrast, infants whose caregivers exhibited high ratios of redirection (attempts to shift focus) showed no preferences for caregivers' held objects. Such differences have implications for recent models of cognitive development, which rely on early looking preferences for adults' manually engaged objects as a pathway toward joint attention and word learning. Further, sensitivity and redirectiveness predicted infant attention even in reaction to caregiver responses that were non-referential (neither sensitive nor redirective). In response to non-referentials, infants of highly sensitive caregivers oriented less frequently than infants of highly redirective caregivers, who showed increased distractibility. Our results suggest that specific dyadic exchanges predict infant attention differences toward broader social cues, which may have consequences for social-cognitive outcomes.

Changing Opportunities for Learning in Everyday Life: Infant Body Position Over the First Year	INFANCY												Developmental theories depend on characterizing the input to potential learning mechanisms-infants' everyday experiences. The current study employed a novel ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to measure two aspects of the physical context of those experiences: body position and location. Infant body position was selected because it relates to the development of a variety of other skills. Caregivers of 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month-olds reported infants' body position-held, supine, reclined, prone, sitting, or upright-in response to text message notifications over a week to capture infants' experiences across the entire range of their daily activities. Findings revealed a tremendous disparity in the distribution of body position experiences over the first year. Younger infants spend more time held, supine, and reclined, whereas older infants spend more time sitting and upright. Body position experiences differed substantially between same-age infants who possess a motor skill (e.g., ability to sit or walk) compared with those who did not, suggesting that developing motor skills change infants' everyday experiences. Finally, the success of the methodology suggests that similar EMAs might be used to study a wide range of infants' naturalistic experiences.

INFANCY												Gestures are the first signs of intentional communication within prelinguistic infants and can reflect various motives, including a declarative motive to share attention and interest. The ability to use gestures declaratively has been linked to later language development; therefore, it is important to understand the origins of this motive. Previous research has focused on the use of declarative pointing at around 12 months; however, other potential forms of declarative communication, such as holdout gestures, are yet to be studied in detail. The purpose of this study was to examine whether from 10 months, infants use holdouts declaratively. We elicited holdouts from 36 infants and then reacted to these gestures in four different conditions: (1) joint attention: shared interest; (2) infant attention: attended to infant; (3) toy attention: attended to toy; (4) ignore: gesture was not attended to. Infants' behavioral responses were recorded. When the experimenter engaged in joint attention, infants were significantly more likely to display a positive attitude and produced fewer re-engagement attempts. In contrast, the three non-joint attention conditions displayed significantly higher negative attitudes and attempts to re-engage the experimenter. We conclude that infants display declarative communication prior to 12 months, resetting the age at which these more complex skills emerge.

Participants were 137 at-risk mothers and their children participating in a longitudinal study of intergenerational transmission of risk. Mothers' depression was measured five times during the infants' first 18 months. Infant cortisol was collected during a social stressor (the still-face paradigm) when infants were 6 months old, and mothers reported on toddlers' internalizing and externalizing symptoms at 18 months. Among this sample of high-risk mother-infant dyads, early postpartum depression predicted atypical infant cortisol reactivity at 6 months, which mediated the effect of maternal depression on increased toddler behavior problems. Clinical implications are discussed.

Infants' Biological Sensitivity to the Effects of Maternal Social Support: Evidence Among Mexican American Families	INFANCY												The identification of infants who are most susceptible to both negative and positive social environments is critical for understanding early behavioral development. This study longitudinally assessed the interactive effects of infant vagal tone (respiratory sinus arrhythmia; RSA) and maternal social support on behavioral problems and competence among 322 low-income Mexican American mother-infant dyads (infants: 54.1% female) and explored sex differences. Infant RSA was calculated from resting HR data at 6 weeks of age. Mothers reported on general social support, partner support, and family support at 6 months, and infant behavioral problems and competence at 1 year. Two-way interactions (RSA x support source) were evaluated to predict behavioral problems and competence, adjusting for covariates. Results indicated higher competence among infants with lower RSA whose mothers reported higher general support or higher partner support. Interactive effects on behavior problems of RSA with maternal partner or family support were only found for female infants: Girls with higher RSA showed more behavior problems when mothers reported low support, but fewer problem levels in the context of high support. Our results suggest that infant RSA is an important moderator of the effects of the early social environment on early development.

J	Campbell, J; Graham, S; Curtin, S				Campbell, Jennifer; Graham, Susan; Curtin, Suzanne			Word Level Stress and Lexical Processing in 17-Month-Old Infants	INFANCY												Detailed representations enable infants to distinguish words from one another and more easily recognize new words. We examined whether 17-month-old infants encode word stress in their familiar word representations. In Experiment 1, infants were presented with pairs of familiar objects while hearing a target label either properly pronounced with the correct stress (e.g., baby /'beibi/) or mis-pronounced with the incorrect stress pattern (e.g., baby /bei'bi/). Infants mapped both the correctly stressed and mis-stressed labels to the target objects; however, they were slower to fixate the target when hearing the mis-stressed label. In Experiment 2, we examined whether infants appreciate that stress has a nonproductive role in English (i.e., altering the stress of a word does not typically signal a change in word meaning) by presenting infants with a familiar object paired with a novel object while hearing either correctly stressed or mis-stressed familiar words (Experiment 2). Here, infants mapped the correctly stressed label to the familiar object but did not map the mis-stressed label reliably to either the target or distractor objects. These findings suggest that word stress impacts the processing of familiar words, and infants have burgeoning knowledge that altering the stress pattern of a familiar word does not reliably signal a new referent.

Predisposing Factors for Elevated Restricted and Repetitive Behavior in Typically Developing Toddlers	INFANCY												Little is known about the relation between levels of restricted and repetitive behavior (RRB) in infants and parent factors. The present study investigated maternal and psychosocial factors (depressive symptoms, socio-economic status, social support) and mother-infant engagement factors (mind-mindedness, sensitivity, and infant-mother attachment security) as predictors of children's RRB at age 26 months in a sample of 206 mothers and children. Maternal depressive symptoms predicted levels of sensory and motor repetitive behavior and rigid, routinized, and ritualistic repetitive behavior. Lower socioeconomic status also predicted independent variance in children's sensory and motor repetitive behavior. The relations between maternal depressive symptoms and both types of RRB were not mediated through observational measures of maternal sensitivity or mind-mindedness at 8 months, or attachment security at 15 months. The results are discussed in terms of whether stress regulation, self-stimulation, and genetic susceptibility can help explain the observed link between maternal depressive symptoms and RRB in the child.					; Meins, Elizabeth/K-5429-2015	Larkin, Fionnuala/0000-0003-3838-9165; Meins, Elizabeth/0000-0002-5375-6448													1525-0008	1532-7078				JAN-FEB	2019	24	1					24	42		10.1111/infa.12264	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12264								32677263					WOS:000454512000003

This study investigated a longitudinal model of infant frontotemporal electroencephalogram (EEG) coherence predicting toddler inhibition, which then predicted childhood social responsiveness. A structural equation model showed good fit, with increased right hemisphere frontotemporal EEG coherence predicting less inhibition at age 2, which in turn predicted less social responsiveness at age 4. These findings support the hypothesis that infant frontotemporal connectivity is indirectly associated with later social behavior, with toddler inhibition as a potential mechanism.

Second-Order Correlation Learning of Dynamic Stimuli: Evidence from Infants and Computational Modeling	INFANCY												We present two habituation experiments that examined 20- and 26-month-olds' ability to engage in second-order correlation learning for static and dynamic features, whereby learned associations between two pairs of features (e.g., P and Q, P and R) are generalized to the features that were not presented together (e.g., Q and R). We also present results from an associative learning mechanism that was implemented as an autoencoder parallel distributed processing (PDP) network in which second-order correlation learning is shown to be an emergent property of the dynamics of the network. The experiments and simulation demonstrate that 20- and 26-month-olds as well as neural networks are capable of second-order correlation learning in a category context for internal features of dynamic objects. However, the model predicts-and Experiment 3 demonstrates-that 20- and 26-month-olds are unable to encode second-order correlations in a noncategory context for dynamic objects with internal features. It is proposed that the ability to learn second-order correlations represents a powerful but as yet unexplored process for generalization in the first years of life.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				JAN-FEB	2019	24	1					57	78		10.1111/infa.12274	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12274								32677258					WOS:000454512000005

In this study, GF was assessed while changing the space between an actor's eyes and the gaze target. This was done to address a potential confound in the gold standard GF performance test, namely the spatial bias of the actors' eye position that occurs when the actor turns the head to look at a target, offsetting the eye position from a centered position toward the attended target. Our results suggest that both 4.5 (n = 27) and 6 (n = 30)-month-old infants can follow an actor's gaze regardless of proximity. This is the first demonstration that early GF is not dependent on proximity cues, and our results strengthen previous findings suggesting that GF develops well before 6 months of age. The study was preregistered, and all data and analysis routines can be downloaded with provided links.

Maternal education influences Australian infants' language experience from six months	INFANCY												Disparities in children's early language skills associated with socioeconomic factors have led to many studies examining children's early language environments, but few as yet in the first year of life. This longitudinal study assessed the home language environments of 50 Australian infants, who varied in maternal education (university education, or not). Full-day audio recordings were collected and analyzed using the LENA system when infants were aged 6-9 months and 12-15 months. Using the device-specific analysis software, we assessed 12-h projected counts of (1) adult speech input, (2) conversational interactions, and (3) child vocalizations. At both ages, higher maternal education was associated with higher counts of adult words and conversational turns, but not child vocalizations. The study adds to the literature by demonstrating disparities in the infants' language experience within the first year of life, related to mothers' education, with implications for early intervention and parenting supports.

We use naturalistic data to analyze the productive vocabulary of 44 17-month-olds in relation to mothers' work status (full time, part time, stay at home) at 6 and 18 months. Infants who experienced a combination of care from mothers and other caretakers had larger productive vocabularies than infants in solely full-time maternal or solely other-caretaker care. Our results draw from naturalistic data to suggest that this care combination may be particularly beneficial for early lexical development.

Playdates: A Win-Win-Win Strategy for Recruitment of Infant Participants	INFANCY												High-quality developmental science requires a reliable and representative stream of participants, yet recruiting infants at a satisfactory rate can be challenging. We recently developed a new recruitment technique: we invite parents to sign up for no-strings-attached playdates in our laboratory, where we provide toys, free coffee, and students to help entertain the children. We have consistently hosted 2-3 new parents per week via playdates. Approximately 88% of attending parents agreed to be contacted later about research, and 81% of those contacted returned for research appointments. This method has doubled the number of participants we run per week, improved our rapport with the local community, and provided an enhanced educational opportunity for students in our laboratory. We hope others find it similarly transformative.

J	Rogers, M; Franklin, A; Knoblauch, K				Rogers, Marie; Franklin, Anna; Knoblauch, Kenneth			A Novel Method to Investigate How Dimensions Interact to Inform Perceptual Salience in Infancy	INFANCY												How physical dimensions govern children's perception, language acquisition, and cognition is an important question in developmental science. Here, we use the psychophysical technique of maximum likelihood conjoint measurement (MLCM) as a novel approach to investigate how infants combine information distributed along two or more dimensions. MLCM is based on a signal detection model of decision that allows testing of several models of how observers integrate information to make choices. We tested 6-month-old infants' preferential looking to "green" stimuli that covaried in lightness and chroma and analyzed infant preferences using MLCM. The findings show that infant looking is driven primarily by lightness, with darker stimuli having a greater preference than lighter, plus a small but significant positive contribution of chroma. This study demonstrates that the technique of MLCM can be used in conjunction with preferential looking to investigate the salience of physical dimensions during development. The technique could now be applied to investigate the role of physical dimensions in key aspects of perceptual and cognitive development such as face recognition, language acquisition, and object recognition.

J	Kidd, E; Junge, C; Spokes, T; Morrison, L; Cutler, A				Kidd, Evan; Junge, Caroline; Spokes, Tara; Morrison, Lauren; Cutler, Anne			Individual Differences in Infant Speech Segmentation: Achieving the Lexical Shift	INFANCY												We report a large-scale electrophysiological study of infant speech segmentation, in which over 100 English-acquiring 9-month-olds were exposed to unfamiliar bisyllabic words embedded in sentences (e.g., He saw a wild eagle up there), after which their brain responses to either the just-familiarized word (eagle) or a control word (coral) were recorded. When initial exposure occurs in continuous speech, as here, past studies have reported that even somewhat older infants do not reliably recognize target words, but that successful segmentation varies across children. Here, we both confirm and further uncover the nature of this variation. The segmentation response systematically varied across individuals and was related to their vocabulary development. About one-third of the group showed a left-frontally located relative negativity in response to familiar versus control targets, which has previously been described as a mature response. Another third showed a similarly located positive-going reaction (a previously described immature response), and the remaining third formed an intermediate grouping that was primarily characterized by an initial response delay. A fine-grained group-level analysis suggested that a developmental shift to a lexical mode of processing occurs toward the end of the first year, with variation across individual infants in the exact timing of this shift.

This, however, ignores the potentially useful role that intonation, another aspect of prosody, might play in aiding discrimination. In this article, we investigated how and when American English-learning infants discriminate between prosodically similar languages, specifically American English and German, focusing on the role of intonation in infant language discrimination. We found that the ability to distinguish American English and German develops between 5 and 7 months. However, 7-month-olds failed to discriminate the two languages when the natural pitch variation was replaced by a monotone. Thus, intonation is necessary for infants' discrimination of American English and German. Based on these results, we argue for a greater role of intonation in supporting language discrimination by infants.

We examined whether 2-year-olds (N = 28) are already able to track spatial rotations (i.e., by 90 degrees and 180 degrees) if the task is facilitated by increasing the visual discriminability of the hiding containers by means of different shapes and different colors. Children performed above chance level in all conditions except for the condition in which containers had the same color and shape and were rotated by 180 degrees. Moreover, children found the hidden object more often when the containers had different-as compared to identical-shapes, whereas performance was similar when the containers had the same or different colors. Furthermore, their performance was better after 90 degrees rotations than after 180 degrees rotations and children in all conditions showed an inhibition bias. Our findings suggest that 2-year-olds are already able to track spatial rotations if the task is kept simple and focuses solely on the ability of interest. In addition, young children use shape-rather than color-as a salient dimension in spatial rotation tasks.

Maternal PEM and mind-mindedness were assessed at 8 months (N = 206), and infant attachment security was assessed at 15 months. PEM was positively correlated with appropriate mind-related comments and was unrelated to nonattuned mind-related comments. Multinomial regression analyses showed that higher PEM distinguished between secure versus insecure-avoidant infants and between insecure-resistant versus insecure-avoidant infants over and above the contributions of appropriate and nonattuned mind-related comments. These results suggest that both verbal and nonverbal indices of parental mentalizing make independent contributions in predicting the security of the infant-mother attachment relationship.

J	McMahon, C; Newey, B				McMahon, Catherine; Newey, Brooklyn			Non-Attuned Mind-Mindedness, Infant Negative Affect, and Emotional Availability: Assessing Mind-Mindedness during the Still-Face Paradigm	INFANCY												Mind-mindedness captures caregiver orientation to infant mental states expressed in mind-related comments to infant cues, typically assessed during free play. There are two orthogonal dimensions: Appropriate comments accurately interpret the infant's experience, and non-attuned comments are judged by observers to be inaccurate interpretations. Appropriate comments have been consistently associated with optimal caregiving behavior, but less is known about non-attuned comments, rare during free play. Further, available evidence suggests mind-mindedness is independent of infant temperament, but few studies have examined relations between mind-mindedness and infant behavior during real-time interaction. We addressed these issues using the Still-Face Paradigm. Participants were 76 mothers and their 7-month-old infants. Mind-mindedness, emotional availability, and infant negative affect were independently coded. Unexpectedly, appropriate mind-related comments were not associated with emotional availability nor with infant negative affect. Mothers who made non-attuned comments showed lower emotional availability, and their infants showed more extreme responses to the still-faceeither no negative affect or crying. Infants whose mothers made non-attuned comments early showed less recovery in reunion episodes. Infant negative affect in early episodes also influenced mind-related comments; mothers whose infants showed no negative affect made fewer appropriate comments in later episodes. Implications of assessing mind-mindedness in stress contexts are discussed.

The aim of this study was to examine the influence of mother-infant and partner-infant bonding, mental ill-health and substance use at 8 weeks postbirth on mother-infant and partner-infant EA at 12 months postbirth, accounting for a range of demographic and postnatal variables. Participants were 191 matched mother-partner-infant triads from a nested sample of an Australian longitudinal pregnancy cohort (The Triple B Pregnancy Cohort). Assessments were conducted at 8 weeks postbirth and at infant age 12 months. Parental EA was coded from dyadic interactions during a 20-min free play observational video recorded at 12 months. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis, accounting for within-dyad clustering, showed older parent age was associated with higher parent-child EA scores (chi(2) = 6.28, p < .01), while parental tobacco use (chi(2) = 7.35, p < .01) and depression (chi(2) = 4.51, p < .05) at 8 weeks postnatal predicted poorer parent-child EA scores at 12 months. These novel findings suggest that it may be particularly important to support young couples and those struggling with symptoms of depression or tobacco use during the postnatal period.

Using automatic eye tracking, we assessed categorization through the alternating/nonalternating paradigm. For infants in the bimodal condition, their average dwell time was larger for alternating trials than for nonalternating trials, while infants in the unimodal condition initially looked equally long at both types of trials. This group difference suggests that the shape of frequency distribution bears on the number of categories that infants construct from a continuum. Later in test, all infants show this alternating preference. We conclude that categorization is a flexible process, continuously adjusting itself to additional input.

Evidence for such processes has been shown in adults, but little previous work has examined whether infants show similar patterns. To examine this, we measured physiological arousal in 57 typical 12month olds while presenting a 20-min mixed viewing battery. Fluctuations in autonomic arousal were measured via heart rate, electrodermal activity, and movement. We reasoned that if transitions in autonomic arousal are random (stochastic), then (1) arousal would be normally distributed across the session, and (2) episodes where arousal exceeded a certain threshold above the mean should be as long-lived as those where arousal exceeded the same threshold below the mean. In fact we found that (1) heart rate and movement (but not electrodermal activity) were positively skewed, and (2) that increases in arousal have a lower extinction probability than decreases in arousal. Our findings may suggest that increases in arousal are self-sustaining. These patterns are the opposite of the homeostatic mechanisms predicted by naive approaches to emotion regulation.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				SEP-OCT	2018	23	5					628	649		10.1111/infa.12243	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12243													WOS:000440923100001

Research has shown that both motor and social deficits are observed in infants who later develop autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study examined associations between motor and Social communication skills in 12-month-old infant siblings of children with ASD who are at heightened risk for developmental delays (N=86) and low-risk, typically developing infants (N=113). Infants were classified into one of three groups based on their walking ability: walkers (walks independently), standers (stands independently), or prewalkers (does not yet stand or walk independently). Social communication and cognitive skills were assessed with two standardized assessments (Communication and Symbolic Behaviors Scales [CSBS] and Mullen Scales of Early Learning) and compared across the three walking groups. Results demonstrated that high-risk walkers showed superior Social communication skills, but commensurate cognitive skills, compared to high-risk prewalkers. In contrast, Social communication and cognitive skills were largely comparable for low-risk infants, regardless of walking status. Findings suggest that for high-risk infants, who are already vulnerable to developmental delays and ASD, independent walking may facilitate the emergence of Social communication abilities. Pivotal motor milestones may serve as useful indicators of Social communication delays and targets for intervention.

Evaluating Caregiver Sensitivity to Infants: Measures Matter	INFANCY												The significance of caregiver sensitivity for child development has been debated among scholars, not least due to sensitivity's inconsistent predictive value over time and across contexts. A lack of uniformity in the definition of sensitivity contributes to this debate, but shortfalls of intertool concordance and construct validity in the instruments used to assess sensitivity may also be at issue. This study examines correspondences among four established standardized measures of caregiver sensitivity in independent classifications of the same sample of mothers of infants. Fifty European American mother-infant dyads of diverse SES were independently assessed with three observational caregiver sensitivity measures: the Emotional Availability Scales (EAS; Biringen, 2008, Emotional availability (EA) scales manual (4th ed.): Part 1. Infancy/early childhood version (child aged 0-5years). Colorado State University. Unpublished manuscript), the Parent Child InteractionNursing Child Assessment Satellite Training Feeding Scale (PCI-NCAFS; Oxford & Findlay, NCAST caregiver/parent-child interaction feeding manual, Seattle, WA: NCAST Programs, University of Washington, School of Nursing, 2015), and the Maternal Behavior Q-Sort (MBQS; Moran, Pederson, & Bento, 2009, Maternal Behavior Q-Sort (MBQS)-Overview, available materials and support. University of Western Ontario. Unpublished). Ratings were juxtaposed with classifications of the same sample based on the original Ainsworth Maternal Sensitivity Scales (AMSS; Ainsworth, 1969, Power, 6, 1379). The EAS, NCAFS, and MBQS are related to the AMSS, but large proportions of variance were unshared. Researchers and clinicians should be cautious when assuming that popular observational assessment instruments, commonly believed to measure a generic construct of caregiver sensitivity, are interchangeable, as these measures may evaluate different features of sensitivity to infants.

Infants Use Category Label Knowledge to Interpret Absent Reference	INFANCY												This research investigated infants' (16 and 20months) use of category information in responding to references to absent objects. Infants were asked to find an object in the box (e.g., Find an apple!). When allowed to search, they found either an object from the mentioned category (a plastic apple) or a different object. Infants in both age groups searched again in the box trying to find another object more often on nonreferent than on referent trials (Experiment 1). However, when nonreferents were categorically related to referents, only older infants detected a mismatch and searched again (Experiment 2). These findings suggest that infants use category knowledge when processing references to absent objects.

Infants Discriminate the Affective Expressions of their Peers: The Roles of Age and Familiarization Time	INFANCY												Research examining infants' discrimination of affect often uses unfamiliar faces and voices of adults. Recently, research has examined infant discrimination of affect in familiar faces and voices. In much of this research, infants were habituated to the affective expressions using a standard 50% habituation criterion. We extend this line of research by examining infants' discrimination of unfamiliar peers', that is, 4-month-olds, dynamic, facial, and vocal affective expressions and assessing how discrimination is affected by changing the habituation criterion. In two experiments, using an infant-controlled habituation design, we explored 3- and 5-month-olds' discrimination of their peers' dynamic audiovisual displays of positive and negative expressions of affect. Results of Experiment 1, using a 50% habituation criterion, revealed that 5-month-olds, but not 3-month-olds discriminated the affective expressions of their peers. In Experiment 2, we examined whether 3-month-olds' lack of discrimination in Experiment 1 was a result of insufficient habituation (i.e., familiarization). Specifically, 3-month-olds were habituated using a 70% habituation criterion, providing them with longer familiarization time. Results revealed that using the more stringent habituation criterion, 3-month-olds showed longer habituation times, that is increased familiarization, and discriminated their peers' affective expressions. Results are discussed in terms of infants' discrimination of affect, the role of familiarization time, and limitations of the 50% habituation criterion.

Development of Infant Pointing from 10 to 12months: The Role of Relevant Caregiver Responsiveness	INFANCY												Infants' pointing frequency is a predictor of their later language abilities. Yet, predictors of pointing frequency in the first year of life are not well understood. Study 1 explored what factors in infants and caregivers at 10months would predict the pointing frequency of infants at 12months (N=35). Infant-driven predictors were infants' fine-motor skills and point-following abilities. Caregiver-mediated predictors were caregivers' pointing frequency and responsiveness toward infants' pointing. Relevant caregiver responsiveness at 10months predicted infants' pointing frequency at 12months, controlling for the other factors and infants' prior pointing frequency. Study 2 explored whether child-level factors influence caregivers' responsiveness (N=49). We examined the hand shape of infants' pointing (whole-hand versus index-finger) and the presence of point-accompanying vocalizations. Infants' vocalization-accompanied points were more likely to elicit relevant responses from caregivers, while hand shapes played a less pronounced role. Together, the findings reveal an early emerging mutual relationship between infant pointing and caregiver behavior such that certain characteristics of infant pointing predict caregivers' responsiveness, and relevant responsiveness toward infants' pointing predicts the increase in infants' pointing frequencies.

The Influence of Maternal Socialization on Infants' Social Evaluation in Two Cultures	INFANCY												Although a growing body of research has explored the early development of social evaluation, no research has directly compared social evaluations of infants between different cultures. In addition, there has been little understanding regarding socialization's effects on this ability. The goal of this study was to expand on earlier findings on social evaluation in infants by investigating a broader sample from two cultures, and to explore the influence of maternal socialization on infants' social evaluation. Using the violation of expectations and the preferential reaching paradigm, four groups aged 6-, 9-, 12-, and 15-18months and their mothers from Japan and the United States (159 dyads) were compared in terms of spontaneous social evaluations. Japanese and European American infants showed similar performance in dishabituation to the inconsistent behavior and in their reaching preference for prosocial over antisocial agents, indicating that the emergence of spontaneous social evaluation is not culture-specific. Furthermore, our study provides a novel finding regarding the relationship between mothers' socially evaluative speech and infants' preference for prosocial over antisocial agents. These results suggest that the development of sociomoral understanding results from complicated interactions among evolutionary, cognitive, and social factors.

J	Bergmann, C; Cristia, A				Bergmann, Christina; Cristia, Alejandrina			Environmental Influences on Infants' Native Vowel Discrimination: The Case of Talker Number in Daily Life	INFANCY												Both quality and quantity of speech from the primary caregiver have been found to impact language development. A third aspect of the input has been largely ignored: the number of talkers who provide input. Some infants spend most of their waking time with only one person; others hear many different talkers. Even if the very same words are spoken the same number of times, the pronunciations can be more variable when several talkers pronounce them. Is language acquisition affected by the number of people who provide input? To shed light on the possible link between how many people provide input in daily life and infants' native vowel discrimination, three age groups were tested: 4-month-olds (before attunement to native vowels), 6-month-olds (at the cusp of native vowel attunement) and 12-month-olds (well attuned to the native vowel system). No relationship was found between talker number and native vowel discrimination skills in 4- and 6-month-olds, who are overall able to discriminate the vowel contrast. At 12months, we observe a small positive relationship, but further analyses reveal that the data are also compatible with the null hypothesis of no relationship. Implications in the context of infant language acquisition and cognitive development are discussed.

Dyads were video-recorded during book-sharing and play. Videos were coded for the timing of infants' vocalizations and gestures and mothers' referential language (i.e., statements that inform infants about objects and events in the world; e.g., That's a big doggy!), regulatory language (i.e., statements that regulate infants' attention or actions; e.g., Look at that, Put it down!), and gestures. Infants of all three ethnicities responded within 3sec of mothers' language and gestures, increased their responsiveness over development, and displayed specificity in their responses: They vocalized and gestured following mothers' referential language and gestures, but were less likely than chance to communicate following mothers' regulatory language. At an individual level, responsive infants had responsive mothers.

J	Filippetti, ML; Tsakiris, M				Filippetti, Maria Laura; Tsakiris, Manos			Just Before I Recognize Myself: The Role of Featural and Multisensory Cues Leading up to Explicit Mirror Self-Recognition	INFANCY												Leading up to explicit mirror self-recognition, infants rely on two crucial sources of information: the continuous integration of sensorimotor and multisensory signals, as when seeing one's movements reflected in the mirror, and the unique facial features associated with the self. While visual appearance and multisensory contingent cues may be two likely candidates of the processes that enable self-recognition, their respective contribution remains poorly understood. In this study, 18-month-old infants saw side-by-side pictures of themselves and a peer, which were systematically and simultaneously touched on the face with a hand. While watching the stimuli, the infant's own face was touched either in synchrony or out of synchrony and their preferential looking behavior was measured. Subsequently, the infants underwent the mirror-test task. We demonstrated that infants who were coded as nonrecognizers at the mirror test spent significantly more time looking at the picture of their own face compared to the other-face, irrespective of whether the multisensory input was synchronous or asynchronous. Our results suggest that right before the onset of mirror self-recognition, featural information about the self might be more relevant in the process of recognizing one's face, compared to multisensory cues.

J	Loucks, J; Sommerville, J				Loucks, Jeff; Sommerville, Jessica			Developmental Change in Action Perception: Is Motor Experience the Cause?	INFANCY												Human actions are complex stimuli containing several perceptual dimensions an observer could attend to. Research indicates that attention to the perceptual dimensions of action undergoes a process of perceptual narrowing between 4 and 10months, during which infants' attention to configural and temporal information in action decreases over time, while attention to hand information is maintained. This research explored whether infants' active experience with grasping is related to perceptual narrowing in action. Across two studies, we tested 6-month-old infants' attention to changes in these action dimensions and also assessed their grasping ability. Infants who were more proficient at grasping showed a pattern more consistent with perceptual narrowing (decreasing attention to configural and temporal information) relative to those less proficient at grasping, especially for attention to configural information. In addition, attention to hand information appears to undergo U-shaped development between 4 and 10months, as 6-month-olds did not recover attention to the hand change. These findings add to a growing body of research showing that infants' motor experience broadly influences their perception of others' action and may follow a complex developmental pathway that diverges from perceptual narrowing over the first year.

Maternal Into-The-Face Behavior, Shared Attention, and Infant Distress During Face-to-Face Play at 12 Months: Bi-directional Contingencies	INFANCY												We describe a new maternal intrusion behavior, moving a toy or hand into-the-face of the infant, and we investigate its bi-directional associations with infant-initiated shared attention, infant distress, and infant gaze, during mother-infant face-to-face play at 12months. The play was videotaped split-screen, with infants seated in a high chair. Videotapes were coded on a 1-sec time base for mother and infant gaze (at partner, toy, both, or gaze away); infant distress; and maternal intrusion behavior, into-the-face. We defined infant-initiated shared attention as mother and infant looking in the same second at a toy that the infant-initiated interest in. We documented that maternal into-the-face behavior decreased the likelihood of infant-initiated shared attention, increased the likelihood of infant distress, and decreased the likelihood of infant gazing away. Reciprocally, infant distress and gazing away increased the likelihood of mother into-the-face. In moments when the dyad was engaged in infant-initiated shared attention, mother into-the-face was less likely. This work documents bi-directional contingencies in the regulation of maternal intrusion and infant behavior during face-to-face play at 12months. We suggest that mother into-the-face behavior disturbs an aspect of the infant's experience of recognition.

Pragmatic Opportunities for Language Development in Strollers versus Backpacks	INFANCY												Strollers and backpacks are employed early, frequently, and throughout the first year, with parents overwhelmingly using strollers. However, because these transport modalities put infants in different proximities to caregivers, postures, and states of alertness, their use may translate to different opportunities that are of developmental consequence, particularly with regard to language. We used GoPro technology in a within-subjects counterbalanced design to measure dyadic vocalizations in strollers and backpacks with 7- to 11-month-old infants. Parent-infant dyads (N=36) who regularly used both transport modes took two 8-min walks in their own neighborhoods using their own carriers while wearing lightweight head-mounted GoPros. There was significantly more parent speech, infant vocalizations, dyadic conversations, and infant-initiated speech in backpacks, as well as more head motion consistent with visual scanning by infants. Backpacks appear to be a practical way to encourage more engaging, language-enriched developmental opportunities in the critical first year.

Seventy mothers and their 3-month-old infants were observed during the Still-Face Paradigm (SFP). Maternal sensitivity and IDS prosody were assessed at baseline and infant negative affect in the baseline, still-face, and reunion episodes. Results showed that prototypical IDS prosody characterized by wider fundamental frequency (F0) variability was related to decreases in infant's negative affect, but only if accompanied by maternal sensitivity. Infants of sensitive mothers who spoke with more prototypical IDS prosody showed better abilities to regulate negative affect during the SFP. When prototypical IDS prosody was accompanied by low maternal sensitivity, infants showed lower regulation of negative emotions. In conclusion, infant negative affect regulation in a dyadic setting is facilitated by an optimal combination of both more prototypical maternal IDS prosody and maternal sensitive responsiveness. Implications for the study of mother-infant interaction are discussed.

Two moderation models were tested on a sample of 134 families with 6-month-old infants (77 low-risk preterm, 57 full-term). Cumulative stressful contexts mitigated the relations between maternal mentalization and behavior, such that online maternal mentalization during mother-infant interaction was related to both maternal sensitivity and the quality of family triadic interaction under low cumulative stressful contexts, but not under high cumulative stressful contexts.

J	Piantadosi, ST; Palmeri, H; Aslin, R				Piantadosi, Steven T.; Palmeri, Holly; Aslin, Richard			Limits on Composition of Conceptual Operations in 9-Month-Olds	INFANCY												Complex systems are often built from a relatively small set of basic features or operations that can be combined in myriad ways. We investigated the developmental origins of this compositional architecture in 9-month-old infants, extending recent work that demonstrated rudimentary compositional abilities in preschoolers. Infants viewed two separate object-occlusion events that depicted a single-feature-change operation. They were then tested with a combined operation to determine whether they expected the outcome of the two feature changes, even though this combination was unfamiliar. In contrast to preschoolers, infants did not appear to predictively compose these simple feature-change operations. A second experiment demonstrated the ability of infants to track two operations when not combined. The failure to compose basic operations is consistent with limitations on object tracking and early numerical cognition (Feigenson & Yamaguchi, Infancy, 2009, 14, 244). We suggest that these results can be unified via a general principle: Infants have difficulty with multiple updates to a representation of an unobservable.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAY-JUN	2018	23	3					310	324		10.1111/infa.12225	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12225								32884496					WOS:000430107000001

Face Preferences for Infant- and Adult-Directed Speakers in Infants of Depressed and Nondepressed Mothers: Association with Infant Cognitive Development	INFANCY												Face preferences for speakers of infant-directed and adult-directed speech (IDS and ADS) were investigated in 4- to 13.5-month-old infants of depressed and nondepressed mothers. Following 1min of exposure to an ID or AD speaker (order counterbalanced), infants had an immediate paired-comparison test with a still, silent image of the familiarized versus a novel face. In the test phase, ID face preference ratios were significantly lower in infants of depressed than nondepressed mothers. Infants' ID face preference ratios, but not AD face preference ratios, correlated with their percentile scores on the cognitive (Cog) scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant & Toddler Development (3rd Edition; BSID-III), assessed concurrently. Regression analyses revealed that infant ID face preferences significantly predicted infant Cog percentiles even after demographic risk factors and maternal depression had been controlled. Infants may use IDS to select social partners who are likely to support and facilitate cognitive development.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAY-JUN	2018	23	3					325	341		10.1111/infa.12224	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12224								29773970					WOS:000430107000002
J	Lany, J; Giglio, M; Oswald, M				Lany, Jill; Giglio, Michael; Oswald, Madeleine			Infants' Lexical Processing Efficiency is Related to Vocabulary Size by One Year of Age	INFANCY												By 15-18months, infants' skill in interpreting familiar words, or lexical processing efficiency (LPE), improves substantially and is correlated with vocabulary size concurrently and several months later. Prior to this age LPE is quite poor, and to date there is little evidence that it is related to vocabulary size. If this relation only emerges once infants have relatively good LPE, and also know a substantial number of words, it could suggest that the processes that support the rapid growth in vocabulary commonly observed as infants approach age 2 may not yet be functional in the earlier stages of lexical development. However, using a modified LPE task we found that 12-month-olds with better LPE understood more words at that age and also produced more words several months later. These results suggest that meaningful individual differences in LPE are already emerging by 12months and may support lexical development across the second year.

Mother-infant dyads engaged in the Still-Face Task when infants were 5months, on the cusp of the active emergence of social bidding during the still-face phase of the task. Maternal mirroring of infants' behavior during the interactive phases of the task was a primary predictor of infants' social bids in the still-face phase. When infants were divided into those who experienced higher maternal mirroring (maternal mirroring above the mean of the sample) and infants who experienced lower maternal mirroring (maternal mirroring at or below the mean), infants with higher maternal mirroring showed increases in nondistress vocalizations during the still-face phase, indicative of social bidding, whereas the infants with lower maternal mirroring showed little change in nondistress vocalizations across the phases. Maternal mirroring allows infants to readily notice the relation between their own behaviors and those of their mothers, which may enhance infants' early understanding that they can be active agents in instigating social interactions, as demonstrated by social bidding.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAY-JUN	2018	23	3					367	385		10.1111/infa.12221	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12221													WOS:000430107000004

Functional Parallelism of Detailed and Rough Speech Processing at the End of Infancy	INFANCY												Although realization of the same speech sound is far from being consistent across different contexts, speech recognition has to rely on phonetic detail in order to detect words. So far, it appeared that young infants cannot avoid noticing subtle speech sound variation whenever it occurs. Only later on, they are able to tolerate speech sound variation in some word recognition tasks. Here, we test whether this ability is associated with the time infants start storing their first word forms. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in a priming paradigm. German words (targets) followed syllables (primes) with a different amount of phoneme overlap. We tested infants at three, six, and ninemonths after birth. ERPs reflected sensitivity to prime-target variation in a single phoneme in three-month-olds, tolerance to this in six-month-olds, and both processing aspects in nine-month-olds. Our findings reveal individual developmental priorities for different aspects of speech processing, with very detailed speech processing dominating at around 3months, rough processing dominating at around half a year after birth, and an architecture of parallel rough and detailed processing at around 9months. Functional parallelism at the end of infancy might explain the heterogeneous pattern of results regarding the degree of acoustic detail that toddlers appear to consider at different ages and across different paradigms.

J	Smith, NA; McMurray, B				Smith, Nicholas A.; McMurray, Bob			Temporal Responsiveness in Mother-Child Dialogue: A Longitudinal Analysis of Children with Normal Hearing and Hearing Loss	INFANCY												Dialogue between conversational partners, including mothers and their children, is precisely timed. The predictability of this timing is important for establishing and maintaining interaction, communication, and learning. This longitudinal study examines changes in the response latency of utterances in dialogue between mothers and their normal hearing and hearing-impaired children between 4 and 60months of age. Mothers and their children showed parallel developmental trends, responding to each other more quickly at older ages. Beyond these age-related group effects, significant dyadic effects were found in which individual children's latencies were related to those of their mothers, and vice versa. Developmental patterns did not significantly differ across hearing status groups, which may reflect the role of early identification and intervention in promoting positive developmental outcomes.

Exploring Infant Gesture and Joint Attention as Related Constructs and as Predictors of Later Language	INFANCY												In infancy, use of gesture and the ability to engage in joint attention with others both predict later language development. Conceptually, gesture and joint attention abilities may reflect a similar underlying social-communicative skill. However, these abilities are often studied separately. Despite the fact that gesture is often used in episodes of joint attention, little is known about the degree to which measures of gesture use and joint attention ability are associated with one another or how they similarly, or differentially, predict children's language abilities. Participants in this study were 53 infants. At 12 months, multiple measures of infants' gesture use were gleaned from a free-play interaction with a parent. Infants' responding to and initiating joint attention were measured via the Early Social-Communicative Scales (Mundy et al., 2003). Infants' expressive and receptive language was measured at 24 months with the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (Mullen, 1995). A factor analysis including gesture and joint attention measures indicated that at 12 months, joint attention, particularly responding to joint attention, reflects a similar underlying construct with infant gesture use, yet they uniquely predict later language ability.

Infants Show Selectivity in Their Behaviors Toward an Unconventional Emoter	INFANCY												We examined whether 18-month-olds understand how the emotional valence of people's experiences predicts their subsequent emotional reactions, as well as how their behaviors are influenced by the reliability of the emoter. Infants watched a person express sadness after receiving an object that was either inappropriate (conventional emoter) or appropriate (unconventional emoter) to perform an action. Then, infants' imitation, social referencing, and prosocial behaviors (helping) were examined when interacting with the person. Results showed that during the exposure phase, the unconventional group showed visual search patterns suggesting hypothesis testing and expressed less concern toward the person than the conventional group. In the social referencing task, the conventional group preferred to search for the target of a positive expression as opposed to the disgust object. In contrast, the unconventional group was more likely to trust the person's negative expression. As expected, no differences were found between the groups on the instrumental helping tasks. However, during the empathic helping tasks, the conventional group needed fewer prompts to help than the unconventional group. These findings provide the first evidence that the congruence between a person's emotional responses and her experiences impacts 18-month-olds' subsequent behaviors toward that person.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAY-JUN	2018	23	3					453	470		10.1111/infa.12230	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12230													WOS:000430107000008

Negative (But Not Positive) Parenting Interacts with Infant Negative Affect to Predict Infant Approach: Evidence of Diathesis-Stress	INFANCY												Temperament by parenting interactions may reflect that individuals with greater risk are more likely to experience negative outcomes in adverse contexts (diathesis-stress) or that these individuals are more susceptible to contextual influences in a for better or for worse pattern (differential susceptibility). Although such interactions have been identified for a variety of child outcomes, prior research has not examined approach characteristicsexcitement and approach toward pleasurable activitiesin the first year of life. Therefore, this study investigated whether 6-month maternal reported infant negative affecta phenotypic marker of risk/susceptibilityinteracted with 8-month observed parenting behaviors (positive parenting, negative parenting) to predict 12-month infant behavioral approach. Based on a sample of mothers and their infants (N=150), results indicated that negative parenting was inversely associated with subsequent approach for infants with high, but not low, levels of negative affect. Similar results did not occur regarding positive parenting. These findings better fit a diathesis-stress model rather than a differential susceptibility model. Implications and limitations of these findings are discussed.					; Bridgett, David/B-1963-2014	Holzman, Jacob/0000-0002-0418-0948; Bridgett, David/0000-0002-3138-5199													1525-0008	1532-7078				MAY-JUN	2018	23	3					471	480		10.1111/infa.12223	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12223								29731696					WOS:000430107000009

However, little is known about the roles of key hypothalamic-pituitary axis regulatory genes in the placenta modulating this association. This study will examine whether placental gene expression levels of 11-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (HSD11B2), glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), and mineralocorticoid receptor (NR3C2) can help elucidate the underlying mechanisms linking prenatal depression to infant temperament, particularly in infants with high negativity and low emotion regulation. Stored placenta tissues (N=153) were used to quantify messenger ribonucleic acid levels of HSD11B2, NR3C1, and NR3C2. Assessments of prenatal depression and infant temperament at 6months of age were ascertained via maternal report. Results found that prenatal depression was associated with increased Negative Affectivity (p<.05) after controlling for postnatal depression and psychosocial characteristics. Furthermore, the association between prenatal depression and Negative Affectivity was moderated by gene expression levels of HSD11B2, NR3C1, and NR3C2 such that greater gene expression significantly lessened the association between prenatal depression and Negative Affectivity. Our findings suggest that individual differences in placental gene expression may be used as an early marker of susceptibility or resilience to prenatal adversity.

Early models of infant attention suggested that the degree to which different visual features were detectable determines their attentional priority. Here, we tested this by asking whether two targetsdefined by different features, but each equally salient when evaluated independentlywould drive attention equally when pitted head-to-head. In Experiment 1, we presented 6-month-old infants with an array of Gabor patches in which a target region varied either in color or spatial frequency from the background. Using a forced-choice preferential-looking method, we measured how readily infants fixated the target as its featural difference from the background was parametrically increased. Then, in Experiment 2, we used these psychometric preference functions to choose values for color and spatial frequency targets that were equally salient (preferred), and pitted them against each other within the same display. We reasoned that if salience is transitive, then the stimuli should be iso-salient and infants should therefore show no systematic preference for either stimulus. On the contrary, we found that infants consistently preferred the color-defined stimulus. This suggests that computing visual salience in more complex scenes needs to include factors above and beyond local salience values.

Integration of Thought and Action: Arm Weights Facilitate Search Accuracy in 24-Month-Old Children	INFANCY												Search errors are common in cognitive tasks with infants and toddlers, and these errors reveal important insights to the development of competence and performance. Riviere and Lecuyer (2008, Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 100, 1) demonstrated that 29-month-olds typically make an error during a search task involving invisible displacement. However, performance improves significantly when children wear weighted wrist bands while doing the task. To investigate this phenomenon further, we tested 24-month-old children in an identical search task (N=35). Half the children wore weighted wrist bands, and the rest were in a no-weight condition. To test how far this phenomenon generalizes, we also tested the same children in a second search task where they needed to find a ball that had rolled behind one of four doors. The results showed that children in the no-weight condition replicated previous findings of poor performance on both search tasks. Unlike 29-month-olds, the 24-month-olds in the weighted condition did not immediately show improvement on the search tasks. However, after an initial search attempt, children wearing weights performed significantly better than chance. The findings shed new light on the interplay between thought and action.

However, no studies exist on early life stress and infant executive functioning (EF). The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between maternal pre- and postnatal stress and infant EF, and whether these associations are moderated by infant sex. Maternal prenatal depressive, general anxiety, and pregnancy-specific anxiety symptoms were measured three times, and postnatal depressive and general anxiety symptoms were measured 6months postpartum. Infant EF was assessed with a modified A-not-B task 8months postpartum (N=214). Maternal postnatal general anxiety predicted poorer EF in girls in comparison with boys. Moreover, there was a trend toward an interaction between prenatal anxiety and infant sex such that prenatal anxiety predicted infant EF differently in girls and in boys. No association was found between depressive symptoms or pregnancy-specific anxiety symptoms and infant EF. These findings suggest that maternal anxiety may have sex-specific effects on early EF and that pre- and postnatal stress may differently affect infant EF/cognitive development. The implications of these findings and important future directions are discussed.

Mother-Toddler Cortisol Synchrony Moderates Risk of Early Internalizing Symptoms	INFANCY												Cortisol synchrony is the degree to which mother-toddler cortisol levels are mutually regulated within a dyad. Synchrony's impact on toddler development is not well understood, so this study investigated how synchronous cortisol levels (reactivity and total concentration) in mother-toddler dyads moderate the association between risk factors (i.e., maternal worry, toddler inhibition) and early internalizing symptoms. Seventy mothers and their 2-year-old toddlers provided interpretable saliva samples. Behavioral observations were made to assess the toddler's temperament at age 2, and mothers reported on their toddler's internalizing symptoms when toddlers were 2 and 3years old. Results suggest that mother-toddler synchrony in total cortisol concentration moderates the relation between risk factors and internalizing symptoms. Specifically, toddler inhibition and maternal worry were less associated with concurrent toddler internalizing symptoms when dyads demonstrated greater cortisol synchrony in total concentration. Further, synchrony in total cortisol levels marginally moderated the association between toddler inhibition and future internalizing symptoms, such that inhibited toddlers were less likely to demonstrate internalizing symptoms at age 3 when dyads demonstrated more cortisol synchrony. This suggests that cortisol synchrony may serve as an advantageous context that reduces the risk of developing of internalizing symptoms and augments the field's understanding of the implications of shared physiological responses within mother-toddler dyads.

Therefore, we could reasonably expect sensitivity to different trajectories already at birth, as a precursor of later communicative and defensive abilities. To investigate this possibility, we measured newborns' looking behavior to evaluate their ability to discriminate between visual stimuli depicting motion along different trajectories happening within the space surrounding their body. Differently from previous studies, we did not take into account defensive reactions, which may not be elicited by impending collision as newborns might not categorize approaching stimuli as possible dangers. In two experiments, we showed that newborns display a spontaneous visual preference for trajectories directed toward their body. We found this visual preference when visual stimuli depicted motion in opposite directions (approaching vs. receding) as well as when they both moved toward the peripersonal space and differed only in their specific target (i.e., the body vs. the space around it). These findings suggest that at birth human infants seem to be already equipped with visual mechanisms predisposing them to perceive their presence in the environment and to adaptively focus their attention on the peripersonal space and their bodily self.

Considering that the ability to segment words from fluent speech is crucial for lexical acquisition, Experiment 1 tested the ability of healthy extremely-to-late preterm infants to segment monosyllabic words at 6months of postnatal age. Results establish basic segmentation skills in these infants. While we failed to find an effect of the degree of prematurity, this issue will need further exploration. Future studies will also have to specify the scope of these early segmentation skills, both in terms of the types of words segmented, the cues used to do so, and in terms of possible differences in performance between subgroups of preterm infants (e.g., based on gestational age or medical risks). Lastly, given that the preterm infants tested had a mean maturational age of 4months, Experiment 2 explored monosyllabic segmentation in full-term 4-month olds. Infants succeeded at the task, providing the earliest developmental evidence of word segmentation in full-term infants. These findings better specify the early trajectory of segmentation abilities in both full-term and healthy, low-risk preterm infants and support the proposal that prematurity might have a differential effect on the early acquisition of various linguistic levels.

We know little about the relationship between maternal feeding behaviors and infant willingness to eat at the onset of complementary feeding (CF), and we know even less about how these patterns might vary across cultures. Thirty-seven dyads (15 from the UK and 22 from Italy) took part in a longitudinal study, during which mealtimes were video-recorded 1week after the onset of CF (Time 1) and at 7months of infant age (Time 2). The first five minutes of mealtimes were coded for maternal feeding behaviors, for infant willingness to eat, and for synchrony in feeding. Maternal vocal communications (MVCs) and attention-directing acts (ADAs) during the whole mealtime were also coded. Infant willingness to eat was significantly related to synchrony and co-eating, suggesting the importance of sensitivity and empathy during feeding as in other parent-infant interactions. The frequency of maternal ADAs varied between nationalities and, contrary to current advice, did not relate negatively to infant willingness to eat. These patterns and variations suggest the need to consider CF as a contextually variable and sensitive foundation for feeding relationships.

While there is an increasing body of evidence for the effect of labels heard in-task on infants' online processing, whether infants' learned linguistic representations shape learned nonlinguistic representations is unclear. In this study 10-month-old infants were trained over the course of a week with two 3D objects, one labeled, and one unlabeled. Infants then took part in a looking time task in which 2D images of the objects were presented individually in a silent familiarization phase, followed by a preferential looking trial. During the critical familiarization phase, infants looked for longer at the previously labeled stimulus than the unlabeled stimulus, suggesting that learning a label for an object had shaped infants' representations as indexed by looking times. We interpret these results in terms of label activation and novelty response accounts and discuss implications for our understanding of early representational development.

Maternal Cues and Infant Responses During Object Play	INFANCY												Attention sharing provides an important context for infant learning, but it is not fully understood how infants respond to parents' isolated or combined actions to shift from nonsharing to attention-sharing states. To investigate this, we recorded unscripted toy-play interactions of infants (3 to 11months old, N=35) and mothers at home, and coded attention-related behaviors. These included infants' and mothers' visual fixations, and mothers' attention-directing actions including gaze shifts, pointing gestures, object manipulations, verbalizations, and object sounds. In addition, dyadic attention was continuously classified into one of seven states of shared or nonshared attention. Results showed that mothers usually produced a combination of attention-directing cues within the 7sec. before infants shifted their attention to match the mother's focus. Mothers' cue combinations usually included object manipulation and either a gaze shift or a verbalization. Infants seldom looked at mothers' faces and followed a very small proportion of isolated gaze shifts or pointing gestures. However, infants frequently shifted attention to watch mothers manipulate objects. The results indicate that during toy play, combinations of maternal attention-specifying actions selectively elicit infants' attention following.

J	Libertus, ME; Feigenson, L; Halberda, J				Libertus, Melissa E.; Feigenson, Lisa; Halberda, Justin			Infants Extract Frequency Distributions from Variable Approximate Numerical Information	INFANCY												Previous research shows that infants represent approximate number: After habituation to a constant numerosity (e.g., eight dots), 6-month-old infants dishabituate to a novel numerosity (e.g., 16 dots). However, numerical information in the real world is far more variable and rarely offers repeated presentations of a single quantity. Instead, we often encounter quantities in the form of distributions around a central tendency. It remains unknown whether infants can represent frequency distributions from this type of distributed numerical input. Here, we asked whether 6-month-old infants can represent distributions of large approximate numerosities. In two experiments, we first familiarized infants to sequences of dot collections with varying numerosities. For half the infants, the sequence contained a unimodal frequency distribution, with numerosities centered around a single mean, and for the other half, it contained a bimodal frequency distribution of numerosities with two numerical peaks. We then tested infants with alternating or constant numerosities. Infants who had been familiarized to a unimodal distribution looked longer at alternating numerosities than constant numerosities (experiments 1 and 2), whereas infants who had been familiarized to a bimodal distribution looked longer at constant numerosities (Exp. 2). These findings suggest that infants can spontaneously extract frequency distributions from distributed numerical input.

More specifically we tested whether semi-rigid motion, conveyed by a change in facial expression, facilitates identity recognition. In Experiment 1, two-day-old newborns, habituated to a static happy or fearful face (static condition) have been tested using a pair of novel and familiar identity static faces with a neutral expression. Results indicated that newborns manifest a preference for the familiar stimulus, independently of the facial expression. In contrast, in Experiment 2 newborns habituated to a semi-rigid moving face (dynamic condition) manifest a preference for the novel face, independently of the facial expression. In Experiment 3, a multistatic image of a happy face with different degrees of intensity was utilized to test the role of different amount of static pictorial information in identity recognition (multistatic image condition). Results indicated that newborns were not able to recognize the face to which they have been familiarized. Overall, results clearly demonstrate that newborns' face recognition is strictly dependent on the learning conditions and that the semi-rigid motion conveyed by facial expressions facilitates identity recognition since birth.

Within these cohorts, the contribution of responsive and intrusive parenting to child language has been investigated; specific responsive and intrusive behaviors encapsulated within these parenting styles have yet to be fully examined. Additionally, the role of the mother-child dynamic in moderating mother-child associations has also not been explored. This study aimed to augment current research by identifying specific responsive and intrusive maternal behaviors associated with child language in a cohort experiencing adversity, as well as exploring the role of the fluency and connectedness of mother-child conversation in moderating associations (n=249). Specific behaviors and the fluency and connectedness of the mother-child interaction were coded from free-play videos at child age 12months. Child language measures were derived from transcripts of free play at 24months. Linear regression models were used to examine maternal-child associations. The moderating role of fluency and connectedness was then explored. Maternal imitations were positively associated with the child's total words; successful redirectives were negatively associated with the child's mean length of turn. Both associations were moderated by the fluency and connectedness of the interaction.

When Father Steps Forward and Mother Steps Back: The Moderating Role of Simultaneity inParents' Coparenting Behaviors in the Development of Anxiety in 4-to 30-Month-Olds	INFANCY												Infant negative affectivity predicts child anxiety. Coparenting might influence the development of anxiety by weakening this association in the case of supportive coparenting, or by strengthening this association in the case of undermining coparenting. Parents can display coparenting behaviors simultaneously (both parents being supportive or undermining), or divergently (only one parent being supportive or undermining). In our longitudinal study, we investigated whether coparenting moderated the relation between infant negative affectivity at 4months and child anxiety symptoms 2years later. Hundred-sixteen couples dressed up their firstborn infants in a clothes-changing task. We coded cooperative, mutual, neutral, and competitive coparenting behaviors. Both parents rated infant negative affectivity and child anxiety symptoms. Infant negative affectivity significantly predicted child anxiety. This association was moderated by parents' divergent cooperative coparenting: It was stronger when mothers were cooperative while fathers were neutral, and weaker when fathers were cooperative while mothers were neutral. When fathers step forward (i.e., being cooperative) and mothers step back (i.e., leaving space), they may protect their at-risk child from developing anxiety.

J	Castelain, T; Bernard, S; Mercier, H				Castelain, Thomas; Bernard, Stephane; Mercier, Hugo			Evidence that Two-Year-Old Children are Sensitive to Information Presented in Arguments	INFANCY												Preschoolers are more likely to endorse testimony supported by strong arguments than by weak, circular ones. Two-year-olds exchange arguments with others, but no experiment has demonstrated that they are sensitive to information presented as argument. In the first phase of this study, 2-year-olds were shown ambiguous picturesfor instance a bird-fish hybridand asked what they thought the picture represented. An informant then contradicted them, providing either a strong argument, a circular argument, or no argument, and the children were asked what they now thought the hybrid was. The second phase was identical to the first, with new hybrids, except that the informant never provided any argument for her position. Finally, in the third phase, the informant left the room and the children were asked again to tell what the hybrids from the first two phases were. On the whole, there was an effect of the amount of information provided in the argument so that children were more likely to endorse labels provided by the informant who had supported her answer with a strong argument in the first phase. Moreover, they generalized the trust granted to informants who provided strong arguments. These results constitute the first experimental demonstration that 2-year-olds possess some argument evaluation skills.

The categorization of speech representations into consonants and vowels is evidenced by the tendency of adult speakers, attested in many languages, to use consonants and vowels for different tasks. Consonants are favored in lexical tasks, while vowels are favored to learn structural regularities. Recent results suggest that this specialization is already observable at 12months of age in Italian participants. Here, we investigated the representations of younger infants. In a series of anticipatory looking experiments, we showed that Italian 6-month-olds rely more on vowels than on consonants when learning the predictions made by individual words (Experiment 1) and are better at generalizing a structure when it is implemented over vowels than when it is implemented over consonants (Experiments 2 and 3). Until 6months of age, infants thus show a general vocalic bias, which contrasts with the specialization previously observed at 12months. These results suggest the format of speech representations changes during the second semester of life.

Newborns' Cries are Unique to Individuals (But Not to Language Environment)	INFANCY												Human neonates exhibit individually distinctive patterns of variationsometimes called cry signaturesin the acoustics of their cries. For tests of group differences (e.g., age, health status, or ambient language differences), the uniqueness of cry sounds to individuals means that multiple cries from same infant cannot appropriately be treated as independent events for analysis. This approach violates the assumption of independence that underlies many statistical techniques and runs the risk of uncovering significant group effects that do not actually exist. Nonetheless, publications continue to appear in which multiple cries from the same infant have been treated as independent events for analysis. To demonstrate the perils, we have compared the cries of infants born into a Mandarin Chinese language environment with cries of infants born into an American English language environment. We show (1) that treating each cry sound as an independent event yields numerous significant group effects and (2) that these effects all but disappear when cries are treated appropriately, as nested within individual infants. The latter outcome is in keeping with prevailing models of neonatal cry production and casts doubt on the claim that neonates alter their cries to match features of the language spoken in their environment.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV-DEC	2017	22	6					736	747		10.1111/infa.12192	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12192													WOS:000412890800001

INFANCY												Infants are readily able to use their recent experience to shape their future behavior. Recent work has confirmed that infants generate neural predictions based on their recent experience (Emberson, Richards, & Aslin, 2015) and that neural predictions trigger visual system activity similar to that elicited by visual stimulation. This study uses behavioral methods to ask, how visual is visual prediction? In Experiment 1, we confirmed that when additional trials provide additional visual experience with the experimental shape, infants exhibit a robust novelty preference. In Experiment 2, we removed the visual stimulus from some trials and presented the predictive auditory cue alone, allowing the effects of neural prediction to be assessed. We found no evidence of looking preferences at test, suggesting that visual prediction does not contribute to the computation of visual familiarity. In Experiment 3, we provided infants with a degraded visual stimulus to test whether visual prediction could bias visual perception under ambiguous conditions. Again, we found no evidence of looking preferences at test, suggesting that visual prediction is not biasing perception of an uncertain stimulus. Overall, our results suggest that visual prediction is not visual, in the strictest sense, despite the presence of visual system activation.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV-DEC	2017	22	6					748	761		10.1111/infa.12188	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12188													WOS:000412890800002

Infants' Speed Discrimination: Effects of Different Ratios and Spatial Orientations	INFANCY												This study addressed the question whether 6-month-olds' speed discrimination is ratio dependent and whether an oblique effect (i.e., more accurate discrimination of cardinally as opposed to obliquely oriented objects) affects their speed discrimination skills. Infants were habituated to visual displays showing a ball moving with constant speed and tested with the familiar and a novel speed in the test phase. This ball moved either on a cardinally or obliquely oriented trajectory. Irrespective of orientation, infants looked longer at the novel speed when speeds differed by a ratio of 1:2, whereas they looked indiscriminable at the novel and familiar speeds when they differed by a ratio of 2:3. Our results show remarkable parallels to infants' ratio-dependent discrimination behavior in other domains (time, distance, and number), implying that different magnitudes may be processed by the same underlying mechanism. However, our findings also indicate that speed discrimination was not influenced by spatial orientation in a similar way as has been found for other visual perceptual processes.

J	Benders, T				Benders, Titia			Six-Month-Old Infants Prefer Speech with Raised Formant Frequencies	INFANCY												Voices can be characterized by their fundamental frequency as well as by speech timbre characteristics, such as formant frequencies. While infants' responses to fundamental frequency characteristics are well established, very little is known about how infants respond to changes in formant frequencies. This study tested whether 6-month-old infants prefer listening to speech with raised formant frequencies over speech with lowered formant frequencies. Naturally spoken utterances were acoustically manipulated to render raised-formant and lowered-formant stimuli that only differed in the formant frequencies, while keeping fundamental frequency and other acoustic characteristics constant. Infants in an infant-controlled listening procedure listened longer to the raised-formant than to the lowered-formant stimuli. These results provide the first evidence that infants distinguish and show preferences for variations in formant frequencies in adult speech.

We tested French-learning 4-, 8-, and 11-month-olds on Tone 2 (rising) versus Tone 3 (dipping), the most acoustically similar contrast in Mandarin, and on Tone 1 (high) versus Tone 4 (falling), acoustically more dissimilar contrast. We hypothesized that sensitivity should decline with age for the similar contrast, and the dissimilar contrast should remain more discriminable. Infants were habituated to one tone and tested with the same tone versus the contrastive tone. Results showed that the dissimilar T1-T4 contrast was consistently discriminated by all three ages, whereas the discrimination of the similar T2-T3 contrast revealed a tendency to decline over the ages. These results suggest that relative to consonants and vowels, perceptual sensitivity to lexical tones remains stronger in non-tone-learning infants. Discrimination of lexical tones is affected by both acoustic salience and perceptual attunement to the native-language phonology.					gao, jun/C-9582-2012														1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV-DEC	2017	22	6					790	800		10.1111/infa.12191	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12191													WOS:000412890800005

We were interested in the infants' behavior to attune prosody with pointing intentions. Twenty-five children were involved at 12, 15, and 18months of age in an experimental procedure devised to elicit imperative and declarative pointing. Pointing, vocality associated with pointing, and the prosody of that vocality were analyzed. A significant increase in the coupling of pointing and vocality was observed from 12 to 15months, and in the ability to differentiate prosody with respect to the intention of the gesture from 15 to 18months. Also, the infants who pointed declaratively at 12months were likely to couple declarative pointing with vocality at 15months, and the infants who coupled at 15months were likely to differentiate prosody by the pointing intention at 18months. Results suggest that the match between prosody and pointing intentions emerges gradually during the first half of the second year of life. They also show a relationship between earlier and later pointing-vocal coupling, and a role for declarative communication in promoting that progression. Overall, our study supports the view of intentional communication as a time-based and context-based developmental process.

Coregulation and the Quality of the Relationship in Full-Term and Very Low-Birthweight Preterm Infant-Mother Dyads During Face-To-Face Interactions	INFANCY												Interactions with parents build the foundation for infants' social-emotional development. This study investigated coregulation of the interaction and quality of relationship between mothers and their 6-month-old full-term (n=43) and very low-birthweight/preterm (VLBW/preterm; n=44; ages corrected for prematurity) infants. The objectives were to examine (1) how coregulation changed following a perturbed interaction, (2) how coregulation differed between full-term and VLBW/preterm infant-mother dyads, and (3) the association between coregulation and relationship quality. Coregulation was coded using the Revised Relational Coding System (Fogel etal., 2003). Quality of the relationship was measured using the Emotional Availability scales (Biringen etal., 2014; Carter etal., 1998). Dyads participated in the Still-Face (SF) procedure (Tronick etal., 1978) consisting of two natural and one SF period where mothers assumed a neutral expression, refraining from interacting with their infants. Following the SF period, dyads engaged in more symmetrical and more disruptive patterns of coregulation. While full-term dyads engaged in more sequential-symmetrical, VLBW/preterm dyads engaged in more resonant-symmetrical coregulation. These results suggest that VLBW/preterm dyads may show more emotional reactivity in their interactions than full-term dyads; however, in both groups infant responsiveness and parenting stress influenced the types of coregulation exhibited.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV-DEC	2017	22	6					819	842		10.1111/infa.12187	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12187													WOS:000412890800007

When the agent consistently chose one object over another, three or four times consecutively, infants acted as if they had interpreted her actions as evidence for her preference. In contrast, when the agent inconsistently chose between the two objects, at the ratio of 1:3, infants did not seem to interpret her actions as suggesting her preference. Converging evidence was obtained from infants' responses across a looking-time task and an action task. The results are discussed in terms of how infants might use frequencies of agents' actions directed toward different objects to understand agents' preferences.

Fifty-five 7- to 8-month-old infants were tested. A visual object prediction paradigm was developed during which a three-dimensional object was presented in a live eye-tracking setting. During familiarization, the object rotated back and forth along the vertical axis. While the object was moving, two target parts of it were briefly occluded from view and uncovered again as the object changed its direction of motion. In the test phase, the entire object was rotated around 90 degrees and now rotated along the horizontal axis. We recorded infants' eye movements directed at the target locations and analyzed the prediction rates. All of the infants also participated in a manual object exploration task, in which they freely explored five toy blocks. Infants with a higher level of object exploration skill had higher prediction rates during test trials as compared to infants with less proficient object exploratory actions. The results support the interpretation that advanced manual object exploration experience is associated with infants' advanced visual prediction ability of the appearance of objects moving in space.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV-DEC	2017	22	6					857	873		10.1111/infa.12195	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12195													WOS:000412890800009

Thirty-six 12-month-old infants viewed three distinct interpersonal events (give a toy, break a toy, fight over a toy) followed by an emotional expression (happiness, sadness, anger) that was either congruent or incongruent with the preceding event outcome.

Infants demonstrated sensitivity to incongruent emotional reactions for the give and fight events, representing the earliest evidence to date of emotional sensitivity to negative events.

Moreover, becoming a mother of a VPT infant is a traumatic event, which might affect the establishment of a bonding relationship toward the infant during the postnatal period. The main aim of the present study was to assess the association between maternal postnatal bonding and socio-emotional stress response in 3-month-old VPT infants, compared to full-term (FT) controls. Thirty-three VPT and 28 FT infant-mother dyads underwent the maternal Face-to-Face Still-Face (FFSF) procedure to assess socio-emotional stress regulation. Maternal postnatal bonding was measured through the Maternal Post-Natal Attachment Scale (MPAS), which includes three scales: Quality of attachment, Absence of hostility, and Pleasure in interaction. The VPT infants exhibited less self-directed and other-directed regulatory behaviors during the Still-Face episode. Mothers of VPT infants reported lower Quality of attachment compared to FT counterparts. Importantly, higher levels of Quality of attachment were associated with more other-directed behaviors during the Still-Face episode in FT dyads, whereas this was not observed in VPT dyads. In conclusion, VPT infants might be exposed to a double-risk condition for socio-emotional development, encompassing both difficulties in stress response and the exposure to a less-than-optimal maternal bonding.

Building on previous work using the simultaneous streams change detection task, we confirmed that 8- and 10-month-old infants are sensitive to changes in binding between identity and location in VSTM. Further, we demonstrated that infants recognize specifically what changed in these events. Thus, infants' VSTM for binding is robust and can be observed in different procedures and with different stimuli.

Integrated Emotion Processing in Infancy: Matching of Faces and Bodies	INFANCY												Accurate assessment of emotion requires the coordination of information from different sources such as faces, bodies, and voices. Adults readily integrate facial and bodily emotions. However, not much is known about the developmental origin of this capacity. Using a familiarization paired-comparison procedure, 6.5-month-olds in the current experiments were familiarized to happy, angry, or sad emotions in faces or bodies and tested with the opposite image type portraying the familiar emotion paired with a novel emotion. Infants looked longer at the familiar emotion across faces and bodies (except when familiarized to angry images and tested on the happy/angry contrast). This matching occurred not only for emotions from different affective categories (happy, angry) but also within the negative affective category (angry, sad). Thus, 6.5-month-olds, like adults, integrate emotions from bodies and faces in a fairly sophisticated manner, suggesting rapid development of emotion processing early in life.

Follow My Gaze: Face Race and Sex Influence Gaze-Cued Attention in Infancy	INFANCY												Using the eye gaze of others to direct one's own attention develops during the first year of life and is thought to be an important skill for learning and social communication. However, it is currently unclear whether infants differentially attend to and encode objects cued by the eye gaze of individuals within familiar groups (e.g., own race, more familiar sex) relative to unfamiliar groups (e.g., other race, less familiar sex). During gaze cueing, but prior to the presentation of objects, 10-month-olds looked longer to the eyes of own-race faces relative to 5-month-olds and relative to the eyes of other-race faces. After gaze cueing, two objects were presented alongside the face and at both ages, infants looked longer to the uncued objects for faces from the more familiar-sex and longer to cued objects for the less familiar-sex faces. Finally, during the test phase, both 5- and 10-month-old infants looked longer to uncued objects relative to cued objects but only when the objects were cued by an own-race and familiar-sex individual. Results demonstrate that infants use face eye gaze differently when the cue comes from someone within a highly experienced group.						Scott, Lisa/0000-0002-8136-891X; , Charisse B.

In particular, we explored whether toddlers would request their caregiver to help a needy other when they are not able to help themselves. Children observed another person who needed help to accomplish a task, but were either not able to provide help as the object was out of reach (Experiment 1) or because an obstacle prevented children from interacting with the other person (Experiments 2, 2b). The experiments revealed the same developmental trend with 2.5-year-olds selectively involving their caregiver to help the needy other. The results are interpreted in terms of toddlers' motivation to see others helped and with respect to their developing ability to actively involve others to regulate their emotions.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				SEP-OCT	2017	22	5					645	664		10.1111/infa.12173	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12173								33158333					WOS:000407506700004
J	Waugh, WE; Brownell, CA				Waugh, Whitney E.; Brownell, Celia A.			"Help Yourself!" What Can Toddlers' Helping Failures Tell Us About the Development of Prosocial Behavior?	INFANCY												Prosocial behavior emerges in the second year of life, yet it is typical for children in this period not to share, comfort, or help. We compared toddlers (18, 30months) who helped with those who did not help on two tasks (instrumental helping; empathic helping). More than half of children failed to help on one or both tasks. Nonhelpers engaged in more hypothesis testing on the instrumental helping task, but more security-seeking, wariness, and playing on the empathic helping task. Across tasks, children who tended to engage in nonhelping behaviors associated with negative emotional arousal also tended to seek comfort from a parent. In contrast, children who tended to play instead of helping were less likely to exhibit negative emotional arousal or hypothesis testing, suggesting a focus on their own interests. Parents of 18-month-old nonhelpers on the instrumental task were less engaged in socializing prosocial behavior in their toddlers than were the parents of helpers. On the empathic helping task, 18-month-old nonhelpers had less mature self-other understanding than did helpers. By examining how the predominant reasons for failing to help vary with age and task, we gain a fuller perspective on the factors involved in the early development of prosocial behavior.

The Trajectory of Concurrent Motor and Vocal Behaviors Over the Transition to Crawling in Infancy	INFANCY												To document the trajectory of motor and vocal behaviors in real and developmental time, we observed infants at each of four biweekly naturalistic play sessions over the transition to crawling. An exhaustive and mutually exclusive coding scheme documented all vocalizations and postures. Odds ratios of the likelihood of a given posture-vocalization dyad revealed that vocalization and crawling were significantly unlikely to co-occur at the session marking the onset of crawling. We speculate that infants' allocation of attention over the transition to crawling prompted behavioral trade-offs. During mastery of a novel skill, infants may have had difficulty allocating attention to multiple tasks, but with experience, a decrease in attentional load for the new skill allowed performance of simultaneous behaviors in other domains to occur.

To Cue or Not to Cue: Toddlers' Use of Beacons and Associative Cues in Object-displacement Tasks	INFANCY												Two experiments examined 24- and 30-month-olds' use of different forms of landmark information in an object-displacement task involving a car rolling down a ramp whose trajectory was occluded by a screen containing doors. A pompom attached to the car, visible through a transparent window running across the screen, served as a cue for the car's location and functioned either as a beacon cue, directly guiding search to a given location, or an associative cue, indirectly marking target location. Interestingly, one way in which the cue information was modified from a beacon to an associative cue was in terms of the structure of the search apparatus, and not necessarily the cue information itself. Consistent with previous literature, 24-month-olds' search was significantly influenced by the shift from beacon to associative cue information, whereas 30-month-olds, although affected by the shift from one to the other, were less affected by this variation. These findings suggest that the cue drives attention to specific locations in space, with search behavior being more accurate when the cue directly marks the hiding location (i.e., beacon) than when the cue indirectly marks it (i.e., associative cue).

The gap-overlap task can be administered at all ages and is widely used to study the development of overt visual attention. However, studies using the gap-overlap task report different measures and little is known about the tasks' psychometric properties, especially in infants. We tested the 1-week test-retest reliability of two frequently used gap-overlap measures of attentional disengagement in 10-month-old infants; the gap effect as measured by the difference between the gap and overlap condition and the gap effect as measured by the difference between the gap and baseline condition. Sixty-seven infants performed the gap-overlap task twice, of which 45 infants had sufficient data quality for further analyses. Test-retest reliability of the overlap-gap gap effect was higher (r=.50) than the baseline-gap gap effect (r=.29). Moreover, the shared variance between overlap and baseline saccadic reaction times was moderate to high across sessions. In light of these results and the methodological challenges and limitations of infant research, we consider the overlap-gap gap effect to be a good measure to study the development of attentional disengagement in infants and suggest the exclusion of the baseline condition in future studies.						van der Stigchel, Stefan/0000-0002-5918-3521; Cousijn, Janna/0000-0002-7699-2582													1525-0008	1532-7078				JUL-AUG	2017	22	4					571	579		10.1111/infa.12185	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12185													WOS:000403931500009

Developmental research-especially with infant participants-also has discipline-specific replicability challenges, including small samples and limited measurement methods. Inspired by collaborative replication efforts in cognitive and social psychology, we describe a proposal for assessing and promoting replicability in infancy research: large-scale, multi-laboratory replication efforts aiming for a more precise understanding of key developmental phenomena. The ManyBabies project, our instantiation of this proposal, will not only help us estimate how robust and replicable these phenomena are, but also gain new theoretical insights into how they vary across ages, linguistic communities, and measurement methods. This project has the potential for a variety of positive outcomes, including less-biased estimates of theoretically important effects, estimates of variability that can be used for later study planning, and a series of best-practices blueprints for future infancy research.

Sample Size, Statistical Power, and False Conclusions in Infant Looking-Time Research	INFANCY					ICIS Meeting on Best Practices in Infancy Research	2016	New Orleans, LA					Infant research is hard. It is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming to identify, recruit, and test infants. As a result, ours is a field of small sample sizes. Many studies using infant looking time as a measure have samples of 8-12 infants per cell, and studies with more than 24 infants per cell are uncommon. This paper examines the effect of such sample sizes on statistical power and the conclusions drawn from infant looking-time research. An examination of the state of the current literature suggests that most published looking-time studies have low power, which leads in the long run to an increase in both false positive and false negative results. Three data sets with relatively large samples (>30 infants) were used to simulate experiments with smaller sample sizes; 1,000 random subsamples of 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 infants from the overall samples were selected, making it possible to examine the systematic effect of sample size on the results. This approach revealed that despite clear results with the original large samples, the results with smaller subsamples were highly variable, yielding both false positive and false negative outcomes. Finally, a number of emerging possible solutions are discussed.

A Survey of Common Practices in Infancy Research: Description of Policies, Consistency Across and Within Labs, and Suggestions for Improvements	INFANCY					ICIS Meeting on Best Practices in Infancy Research	2016	New Orleans, LA					Psychology is currently in a period of unprecedented self-reflection, with particular attention being paid to research practices and policies. Although infancy researchers have a history of attending to research practice in the form of papers outlining how to best implement various methods and paradigms, less is known about the particular practices currently being used by researchers in the field, making it difficult to identify areas for improvement. To address this issue, we developed an online survey for measuring methodological practices in infancy laboratories around the world. Our results suggest that infancy researchers adopt a range of a priori research practices. Individuals earlier in their training (particularly within the first year) were more likely to report not knowing their lab's policies, especially regarding issues that arise late in the research process. Members of the same lab agreed on lab policies at above-chance levels; however, improvements could be made. The use of clearly problematic research practices was relatively rare; however, several "risk-permeable" practices were identified that may, under select circumstances, threaten data integrity. We discuss how our results could be used to improve practice in infant research.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				JUL-AUG	2017	22	4					470	491		10.1111/infa.12183	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12183													WOS:000403931500004

Maternal Lifetime Trauma Exposure, Prenatal Cortisol, and Infant Negative Affectivity	INFANCY												Little research has examined the impact of maternal lifetime trauma exposure on infant temperament. We examined associations between maternal trauma history and infant negative affectivity and modification by prenatal cortisol exposure in a sociodemographically diverse sample of mother-infant dyads. During pregnancy, mothers completed measures of lifetime trauma exposure and current stressors. Third-trimester cortisol output was assessed from maternal hair. When infants were 6 months old, mothers completed the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised. In analyses that controlled for infant sex and maternal age, education, race/ethnicity, and stress during pregnancy, greater maternal trauma exposure was associated with increased infant distress to limitations and sadness. Higher and lower prenatal cortisol exposure modified the magnitude and direction of association between maternal trauma history and infant rate of recovery from arousal. The association between maternal trauma history and infant distress to limitations was somewhat stronger among infants exposed to higher levels of prenatal cortisol. The analyses suggested that maternal lifetime trauma exposure is associated with several domains of infant negative affectivity independently of maternal stress exposures during pregnancy and that some of these associations may be modified by prenatal cortisol exposure. The findings have implications for understanding the intergenerational impact of trauma exposure on child developmental outcomes.

Multiple Coordination Patterns in Infant and Adult Vocalizations	INFANCY												The study of vocal coordination between infants and adults has led to important insights into the development of social, cognitive, emotional, and linguistic abilities. We used an automatic system to identify vocalizations produced by infants and adults over the course of the day for fifteen infants studied longitudinally during the first 2 years of life. We measured three different types of vocal coordination: coincidence-based, rate-based, and cluster-based. Coincidence-based coordination and rate-based coordination are established measures in the developmental literature. Cluster-based coordination is new and measures the strength of matching in the degree to which vocalization events occur in hierarchically nested clusters. We investigated whether various coordination patterns differ as a function of vocalization type, whether different coordination patterns provide unique information about the dynamics of vocal interaction, and how the various coordination patterns each relate to infant age. All vocal coordination patterns displayed greater coordination for infant speech-related vocalizations, adults adapted the hierarchical clustering of their vocalizations to match that of infants, and each of the three coordination patterns had unique associations with infant age. Altogether, our results indicate that vocal coordination between infants and adults is multifaceted, suggesting a complex relationship between vocal coordination and the development of vocal communication.

We present a new social bell-ringing task designed to facilitate synchronous movement to music in infants. Ten-month-olds, 18-month-olds, and adults were played musical tracks of various tempos and given handheld bells to ring, in the presence of either a live experimenter or an animated nonsocial stimulus. Surface electromyography (EMG) was used to measure the timing of arm movements during periods of bell ringing. Infants showed no evidence of synchronous bell ringing at any tempo. However, while the 10-month-olds did not modulate their ringing to the music tempo, the 18-month-olds showed tempo-flexibility. Moreover, 18-month-olds displayed more associated behaviors such as bouncing and rocking in the absence (rather than presence) of a social partner, whereas the behavior of the 10-month-olds was not modulated by the presence or absence of a social partner. The results suggest a distinction between "moving together" and "moving to the beat," which may have separate underlying mechanisms and developmental trajectories.

Two hundred and fifty-eight firstborn infants in a representative British community sample were observed at a mean age of 12.8 months in the presence of their parents and other participating families, in a laboratory sitting room decorated with balloons and banners. The picnic scenario was followed by free play with the other participating infants. At a mean of 36 months of age, mothers, fathers, and another informant who knew the child well completed the Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL). The majority of infants showed no vocal distress during the picnic scenario. A minority of infants expressed strong distress, which was correlated with elevated heart rate and production of cortisol. Infants who were not distressed were more likely to direct social behavior to their peers and especially likely to use physical force against peers. In comparison with strongly distressed and nondistressed infants, those who had shown mild distress during the picnic scenario were least likely to manifest later emotional problems. This pattern was particularly marked for boys. Taken together, the findings indicate that infants' strong distress during naturalistic encounters that are meant to be entertaining can suppress sociability and might indicate risk for subsequent emotional problems.

This study examined the effects of flood-related stress in pregnancy on 6-month-olds' neurodevelopment and examined the moderating effects of timing of the stressor in gestation and infant sex on these outcomes. Women exposed to the 2011 Queensland (Australia) floods in pregnancy completed surveys on their flood-related objective and subjective experiences at recruitment and reported on their infants' neurodevelopment on the problem solving, communication, and personal-social scales of the Ages and Stages-III at 6 months postpartum (N = 115). Interaction results showed that subjective flood stress in pregnancy had significantly different effects in boys and girls, and that at high levels of stress girls had significantly lower problem solving scores than boys. Timing of the flood later in pregnancy predicted lower personal-social scores in the sample, and there was a trend (p < .10) for greater objective flood exposure to predict lower scores. PNMS had no effect on infants' communication skills. In conclusion, differential aspects of maternal flood-related stress in pregnancy influenced aspects of 6-month-olds' neurodevelopment.

Limits of Object Persistence: Young Infants Perceive Continuity of Vertical and Horizontal Trajectories, But Not 45-Degree Oblique Trajectories	INFANCY												Previous research indicated that 4-month-old infants perceive continuity of objects moving on horizontal trajectories but appear to have difficulty processing occlusion events involving oblique trajectories. However, because perception of continuity of vertical trajectories has not been tested, it is uncertain whether this indicates a specific deficit for oblique trajectories or a specific advantage for horizontal trajectories. We evaluated the contribution of trajectory orientation and the form of occlusion in three experiments with one hundred and forty-four 4-month-olds. Infants perceived continuity of horizontal and vertical trajectories under all conditions presented. However, they did not perceive continuity of an oblique (45 degrees) trajectory under any condition. Thus, 4-month-olds appear unable to process continuity of a 45 degrees trajectory. In a fourth experiment with forty-eight 6- and 8-month-old infants, we demonstrated that by 6 months, infants' difficulty with oblique trajectories is overcome. We suggest that young infants' difficulty with markedly oblique trajectories likely relates to immature eye movement control.

J	Lakusta, L; DiFabrizio, S				Lakusta, Laura; DiFabrizio, Stephanie			And, the Winner Is ... A Visual Preference for Endpoints over Starting Points in Infants' Motion Event Representations	INFANCY												Infants represent objects that are endpoints in motion events and show a preference for encoding the endpoint (the duck waddles into a bowl) over the starting point (the duck waddles out of a box). This asymmetry continues to appear in nonlinguistic cognition and language throughout development. This study tests whether this asymmetry also shows up in 16-month-old infants' visual preferences for motion events, and if so, for which types of events. Infants looked longer at events depicting an "agentive" figure (e.g., duck) moving into an object (endpoint) than out of an object (starting point), and this asymmetry persisted even when the starting point object was larger and more colorful than the endpoint object and when it caused the motion of the figure. However, an asymmetry was not found when motion into/out of the endpoint/starting point involved was performed by a "nonagentive" (e.g., leaf) figure. These findings suggest that an endpoint/starting point asymmetry in infant cognition (1) extends to infants' visual preferences of motion events, (2) shows up most strongly for events that involve an "agentive" figure, and (3) is largely unaffected by the physical saliency of the starting point object. How a visual endpoint preference may support the acquisition of spatial language is considered.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAY-JUN	2017	22	3					323	343		10.1111/infa.12153	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12153								33158354					WOS:000402984100003

This study aimed to explore whether 9- and 12-month-old infants have knowledge of a hand-grasping movement (i.e., pincer grip), being able to recognize violations of the hand's anatomical constraints during the observation of that movement. Using a preferential looking paradigm, we showed that 12-month-olds discriminate between biomechanically possible and impossible pincer grips, preferring the former over the latter (Experiment 1). This capacity begins to emerge by 9 months of age, modulated by infants' own sensorimotor experience with pincer grip (Experiment 2). Our findings indicate that the ability to visually discriminate between pincer grasps differing in their biomechanical properties develops between 9 and 12 months of age, and that experience with self-produced hand movements might help infants in building a representation of the hand that encompasses knowledge of the physical constraints of this body part.

Although the literature presumes that biases for threat should be normative, present early in development, evident across multiple forms of threat, and stable across individuals, developmental work in this area is limited. Here, we examine the developmental differences in infants' (4- to 24-month-olds) attention to social (angry faces) and nonsocial (snakes) threats using a new age-appropriate dot-probe task. In Experiment 1, infants' first fixations were more often to snakes than to frogs, and they were faster to fixate probes that appeared in place of snakes vs. frogs. There were no significant age differences, suggesting that a perceptual bias for snakes is present early in life and stable across infancy. In Experiment 2, infants fixated probes more quickly after viewing any trials that contained an angry face compared to trials that contained a happy face. Further, there were age-related changes in infants' responses to face stimuli, with a general increase in looking time to faces before the probe and an increase in latency to fixate the probe after seeing angry faces. Together, this work suggests that different developmental mechanisms may be responsible for attentional biases for social vs. nonsocial threats.

J	Miller, JL; Gros-Louis, J				Miller, Jennifer L.; Gros-Louis, Julie			The Effect of Social Responsiveness on Infants' Object-Directed Imitation	INFANCY												Previous research has demonstrated that social interactions underlie the development of object-directed imitation. For example, infants differentially learn object action sequences from a live social partner compared to a social partner over a video monitor; however, what is not well understood is what aspects of social interactions influence social learning. Previous studies have found variable influences of different types of caregiver responsiveness on attention, language, and cognitive development. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine how the responsive style of a social partner influenced the learning of object-directed action sequences. Infants interacted with either a sensitive or redirective experimenter before the learning trial. Results revealed infants changed their patterns of engagement; infants interacting with a sensitive experimenter had longer periods of attentional engagement than infants interacting with a redirective experimenter. Furthermore, during the learning trial, the amount of sensitivity during interaction with the social partner predicted learning scores. These findings suggest that infants' attention is influenced by social partners' interactive style during ongoing interaction, which subsequently affects how infants learn from these social partners.

Bouchon et al. (2015) showed that French-learning 5-month-olds could detect a vowel change in their own name and not a consonant change, but also that infants reacted to the acoustic distance between vowels. Here, we tested British English-learning 5-month-olds in a similar study to examine whether the acoustic/phonological characteristics of the native language shape the nature of the acoustic/phonetic cues that infants pay attention to. In the first experiment, British English-learning infants failed to recognize their own name compared to a mispronunciation of initial consonant (e.g., Molly versus Nolly) or vowel (e.g., April versus Ipril). Yet in the second experiment, they did so when the contrasted name was phonetically dissimilar (e.g., Sophie versus Amber). Differences in phoneme category (stops versus continuants) between the correct consonant versus the incorrect one significantly predicted infants' own name recognition in the first experiment. Altogether, these data suggest that infants might enter into a phonetic mode of processing through different paths depending on the acoustic characteristics of their native language.

The Interaction Between Child Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia and Early Sensitive Parenting in the Prediction of Children's Executive Functions	INFANCY												This study investigated the interaction between children's parasympathetic functioning and maternal sensitive parenting behaviors during infancy and toddlerhood in the prediction of children's executive functions (EF) at the age of 5 years. Participants included 137 children and their mothers who were followed from the age of 3 months to 5 years. Children's cardiac activity was recorded at rest at multiple times from ages 3 to 36 months, and estimates of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA; a measure of parasympathetic functioning) were calculated. Sensitive parenting was assessed during a mother-child play task at ages 6, 12, 24, and 36 months, and 5 years. Children completed age appropriate EF tasks at the age of 5 years. The link between sensitive parenting during toddlerhood (ages 24 and 36 months) and children's later EF was moderated by children's RSA such that this positive link was evident only among children who had low levels of baseline RSA, and not among those who had high levels of baseline RSA. These findings were obtained while controlling for concurrent sensitive parenting and maternal and child verbal abilities. Results from this study provide evidence for the significant role of biopsychosocial processes in early childhood in the development of EF.

Infants between the ages of 15 and 26 weeks were tested in three studies with familiar stimuli displayed adjacent to novel stimuli on each trial. Differences in look duration, look number, and gaze shifts directed at novel versus familiar stimuli were assessed to measure their contributions to group and individual novelty preferences. Infants produced longer looks for novel stimuli in all three studies, and stimulus differences in look duration accounted for more than 50% of the variability in individual novelty preferences. Infants that produced more looks to novel rather than familiar stimuli did not produce overall novelty preferences unless they also looked longer at novel stimuli. Gaze shift patterns did not predict individual novelty preferences, and novel stimuli did not determine where infants looked. The infants' visual exploration was constrained by memories for the direction of the previous look as well as by the attention-holding features of novel stimuli.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAR-APR	2017	22	2					190	222		10.1111/infa.12154	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12154								33158341					WOS:000394782000003

Attention to Threat as a Predictor of Shyness in the Context of Internalizing and Externalizing Behavior	INFANCY												The duration of children's attention to putative threat has been documented as a consistent predictor of later anxiety in inhibited children across childhood (Fox, New Directions for Child and Adolescent Development, 127, 2010, 33; Perez-Edgar & Fox, Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Clinics of North America, 14, 2005, 681). However, attention to threat has not been broadly examined within existing behavioral contexts and has seldom been studied in very early childhood. Whereas toddlers with high levels of internalizing behavior may view fear-inducing stimuli as a threat, toddlers with high levels of externalizing behavior may demonstrate attention out of interest or sensation seeking. Thus, attention to threat was expected to predict increased toddler shyness in the context of either high internalizing problems or low externalizing behavior. We examined 117 twenty-four-month-old toddlers to determine whether attention to threat interacted with internalizing and externalizing behavior at 24 months of age to predict toddler shyness one year later. Results indicated that attention to threat predicted toddlers' lower shyness at 36 months when toddlers' externalizing behavior at age 24 months were high, but there was no significant interaction between toddlers' internalizing behavior and their attention to threat in predicting later shyness. These results expand our understanding of the contexts in which attention to threat in early childhood is a viable predictor of later shyness.

Young Infants' Understanding of Containment Events	INFANCY												The present research examined how certain features of a box affected 4.5-month-old infants' interpretation of containment events the box was involved in. If the box was a regular container, infants did not respond with increased attention when a tall cylinder became fully hidden after being lowered inside the box, consistent with previous research. In contrast, if a three-sided object (the box without its back) replaced the box, or if shown that the box had a removable back, infants were able to detect the height violations, 3 months earlier than they normally would. These results demonstrate how infants' perception or representation of objects interplays with their interpretation of physical events these objects involve in.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAR-APR	2017	22	2					256	270		10.1111/infa.12148	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12148								33158340					WOS:000394782000006

Parents reported the number of minutes that children spent the previous day doing nine media-related activities (e.g., watching television, playing handheld videogames). The object-retrieval task required children to watch a hiding event on video and then search for the object on another screen or a real felt board. Results indicated that toddlers' naturalistic experience with interactive (but not noninteractive) media predicted their screen-based learning in the laboratory. This was true regardless of whether children were tested using interactive or noninteractive video, suggesting that using interactive media (but not watching noninteractive video) is associated with children's learning from screen media generally.

In particular, SB rate is believed to reflect some dimensions of dopamine function; therefore, we hypothesized that SB rate would relate to working memory performance and to frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) asymmetry. Forty, 10-month-old infants completed an A-not-B task while SB and EEG were measured throughout. We found that SB rate varied across phases of the task, variability in SB rate was positively related to working memory performance, and frontal EEG asymmetry was related to individual differences in the rate of SB. Results provide indirect, but convergent support for the hypothesis that SB rate reflects dopamine function early in human development. As such, these results have implications for understanding the tonic and phasic effects of dopamine on cognitive activity early in human development.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAR-APR	2017	22	2					150	170		10.1111/infa.12164	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12164								28286427					WOS:000394782000001

Although previous studies have suggested that preference for social stimuli in infancy is a possible indicator of later social communication development, little is known about this relation in preterm infants. We examined the gaze behavior of low-risk preterm and full-term infants at 6 and 12 months' corrected ages using two types of eye-tracking tasks, which measured 1) preference for social stimuli by biological motion and human geometric preference and 2) ability to follow another's gaze direction. We found that preterm (compared with full-term) infants at both 6 and 12 months of age spent less time looking toward dynamic human images, followed another's gaze less frequently, and looked for a shorter time at an object cued by another. Moreover, we found a positive correlation between looking time toward dynamic human images and frequency of gaze following at 12 months of age in full-term, but not preterm, infants. We discuss the relation between the atypical patterns of gaze behavior in preterm infants and their higher risk of later social communication problems.

In two studies, we found that 18-month-old toddlers provided help equally in situations where an adult recipient was present and in situations where an adult recipient was not present. We included several control conditions to rule out that toddlers were simply unaware of their anonymity or were merely motivated to restore the physical order of things. Together, these findings suggest that early in ontogeny children are motivated to help others in need regardless of whether they can immediately be recognized for their prosocial intentions.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				JAN-FEB	2017	22	1					130	145		10.1111/infa.12143	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12143													WOS:000394782100008

In this study, 40 19-month-old toddlers recognized when a puppet chose the same toys as them. Toddlers preferred to affiliate with a puppet who chose the same toys as themselves relative to a puppet who chose other toys and they modified their subsequent behavior by choosing the same toys as that puppet when presented with novel toys. Toddlers' actions were not based on perceivable features of the puppet (e.g., similar accent or language as oneself) or an association between the puppet and the preferred toys (as assessed in a control condition). Results indicate that toddlers identified and recognized the similarity in action choices between themselves and the puppet via comparison between their own and the puppets' actions. Identifying this similarity is critical for children's developing understanding of and engagement in interactions with others.

It is thus important to know how infants' communicative behavior changes in relation to different caregiver responses; furthermore, how infants' modification of communicative behavior relates to language outcomes. We investigated 39 10-month-old infants' communication as a function of mothers' attention and responses and the relationship to language outcomes at 15 months. We elicited infants' communicative behavior in three conditions: (1) joint attention: Mothers were visually attending and responding to infants' attention and interest; (2) available: Mothers were visually attending to infants, but not responding contingently to infants' attention and interest; (3) unavailable: Mothers were not attending to infants nor responding to them. Infants vocalized more when mothers attended and responded to them (conditions 1 and 2) than when mothers did not (condition 3), but infants' gesture and gesture-vocal production did not differ across conditions. Furthermore, infants' production of a higher proportion of vocalizations in the unavailable condition relative to the joint attention condition correlated with, and predicted, infants' language scores at 15 months. Thus, infants who appear to be aware of the social effects of vocalizations may learn words better.

Home Environment, But Not Socioeconomic Status, is Linked to Differences in Early Phonetic Perception Ability	INFANCY												Infants perceptually tune to the phonemes of their native languages in the first year of life, thereby losing the ability to discriminate non-native phonemes. Infants who perceptually tune earlier have been shown to develop stronger language skills later in childhood. We hypothesized that socioeconomic disparities, which have been associated with differences in the quality and quantity of language in the home, would contribute to individual differences in phonetic discrimination. Seventy-five infants were assessed on measures of phonetic discrimination at 9 months, on the quality of the home environment at 15 months, and on language abilities at both ages. Phonetic discrimination did not vary according to socioeconomic status (SES), but was significantly associated with the quality of the home environment. This association persisted when controlling for 9-month expressive language abilities, rendering it less likely that infants with better expressive language skills were simply engendering higher quality home interactions. This suggests that infants from linguistically richer home environments may be more tuned to their native language and therefore less able to discriminate non-native contrasts at 9 months relative to infants whose home environments are less responsive. These findings indicate that home language environments may be more critical than SES in contributing to early language perception, with possible implications for language development more broadly.

However, we wonder whether, like language, the sensitivity of adult-child interactions is also important for encouraging child gesturing, rather than simply quantity of adult gestural input. Furthermore, children's use of gestures influences qualities of adult-child interaction, eliciting greater responsiveness and richer communication. Thus, we investigated the moderating role of nonparental caregiver sensitivity on the relationship between caregivers' and infants' use of pointing and symbolic gestures. We observed 10 infants (ages 6-19 months) over 8 months with a total of 24 student caregivers completing short-term internships, recording adult and child use of pointing and symbolic gestures. We used longitudinal growth models to examine change in gesturing and moderating roles of caregiver sensitivity in the relations between caregiver and child gesturing behavior. Caregivers' sensitivity moderated effects of caregivers' symbolic gestures on infants' pointing and symbolic gestures, and the effects of infants' pointing and symbolic gesture frequency on caregivers' gesture use. Thus, caregivers' gestures are most effective in supporting child gestures when in the context of sensitive interactions. Sensitivity is central to supporting children's early communicative behaviors, including pointing and symbolic gestures.

Research links parental sensitivity and cognitive stimulation to child language, but has not explicitly contrasted their effects, nor examined how effects may change over time. We examined maternal sensitivity and stimulation throughout infancy using two observational methods-ratings of parents' interaction qualities and coding of discrete parenting behaviors- to assess the relative importance of these qualities to child vocabulary over time and determine whether mothers make related changes in response to children's development. Participants were 146 infants and mothers, assessed when infants were 14, 24, and 36 months. At 14 months, sensitivity had a stronger effect on vocabulary than did stimulation, but the effect of stimulation grew throughout toddlerhood. Mothers' cognitive stimulation grew over time, whereas sensitivity remained stable. While discrete parenting behaviors changed with child age, there was no evidence of trade-offs between sensitive and stimulating behaviors, and no evidence that sensitivity moderated the effect of stimulation on child vocabulary. Findings demonstrate specificity of timing in the link between parenting qualities and child vocabulary, which could inform early parent interventions, and support a reconceptualization of the nature and measurement of parental sensitivity.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				JAN-FEB	2017	22	1					78	107		10.1111/infa.12147	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12147								28111526					WOS:000394782100006

Previous studies suggest that infants rely on information from preceding shared action contexts and joint perceptual scenes. Here, we tested whether 12-month-olds use information from act-accompanying cues, in particular prosody and hand shape, to guide their pragmatic understanding. In Experiment 1, caregivers directed infants' attention to an object to request it, share interest in it, or inform them about a hidden aspect. Caregivers used distinct prosodic and gestural patterns to express each pragmatic intention. Experiment 2 was identical except that experimenters provided identical lexical information across conditions and used three sets of trained prosodic and gestural patterns. In all conditions, the joint perceptual scenes and preceding shared action contexts were identical. In both experiments, infants reacted appropriately to the adults' intentions by attending to the object mostly in the sharing interest condition, offering the object mostly in the imperative condition, and searching for the referent mostly in the informing condition. Infants' ability to comprehend pragmatic intentions based on prosody and gesture shape expands infants' communicative understanding from common activities to novel situations for which shared background knowledge is missing.

J	Harshaw, C; Lickliter, R				Harshaw, Christopher; Lickliter, Robert			Blinking Bird Brains: A Timing Specific Deficit in Auditory Learning in Quail Hatchlings	INFANCY												Contingency perception is critical during infancy, providing the basis for the continuous learning (and re-learning) of the relation between the developing body, self-produced actions, and the environment. Nevertheless, relatively few studies have systematically examined the spatiotemporal parameters that optimize learning during development. Here, we present a series of experiments exploring a novel timing-specific deficit in auditory learning in an animal model, the bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus). In this paradigm, chicks vocalize to hear playback of an unfamiliar maternal call and are later tested for their filial preference for that call over a novel maternal call. Rather than a simple, hyperbolic decline in learning with increased delay between chick vocalization and playback, we found a window-450-900 msec after chicks ceased vocalizing-in which chicks appeared to have difficulty learning and forming a preference for the maternal call. This deficit nonetheless occurred only when the spatial location of call playback switched semi-randomly during training, suggesting an attentional explanation for this deficit. Our findings indicate that optimization of the temporal parameters in operant paradigms with infants can be complex, particularly if tasks requiring the switching of attention between spatial locations. Our findings may thus be instructive for other developmental research with infants employing operant components.

Exploring Infants' Visual Behavior during Encoding of an Elicited Imitation Task	INFANCY												Recently, there has been an increased interest in the relationship between looking time during encoding and subsequent memory performance in imitation tasks. Hitherto, the results have been inconclusive: one line of research supporting the link between looking time and performance and another line finding no relation. The existing studies may, however, have been restricted by using small samples, limited looking time measures, and short retention intervals. We here examined the relationship between the encoding process by means of looking time as well as pupil dilation (by means of eye-tracking technology) in sixty-eight 20-month-old infants participating in an elicited imitation task and their subsequent memory performance (at an encoding test and at a 2-week delayed recall test). Additional twenty-two infants provided baseline measures. Simple looking time (assessed as fixation duration) did not correlate consistently with subsequent memory measures. In some cases, however, looking time correlated negatively with imitation scores. In contrast, positive correlations were found between pupil dilation and some of the memory measures, suggesting that pupil dilation may be a more sensitive tool compared to looking time measures.

J	Mumford, KH; Kita, S				Mumford, Katherine H.; Kita, Sotaro			At 10-12 Months, Pointing Gesture Handedness Predicts the Size of Receptive Vocabularies	INFANCY												The close association between language and gesture has been widely studied (McNeill, Psychological Review, 92, 1985, 350). It remains unclear, however, when and how this relationship originates ontogenetically. This study investigated the relationship between vocabulary development and pointing handedness in 10- to 12-month-old infants. The study used cross-sectional data from 16 infants. Infants took part in a pointing elicitation task and a grasping task to assess their pointing and grasping handedness. Further, parents filled out the Oxford Communicative Development Inventory (Hamilton, Plunkett, & Schafer, Journal of Child Language, 27, 2000, 689) to assess infants' receptive and productive vocabularies. The result showed a positive, significant correlation between receptive vocabulary development and right-handed pointing. This relationship was not due to age or to vocalizations, which have not been ruled out by previous studies. Possible mechanisms behind this codevelopment are discussed.

Accumulated risk was defined as the sum-score of a selection of risk factors that have been associated with suboptimal infant development. Mother-infant dyads (N = 133) were observed during free play, two teaching tasks, and the Still-Face Paradigm (SFP). Better prenatal RF was associated with more positive maternal behavior in all settings and less negative behavior during teaching and SFP reengagement. Accumulated risk and prenatal RF predicted shared variance in maternal interactive behavior (with unique predictive effects observed only for RF on sensitivity during teaching and SFP play, and for accumulated risk on sensitivity and positive engagement during SFP play, and internalizing-helplessness during SFP reengagement). Accumulated risk had an indirect effect on maternal sensitivity during teaching and SFP play through prenatal RF. These findings suggest not only that RF may be targeted prenatally to improve mother-infant interactions, but also that enhancing RF skills may ameliorate some of the negative consequences from more stable perinatal risk factors that influence parent-child interactions.

Social Effects of Movement Synchrony: Increased Infant Helpfulness only Transfers to Affiliates of Synchronously Moving Partners	INFANCY												Interpersonal synchrony increases cooperation among adults, children, and infants. We tested whether increased infant helpfulness transfers to individuals uninvolved in the movement, but shown to be affiliates of a synchronously moving partner. Initially, 14-month-old infants (N = 48) watched a live skit by Experimenters 1 and 2 that either demonstrated affiliation or individuality. Infants in both groups were then randomly assigned to be bounced to music either synchronously or asynchronously with Experimenter 1. Infant instrumental helpfulness toward Experimenter 2 was then measured. If the two experimenters were affiliates, infants from the synchronous movement condition were significantly more helpful toward Experimenter 2 than infants from the asynchronous movement condition. However, if the two experimenters were not affiliated, synchrony effects on prosociality did not transfer to Experimenter 2. These results show the importance of musical synchrony for social interaction and suggest that infants may use an understanding of third-party social relationships when directing their own social behaviors.

Transfer of Social Learning Across Contexts: Exploring Infants' Attribution of Trait-Like Emotions to Adults	INFANCY												We explored whether 15-month-olds expect another person's emotional disposition to be stable across social situations. In three observation trials, infants watched two adults interact. Half the infants saw one of the adults ("Emoter") respond negatively to the other adult's actions (Anger group); half saw the Emoter respond neutrally to the same actions (Neutral group). After a change in social context, infants participated in novel tasks with the (now-neutral) Emoter. Infants in the Anger group were significantly more likely to relinquish desirable toys to the Emoter. We hypothesize that, in the initial observation trials, infants learned that the Emoter was "anger-prone" and expected her to get angry again in a new social situation. Consequently, infants readily gave the Emoter what she wanted. These findings reveal three key features of infants' affective cognition: (1) infants track adults' emotional history across encounters; (2) infants learn from observing how people interact with others and use this to form expectations about how these people will treat them; and (3) more speculatively, infants use appeasement to cope with social threat. We hypothesize that infants form "trait-like" attributions about people's emotional dispositions and use this to formulate adaptive responses to adults in novel social contexts.

Exploring Links among Imitation, Mental Development, and Temperament	INFANCY												Links among imitation, performance on a standardized test of intellectual development, and laboratory-assessed temperament were explored in 311 24-month-old twin pairs. Moderate phenotypic associations were found among imitation, mental development, and temperament dimensions of Affect/Extraversion and Task Orientation. Covariance between imitation and mental development reflected genetic and shared environmental influences, whereas associations between imitation and temperament reflected genetic, shared, and nonshared environmental influences. Genetic factors linking imitation and temperament were the same as those linking temperament and mental development. Nonetheless, approximately 62% of total genetic variance on imitation was independent of genetic influences on mental development and temperament, suggesting that young children's imitation is not simply an index of general cognitive ability or dispositional style but has many underlying genetic influences that are unique.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				SEP-OCT	2016	21	5					536	559		10.1111/infa.12132	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12132								27840593					WOS:000384816400001

Here we aimed to explore the relationship between maternal sensitivity during a face-to-face interaction with their infants and maternal ability in perceiving infants' body and face. Thirty-six 6 month-old infants and their mothers were videotaped during a mother-infant interaction to identify those with high and low sensitivity. Then, mothers were tested using an inversion effect paradigm requiring the visual discrimination of upright and inverted pictures of whole bodies and faces of their own and unfamiliar infants; this allowed estimation of their configural perceptual processing abilities. Results showed that high-sensitivity mothers showed reduced body configural processing for others' infants as compared to configural processing of their own infant, whereas low-sensitivity mothers were engaged in comparable body configural processing independently from infant identity. Infants' face configural processing did not distinguish between high- and low-sensitivity mothers. Our findings suggest that high-sensitivity mothers have refined their use of configural processing of body postures to be selective for their own infants, suggesting that this visuo-perceptual strategy makes much more efficient the mothers' ability in detecting, discriminating and recognizing own infant's cues.

J	Hawthorne, K; Rudat, L; Gerken, L				Hawthorne, Kara; Rudat, Lauren; Gerken, LouAnn			Prosody and the Acquisition of Hierarchical Structure in Toddlers and Adults	INFANCY												Though language manifests linearly, one word at a time, children must learn that words are embedded in constituents, which are in turn embedded in larger constituents. That is, they must learn that syntax is hierarchically structured. Prosody-speech melody and rhythm-is likewise hierarchically organized, with smaller prosodic constituents embedded in larger ones. This paper presents results showing that 20-month-olds (N = 40) can use modifier + clause prosody to learn constituents at multiple levels in a hierarchically structured artificial grammar, but that they fail to learn from clause + modifier prosody. We consider several explanations for this asymmetry, and suggest that it may be due to the frequency of the two constructions in the input. Two parallel experiments with adults suggest that older learners may not be able to learn the prosodically marked constituents. Instead, adult responses are likely based on perceptually prominent boundary words.

In particular, we extended the standard design of most segmentation studies by including a phase where infants were repeatedly exposed to target word recordings at their own home (extended exposure) in addition to a laboratory-based familiarization. This enabled us to examine infants' segmentation of words from speech input in their naturalistic environment, extending current findings to learning outside the laboratory. Results of a modified preferential-listening task show that infants listened longer to isolated tokens of familiarized words from home relative to novel control words regardless of register. However, infants showed no recognition of words exposed to during purely laboratory-based familiarization. This indicates that infants succeed in retaining words in long-term memory following extended exposure and recognizing them later on with considerable flexibility. In addition, infants segmented words from both IDS and ADS, suggesting limited effects of speech register on learning from extended exposure in naturalistic environments. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between segmentation success and infants' attention to ADS, but not to IDS, during the extended exposure phase. This finding speaks to current language acquisition models assuming that infants' individual attention to language stimuli drives successful learning.

Thirty-one infants with variable amounts of crawling experience were tested in a new paradigm that used a real cliff and a water cliff, with a harness system to guarantee safety. Consistent with previous findings obtained in studies with real and visual cliffs, infants with more crawling experience were more likely to avoid the real cliff. More importantly, greater crawling experience was associated with a greater likelihood of avoiding the water cliff.

The Case of Face-to-Face Conversation	INFANCY												This study explores 12-month-olds' understanding of face-to-face conversation, a key contextual structure associated with engagement in a social interaction. Using a violation-of-expectations paradigm, we habituated infants to a "face-to-face" conversation, and in a test phase compared their looking times between "back-to-back" (conceptually novel) and "face-to-face" (conceptually familiar) conversations, while simultaneously manipulating perceptual familiarity in a 2 x 2 factorial design. We also analyzed dynamic changes in pupil dilation, which are considered a reliable measure of cognitive load that may index processing of social interactions. Infants looked relatively longer at perceptual changes (new speaker positions) but not at conceptual change (back-to-back conversation), suggesting that face-to-face conversation may not elicit particular expectations, and so may not carry any particular conceptual significance. Moreover, on the first test trial, larger pupil dilation was observed for familiar conditions, suggesting that familiarity with perceptual features could enhance processing of conversations. Thus, this study undermines assertions regarding infants' conceptual understanding of the social signals underlying engagement. Infants may rather recognize such signals through their perceptual familiarity and associated positive feelings. This may then increase their engagement when observing and participating in others' collaborative activities, in turn allowing for the development of knowledge regarding others' intentions.

Greater Pupil Size in Response to Emotional Faces as an Early Marker of Social-Communicative Difficulties in Infants at High Risk for Autism	INFANCY												When scanning faces, individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have shown reduced visual attention (e.g., less time on eyes) and atypical autonomic responses (e.g., heightened arousal). To understand how these differences might explain subclinical variability in social functioning, 9-month-olds, with or without a family history of ASD, viewed emotionally expressive faces, and gaze and pupil diameter (a measure of autonomic activation) were recorded using eye-tracking. Infants at high risk for ASD with no subsequent clinical diagnosis (HRA-) and low-risk controls (LRC) showed similar face scanning and attention to eyes and mouth; attention was overall greater to eyes than mouth, but this varied as a function of the emotion presented. As a group, HRA-showed significantly larger pupil size than LRC. Correlations between scanning at 9 months, pupil size at 9 months, and 18-month social-communicative behavior, revealed positive associations between pupil size and attention to both face and eyes at 9 months in LRC, and a negative association between 9-month pupil size and 18-month social-communicative behavior in HRA-. The present findings point to heightened autonomic arousal in HRA-. Further, with greater arousal relating to worse social-communicative functioning at 18 months, this work points to a mechanism by which unaffected siblings might develop atypical social behavior.					nelson, charles/LBH-6397-2024; Tager-Flusberg, Helen/D-5265-2009	Wagner, Jennifer/0000-0001-8174-0534; Nelson, Charles/0000-0002-4723-247X													1525-0008	1532-7078				SEP-OCT	2016	21	5					560	581		10.1111/infa.12128	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12128								27616938					WOS:000384816400002

More recently, individual performance in such tasks has been used to predict later language development. Does this mean that dependent measures in such tasks are reliable and can stably measure speech perception skills over short time spans? Our three laboratories independently tested infants with a given task and retested them within 0-18 days. Together, we can report data from 12 new experiments (total number of paired observations N = 409), ranging from vowel and consonant discrimination to recognition of phrasal units. Results reveal that reliability is extremely variable across experiments. We discuss possible causes and implications of this variability, as well as the main effects revealed by this work. Additionally, we offer suggestions for the field of infant speech perception to improve the reliability of its methodologies through data repositories and crowd sourcing.

Participants were 150 Australian mothers (mean age 33-years) and their firstborn infants who were participating in a prospective study of parenthood. Path analysis showed maternal age had both direct and indirect associations with maternal interactive behavior. Older mothers made more mind-related comments to their infants. They were also more sensitive; however, this effect was indirect and explained by greater psychological maturity (hardiness) and a more internal locus of control with regard to parenting. Results suggest that older maternal age may confer some benefits in terms of responsive parenting in infancy.

Nevertheless, differences across dyads with respect to these resources have received little attention, as also have the factors that are responsible for such differences. This study addresses this gap in the literature by testing whether the dyad reunion patterns can be predicted by the mothers' sensitivity assessed 3 months earlier, and by the contingent degree of the matched states in the play episode. Three dyadic patterns were identified through cluster analysis, which were characterized by playful, neutrally matched, and disrupted interactions. Multinomial logistic regression shows that the mothers' sensitivity predicts membership to the playful group, and the matched states in the play episode predict membership to the neutrally matched and disrupted groups. These findings show that the vulnerability to disrupt an ongoing interaction after a temporary perturbation is seen for only some dyads; moreover, they support the view of early regulatory development as a multidetermined achievement. Overall, these findings have important theoretical implications related to the identification of early regulatory difficulties as precursors of later developmental outcomes.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				JUL-AUG	2016	21	4					453	477		10.1111/infa.12115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12115													WOS:000384816200003

Foreign Word Learning at 14 Months	INFANCY												How easily can infants regularly exposed to only one language begin to acquire a second one? In three experiments, we tested 14-month-old English and French monolingual infants' ability to learn words presented in foreign language sentence frames. Infants were trained on two novel word-object pairings and then tested using a preferential looking task. Word forms were phonetically and phonotactically legal in both languages, and cross-spliced across conditions, so only the sentence frames established the word as native or foreign. In Experiment 1, infants were taught one native and one foreign word and successfully learned both. In Experiment 2 and 3, infants were taught two foreign words, but only showed successful learning of the first word they encountered. These results demonstrate that infants can successfully learn words embedded in foreign language sentences, but this is more challenging than native word learning. More broadly, they show that the sentential context of a novel word, and not just the word form itself, influences infants' early word learning.

Peripheral distracters were presented to measure attention disengagement. It was predicted that infants would look longer at and disengage more slowly from dynamic bimodal emotion displays, especially when viewing dynamic fear. However, the results from twenty-two 10-month-olds found significantly greater attention on dynamic versus static trials, independent of emotion. Interestingly, infants looked equally to mouth and eye regions of speakers' faces except when viewing/hearing dynamic fear; in this case, they fixated more on the speakers' mouth region. Average latencies to distracters were longer on dynamic compared to static bimodal stimuli, but not differentiated by emotion. Thus, infants' attention was enhanced (in terms of both elicitation and maintenance) by dynamic, bimodal emotion displays. Results are compared to conflicting findings using static emotion displays, with suggestions for future research using more ecologically relevant dynamic, multimodal displays to gain a richer understanding of infants' processing of emotion.

Challenging Parenting Behavior from Infancy to Toddlerhood: Etiology, Measurement, and Differences between Fathers and Mothers	INFANCY												Based on evidence that fathers show more challenging and physical play than mothers, it has been theorized that fathers have a different parenting role, more focused at stimulating exploration and taking chances. Challenging parenting behavior (CPB) may foster confidence and buffer against anxiety development in children. In this study, CPB was assessed in fathers and mothers at child ages of 4 months, 1 year, and 2.5 years, using newly developed questionnaires and observational tasks. Reliability of the questionnaire and observational measures was good, and fathers' and mothers' self-rated CPB showed a similar factor structure. Modest and significant convergence between questionnaires and observations provided support for validity of CPB, whereas negative correlations with overprotection supported divergent validity. CPB correlated positively with warmth. We further found moderate to high stability of CPB from early infancy to toddlerhood, and interparental correspondence in CPB. Fathers and mothers did not differ in observed CPB, but fathers rated themselves higher than mothers in toddlerhood. It is concluded that the development of the instruments to assess CPB was successful. Overall, the results reveal similarities rather than differences between fathers' and mothers' CPB in early childhood. The potential relevance of CPB in child development and psychopathology is discussed.

Infants Associate Praise and Admonishment with Fair and Unfair Individuals	INFANCY												Recent evidence suggests that infants possess a rudimentary sensitivity to fairness: Infants expect resources to be distributed fairly and equally, and prefer individuals that distribute resources fairly over those that do so unfairly. The goal of this work was to determine whether infants' evaluations of fair and unfair individuals also includes an understanding that fair individuals are worthy of praise and unfair individuals are worthy of admonishment. After watching individuals distribute goods fairly or unfairly to recipients, 15-month-old (Experiments 1 and 2) and 13-month-old (Experiment 3) infants took part in a test phase in which they saw only the distributors' faces accompanied by praise or admonishment. Across all experiments, infants differentially shifted their visual attention to images of the fair and unfair distributors as a function of the accompanying praise or admonishment, although the direction in which they did so varied by age. Thus, by the start of the second year of life, infants appear to perceive fair individuals as morally praiseworthy and unfair individuals as morally blameworthy.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				JUL-AUG	2016	21	4					478	504		10.1111/infa.12117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12117													WOS:000384816200004

Free Viewing Gaze Behavior in Infants and Adults	INFANCY												The current study investigated age differences in free viewing gaze behavior. Adults and 6-, 9-, 12-, and 24-month-old infants watched a 60-sec Sesame Street video clip while their eye movements were recorded. Adults displayed high intersubject consistency in eye movements; they tended to fixate the same places at the same. Infants showed weaker consistency between observers and intersubject consistency increased with age. Across age groups, the influence of both bottom-up features (fixating visually salient areas) and top-down features (looking at faces) increased. Moreover, individual differences in fixating bottom-up and top-down features predicted whether infants' eye movements were consistent with those of adults, even when controlling for age. However, this relation was moderated by the number of faces available in the scene, suggesting that the development of adult-like viewing involves learning when to prioritize looking at bottom-up and top-down features.

Mothers and their 4-month-old infants were randomly assigned to one of three groups, a double FFSF group (Group(FFSF), n=44), a control, semi-structured play group (Group(Story), n=46), or a control, unstructured play group (Group(Play), n=28). As hypothesized, Group(FFSF) infants exhibited the classic SF response (decreased positive affect and gaze to mother; increased negative affect) and Group(Play) infants showed an increase in negative affect over episodes. Contrary to expectations, Group(Story) infants displayed a similar, but less intense, pattern of behavior as Group(FFSF). Taken together, the findings indicate that multiple episodes of face-to-face play exceeded 4-month-olds' regulatory capacities and that infants are sensitive to shared communicative intentions andviolations of social expectations, whether these violations are negative or positive in nature.

J	Corbeil, M; Trehub, SE; Peretz, I				Corbeil, Marieve; Trehub, Sandra E.; Peretz, Isabelle			Singing Delays the Onset of Infant Distress	INFANCY												Much is known about the efficacy of infant-directed (ID) speech and singing for capturing attention, but little is known about their role in regulating affect. In Experiment 1, infants 7-10months of age listened to scripted recordings of ID speech, adult-directed speech, or singing in an unfamiliar language (Turkish) until they met a criterion of distress based on negative facial expression. They listened to singing for roughly twice as long as speech before meeting the distress criterion. In Experiment 2, they were exposed to natural recordings of ID speech or singing in a familiar language. As in Experiment 1, ID singing was considerably more effective than speech for delaying the onset of distress. We suggest that the temporal patterning of ID singing, with its regular beat, metrical organization, and tempo, plays an important role in inhibiting distress, perhaps by promoting entrainment and predictive listening.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAY-JUN	2016	21	3					373	391		10.1111/infa.12114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12114													WOS:000374835500006

Pictures of unfamiliar male and female faces (targets) were preceded either by a central attractor (Unprimed) or by a face (Primed). In the latter case, the prime faces were either identical to the target (Repeated) or not (Unrepeated). We compared processing of primed versus unprimed faces as well as processing of repeated versus unrepeated faces. Primed stimuli elicited decreased P1 amplitude, P1 latency and N290 amplitude, indicating categorical repetition effects very early during the stream of processing. For repeated relative to unrepeated faces, N290 latency was reduced. In addition, we observed an enhanced late positivity at occipital channels for unrepeated compared to repeated male faces, but no difference for female faces. Taken together, these results suggest that 9-month-olds categorize faces before discriminating them individually. Furthermore, infants' ability to recognize face identity seems to depend on familiarity with the given face category, as indicated by differences in brain responses to male and female faces.

Participants were 142 infants (80 preterm; 62 full term) and their parents. Parent-child interactions (maternal, paternal, and co-parental) were observed at age 6months to assess parental structuring behaviors. Additionally, both parents reported on infants' temperamental reactivity. At 12months of age, infants' cognitive abilities were assessed. Consistent with the diathesis-stress model, preterm infants had lower cognitive outcomes than full-term infants when exposed to low levels of co-parental structuring, but functioned similarly when exposed to high levels of co-parental structuring. However, temperamental reactivity moderated this effect: Infants who carried one susceptibility factor (i.e., premature birth or reactive temperament) were similarly affected by co-parental structuring, whereas infants who carried two or no susceptibility factors were not. Furthermore, consistent with the differential susceptibility hypothesis, infants with highly reactive temperaments had lower cognitive functioning when exposed to low maternal structuring, but higher cognitive functioning when exposed to high maternal structuring compared to infants with lower reactivity. Results from this study highlight the importance of considering both temperamental reactivity and quality of parenting in understanding preterm infants' early cognitive vulnerability.

In Experiment 1, infants saw a distributor performing either an equal distribution where one strawberry was given to each of two recipients, or an unequal distribution that favored one of the recipients. Infants looked longer at the unequal test event, suggesting that they expected the strawberries to be distributed equally. In Experiment 2, the potential recipients were replaced with inanimate objects to rule out a lower-level alternative explanation of the results in Experiment 1 based on symmetric movement of the distributor. Infants' looking times did not reveal a preference for one of the two outcomes of the test events (i.e., symmetric or asymmetric movement). Experiment 3 controlled for the role of the distributive action, that is, here the distributors only removed barriers revealing strawberries that the recipients already had. No preference was observed when an equal or unequal initial allocation of resources was revealed. Experiment 4 assessed whether infants relied on affiliative information provided by the distributor's movements. The distributor made the same movements as in Experiment 1, but without distributing any strawberries, and no difference in looking times was observed. These findings support the view that preverbal infants expect agents to behave according to a simple principle: Resources are to be distributed equally among equivalent recipients. We discuss the possible links between such reactions and the emergence of an early sense of fairness.

Results indicated that maternal sensitivity at 5months was not directly associated with behavioral regulation at 10months. However, greater maternal sensitivity at 5months was associated with greater vagal withdrawal at 10months, after controlling for vagal withdrawal at 5months. Further, vagal withdrawal at 10months was associated with greater orientation toward the mother at 10months, after controlling for 5-month orientation behaviors. The indirect effect of maternal sensitivity on maternal-orientation behaviors was significant, suggesting that infant's vagal withdrawal may be one potential mechanism through which maternal sensitivity is related to behavioral regulation.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAR-APR	2016	21	2					128	153		10.1111/infa.12101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12101								27019648					WOS:000370250100001

Henny			Developmental Change in Infants' Detection of Visual Faces that Match Auditory Vowels	INFANCY												Infants demonstrate robust audiovisual (AV) perception, detecting, for example, which visual face matches auditory speech in many paradigms. For simple phonetic segments, like vowels, previous work has assumed developmental stability in AV matching. This study shows dramatic differences in matching performance for different vowels across the first year of life: 3-, 6-, and 9-month-olds were familiarized for 40sec with a visual face articulating a vowel in synchrony with auditory presentations of that vowel, but crucially, the mouth of the face was occluded. At test, infants were shown two still photos of the same face without occlusion for 1min in silence. One face had a static articulatory configuration matching the previously heard vowel, while the other face had a static configuration matching a different vowel. Three auditory vowels were used: /a/,/i/, and /u/. Results suggest that AV matching performance varies according to age and to the familiarized vowel. Interestingly, results are not linked to the frequency of vowels in auditory input, but may instead be related to infants' ability to produce the target vowel. A speculative hypothesis is that vowel production in infancy modulates AV vowel matching.

Nevertheless, few studies have been conducted with toddlers attending nursery school. In this study, we adopted observational and experimental paradigms to examine the efficacy of an intervention based on conversing about emotions with small groups of 2- to 3-year-old children. The intervention was designed to promote toddlers' mental-state talk, emotion understanding (EU), and prosocial behavior. The training group significantly outperformed the control group in the use of mental-state language, especially emotional-state lexicon, EU, and prosocial behavior toward peers. There was also a significant GroupxAge interaction, with the older training group participants displaying greater gains in EU than the younger ones.

Infants aged 12 and 15months were habituated to two agents pursuing two different objects and then tested with one agent (the communicator) interacting with a new agent (the recipient), whereas the other agent (the noncommunicator) did not interact with anyone. Results showed that 15-month-olds looked for longer when the recipient reached toward the preferred object of the noncommunicator in contrast to that of the communicator, suggesting that they recognized information transmitted from the communicator (versus the noncommunicator) to the recipient. Furthermore, the information was perceived as being specifically transmitted between agents, and this inference was not driven by the low-level perceptual factors of the communicator or the communication itself. However, 12-month-old infants did not show an understanding of transmission between the agents. The selective understanding of information transmitted among multiple agents, and the critical role of agency in such understanding are discussed.

INFANCY												The preference of infants to fixate on social information in a stimulus is well known. We examine how this preference manifests across a series of free-viewing tasks using different stimulus types. Participants were thirty typically developing infants. We measured eye movements when viewing isolated faces, faces alongside objects in a grid, and faces naturally presented in photographed scenes. In each task, infants fixated social content for longer than nonsocial content. Social preference scores representing distribution of fixation to social versus general image content were highly correlated and thus combined into a single composite measure, which was independent of demographic and behavioral measures. We infer that multiple eye-tracking tasks can be used to generate a composite measure of social preference in infancy. This approach may prove useful in the early characterization of developmental disabilities.

We tested a single age group (4-month-olds) undergoing rapid development of attention orienting mechanisms. Infants completed a spatial cueing task designed to elicit IOR, in which cat or dog category exemplars consistently appeared in either the cued or noncued locations. Infants were subsequently tested on a visual paired comparison of exemplars from these cued and noncued animal categories. As expected, infants showed either facilitation-based orienting or the more mature IOR-based orienting during spatial cueing/encoding. Infants who demonstrated IOR-based orienting showed memory for both specific exemplars and broader category learning, whereas those who showed facilitation-based orienting showed weaker evidence of learning. Attention orienting also interacted with previous pet experience, such that the number of pets at home influenced learning only when infants engaged facilitation-based orienting during encoding. Learning in the context of IOR-based orienting was stable regardless of pet experience, suggesting that selective attention serves as an online learning mechanism during visual exploration that is less sensitive to prior experience.

Twenty-four-month-olds (N=36) searched for a sticker on a felt board after watching an experimenter hide it behind a felt object in person or via video. Eye movements during the hiding event were recorded. Compared to those watching in-person events, children watching video spent more time looking at the target location overall, yet they had relatively poor search performance. Visual attention to the target location predicted search performance in the video condition only; children who watched in-person hiding events had high success rates even if they paid relatively little visual attention to the correct location. Findings are consistent with the hypothesis that toddlers process information more quickly for in-person (versus video) events, enabling them to learn as well (or better) despite relatively low selective attention. Thus, relatively poor encoding, as well as memory retrieval, may underlie the video deficit.

Mothers' Verbal and Nonverbal Strategies in Relation to Infants' Object-Directed Actions in Real Time and Across the First ThreeYears in Ethnically Diverse Families	INFANCY												We examined maternal behavioral strategies in relation to infants' object-directed actions in real time and over developmental time in 206 mother-infant dyads from African American, Dominican immigrant, and Mexican immigrant backgrounds. Mothers were asked to share a set of beads and strings with their infants when children were 14, 24, and 36months. We coded three types of maternal strategieseliciting attention, instructive assistance, and encouragementwhich could be expressed verbally (e.g., look, turn it, good job!) or physically (i.e., through gestures, hands-on guidance, or transfer of objects). We also coded infants' unassisted bead-stringing. Across ethnic groups and ages, mothers' hands-on guidance and object transfer increased the likelihood that infants would follow with unassisted bead-stringing during real-time interaction. Over developmental time, mothers modified their strategies: They displayed fewer attention-getting strategies and more encouragement across infant ages, and peaked in their provision of instructive assistance when infants were 24months. Additionally, Mexican mothers displayed more nonverbal strategies (e.g., gestures, hands-on guidance) than did African American and/or Dominican mothers, who displayed more verbal strategies (e.g., attention-getting and encouraging language). Developmental and real-time patterns in mother-infant object-related interactions generalize across ethnicities, although mothers' emphases on specific strategies are culture specific.

J	Galazka, M; Nyström, P				Galazka, Martyna; Nystrom, Par			Visual Attention to Dynamic Spatial Relations in Infants and Adults	INFANCY												Previous research has found that kinematic features of interactions, such as spatial proximity, capture adult visual attention. The current research uses online measures of gaze behavior to determine attentional capture to objects with reduced interobject spacing in adults as well as infants at 5 and 12months. The three age groups observed three identical geometrical shapes that moved randomly. Relative distance between the objects was mapped and intervals of high and low spatial proximity were identified. Findings demonstrate that only adults and 12-month-olds look significantly more at the objects that are close during instances of high spatial proximity, while 5-month-olds look at chance. The findings speak for a developmental trend in oculomotor processes, where a bias to look at objects with high spatial proximity develops within the first year of life.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				JAN-FEB	2016	21	1					90	103		10.1111/infa.12091	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12091													WOS:000368719000005

I Don't Like the Tone of Your Voice: Infants Use Vocal Affect to Socially Evaluate Others	INFANCY												Infants can make social judgments about characters by visually observing their interactions with others (e.g., Hamlin, Wynn & Bloom, Nature, 2007, 450, 557). Here, we ask whether infants can form similar judgments about potential social partners based solely on their tone of voice. In Experiment 1, we presented 10.5-month-olds with two visually neutral puppets. One puppet spoke in a positive affect and the other spoke in a negative affect. When the puppets were placed within reach of the infants, infants selected the formerly positive puppet. This preference disappeared when the voices were paired with nonsocial objects (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, 10.5-month-olds were once again exposed to the same emotionally negative and positive voices. However, no visual characters were present. At test, infants' visual orientation controlled how long they heard the neutral versions of each voice. Here, infants listened longer to the neutral voice of the formerly positive speaker. That is, just as in Experiment 1, infants' preferences for the emotionally neutral test stimuli were shaped by their earlier exposure to emotionally charged recordings of that voice. Our findings provide convergent evidence to suggest that infants possess sophisticated social evaluation abilities, preferring to interact with prosocial over antisocial others.

Infant-Mother and Infant-Caregiver Emotional Relationships: Process Analyses of Interactions in Three Contemporary Childcare Arrangements	INFANCY												Emotional relationships in infant-mother dyads in families where mothers provided full-time childcare were compared with those of families where mothers used in-home childcare providers and family childcare providers (N=245). Infant relationships with childcare providers were also studied. Emotional relationships were adequate in all three childcare arrangements, but infant-mother dyads in in-home childcare arrangements displayed healthier emotional relationships than infant-mother dyads in mother care arrangements; no differences in the health of emotional relationships with infants emerged among the three types of childcare providers (mother care, in-home childcare, family childcare). Infant-mother dyads in in-home childcare arrangements also displayed healthier emotional relationships than infant-in-home childcare caregiver dyads, but infant-mother and infant-caregiver dyads were comparable in family childcare families. Emotional relationships in infant-mother and infant-caregiver dyads were not correlated, regardless of the type of childcare.

C.; Nystrom, Marcus; Kemner, Chantal			Consequences of Eye Color, Positioning, and Head Movement for Eye-Tracking Data Quality in Infant Research	INFANCY												Eye tracking has become a valuable tool for investigating infant looking behavior over the last decades. However, where eye-tracking methodology and achieving high data quality have received a much attention for adult participants, it is unclear how these results generalize to infant research. This is particularly important as infants behave different from adults in front of the eye tracker. In this study, we investigated whether eye physiology, positioning, and infant behavior affect measures of eye-tracking data quality: accuracy, precision, and data loss. We report that accuracy and precision are lower, and more data loss occurs for infants with bluish eye color compared to infants with brownish eye color. Moreover, accuracy was lower for infants positioned in a high chair or in the parents' lap compared to infants positioned in a baby seat. Finally, precision decreased and data loss increased as a function of time. We highlight the importance of data quality when comparing multiple groups, as differences in data quality can affect eye-tracking measures. In addition, we investigate how two different measures to quantify infant movement influence eye-tracker data quality. These findings might help researchers with data collection and help manufacturers develop better eye-tracking systems for infants.

We presented infants with short cartoons in which a character (the Protoganist) engaged in a ball play with two others, one acting prosocially (the Giver), and the other antisocially (the Keeper). Afterward, infants were presented with the Giver and the Keeper characters and encouraged to reach for the one of their choices. We found that infants exhibited robust choice for the Giver. In addition, infants' preference for the Giver persisted despite changes in facial features (dark skin, scrambled face). These findings provide further evidence for infant's preference for prosociality.

J	Maurer, D				Maurer, Daphne			What Atypical Adults Can Teach Us about Development	INFANCY												In my presidential address, I described the early trap I fell into of describing the super-baby capable of one after another adult perceptual ability, then how I discovered that two atypical populations of adults allowed me to study developmental mechanisms, namely, the role of early sensory input in sculpting the nervous system and the biological preparedness that constrains the experiential effects. Specifically, studies of adults who had dense central cataracts during childhood revealed that there are multiple critical periods during which visual input alters the potential of the nervous system for later refinement. Studies of adults with synesthesia generated novel hypotheses, subsequently supported experimentally, about the details of the biological preparedness that bias the child's early learning. Nevertheless, later studies indicated that considerable residual plasticity remains in adulthood.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV-DEC	2015	20	6					587	600		10.1111/infa.12106	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12106													WOS:000362686200001

We examined whether it relates to the quality of the interactions between infants born preterm and their mothers. Thirty-nine healthy infants born preterm (M-age in weeks=14.59, SD=2.21; 38.46% female) and their mothers participated in the study. Infants' quality of spontaneous movements was assessed using the General Movement Assessment according to Prechtl (Prechtl, Early Human Development 1990, 23, 151). A new measurement was employed to evaluate the following aspects of the mother-infant interaction: maternal sensitivity in the motor modality (i.e., when touching, picking up, holding, and putting down the infant), maternal sensitivity in the modalities of vocalization and eye contact, and infants' positive engagement. Several aspects of infants' quality of movements were associated with maternal sensitivity in the motor modality and infants' positive engagement, but not with maternal sensitivity in the modalities of vocalization and eye contact. These findings suggest that the quality of infants' spontaneous movements may explain some of the variability in the interactions between infants born preterm and their mothers. The results also highlight the importance of differentiating between the modalities of mothers' behavior when assessing their sensitivity. Implications for research and practice with families of preterm infants are discussed.

We investigated the developmental emergence of the ability to perceive the coherence of auditory and visual attributes of gender in 6- and 9-month-old infants. Infants viewed two side-by-side video clips of a man and a woman singing a nursery rhyme and heard a synchronous male or female sound track. Results showed that 6-month-old infants did not match the audible and visible attributes of gender, and 9-month-old infants matched only female faces and voices. These findings indicate that the ability to perceive the multisensory coherence of gender emerges relatively late in infancy and that it reflects the greater experience that most infants have with female faces and voices.

J	van Heugten, M; Christophe, A				van Heugten, Marieke; Christophe, Anne			Infants' Acquisition of Grammatical Gender Dependencies	INFANCY												To successfully understand spoken language, listeners need to determine how words within sentences relate to one another. Although the ability to compute relationships between word categories is known to develop early in life, little research has been conducted on infants' early sensitivity to subcategorical dependencies, such as those evoked by grammatical gender (where the article form is dictated by the noun's gender). This study therefore examines whether French-learning 18-month-olds track such relationships. Using the Visual Fixation Procedure, infants were presented with article-noun sequences in which the gender-marked article either matched (e.g., la(FEM)poussette(FEM) the stroller) or mismatched (e.g., le(MASC)poussette(FEM)) the gender of the noun. A clear preference for correct over incorrect co-occurrences was observed, suggesting that by 18months of age, children's storage and access of words is sufficiently sophisticated to include the means to track subcategorical dependencies. This early sensitivity to gender information may be greatly beneficial for constraining lexical access during online language processing.					van Heugten, Marieke/AAQ-2576-2021; Christophe, Anne/B-9797-2008	Christophe, Anne/0000-0001-7695-7528; van Heugten, Marieke/0000-0002-4758-2314													1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV-DEC	2015	20	6					675	683		10.1111/infa.12094	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12094													WOS:000362686200005

Here, we present data from 5-, 7-, and 10-month-old infants using the Infant Orienting With Attention (IOWA) task, designed to capture developmental changes in visual spatial attention and saccade planning. Results indicate rapid development of spatial attention and visual response competition between 5 and 10 months. We use a dynamic neural field (DNF) model to link behavioral findings to neural population activity, providing a possible mechanistic explanation for observed developmental changes. Together, the behavioral and model simulation results provide new insights into the specific mechanisms that underlie spatial cueing effects, visual competition, and visual interference in infancy.

Vocal Coordination During Early Parent-Infant Interactions Predicts Language Outcome in Infant Siblings of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder	INFANCY												This study examined vocal coordination during mother-infant interactions in the infant siblings (high-risk infants; HR) of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a population at heightened risk for developing language delays (LDs). Vocal coordination between mothers and HR infants was compared to a group of low-risk (LR; no first- or second-degree relative with ASD) dyads and used to predict later language development. Nine-month-old infants were video-taped at home playing with their mothers, and interactions were coded for the frequency and timing of vocalizations. Percent infant simultaneous speech was predictive of later LD, and dyads with LD infants were less coordinated with one another in average latency to respond than dyads with non-delayed (ND) infants. The degree of coordination between mothers and infants on this variable predicted a continuous measure of language development in the third year. This research underscores the importance of understanding early development in the context of interaction.

One is Not Enough: Multiple Exemplars Facilitate Infants' Generalizations of Novel Properties	INFANCY												Across three experiments, we examined 9- and 11-month-olds' mappings of novel sound properties to novel animal categories. Infants were familiarized with novel animal-novel sound pairings (e.g., Animal A [red]-Sound 1) and then tested on: (1) their acquisition of the original pairing and (2) their generalization of the sound property to a new member of a familiarized category (e.g., Animal A [blue]-Sound 1). When familiarized with a single exemplar of a category, 11-month-olds showed no evidence of acquiring or generalizing the animal-sound pairings. In contrast, 11-month-olds learnt the original animal-sound mappings and generalized the sound property to a novel member of that category when familiarized with multiple exemplars of a category. Finally, when familiarized with multiple exemplars, 9-month-old infants learnt the original animal-sound pairing, but did not extend the novel sound property. The results of these experiments provide evidence for developmental differences in the facilitative role of multiple exemplars in promoting the learning and generalization of information.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				SEP-OCT	2015	20	5					548	575		10.1111/infa.12092	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12092													WOS:000358863800004

The present study is the first to extend this central principle of the intersensory redundancy hypothesis (IRH) to certain types of intrasensory redundancy (stimulation synchronized within a single sense). Infants were habituated to videos of a toy hammer tapping silently (unimodal control), depicting intersensory redundancy (synchronized with a soundtrack) or intrasensory redundancy (synchronized with another visual event; light flashing or bat tapping). In Experiment 1, 2-month-olds showed both intersensory and intrasensory facilitation (with respect to the unimodal control) for detecting a change in tempo. However, intrasensory facilitation was found when the hammer was synchronized with the light flashing (different motion) but not with the bat tapping (same motion). Experiment 2 tested 3-month-olds using a somewhat easier tempo contrast. Results supported a similarity hypothesis: intrasensory redundancy between two dissimilar events was more effective than that between two similar events for promoting processing of amodal properties. These findings extend the IRH and indicate that in addition to intersensory redundancy, intrasensory redundancy between two synchronized dissimilar visual events is also effective in promoting perceptual processing of amodal event properties.

Infants (69 months) were habituated to a self-propelled circle jumping over an obstacle to reach a goal. When the obstacle was removed, infants who crawled (n = 13) showed longer looking time to the familiar but now nonrational jumping path versus a novel but rational straight-line path. Noncrawlers (n = 17) did not discriminate. Looking preference was independent of age and speed of habituation. These findings support the claim that infants' processing of agency emerges early and applies to all agents, but stress the role of experience in the development of action interpretation.

J	Liszkowski, U; Ramenzoni, VC				Liszkowski, Ulf; Ramenzoni, Veronica C.			Pointing to Nothing? Empty Places Prime Infants' Attention to Absent Objects	INFANCY												People routinely point to empty space when referring to absent entities. These points to "nothing" are meaningful because they direct attention to places that stand in for specific entities. Typically, the meaning of places in terms of absent referents is established through preceding discourse and accompanying language. However, it is unknown whether nonlinguistic actions can establish locations as meaningful places, and whether infants have the capacity to represent a place as standing in for an object. In a novel eye-tracking paradigm, 18-month-olds watched objects being placed in specific locations. Then, the objects disappeared and a point directed infants' attention to an emptied place. The point to the empty place primed infants in a subsequent scene (in which the objects appeared at novel locations) to look more to the object belonging to the indicated place than to a distracter referent. The place-object expectations were strong enough to interfere when reversing the place-object associations. Findings show that infants comprehend nonlinguistic reference to absent entities, which reveals an ontogenetic early, nonverbal understanding of places as representations of absent objects.

Maternal depression is a well-known risk factor for disrupting mother-infant interactions, but findings regarding gaze behavior in infants of depressed versus nondepressed mothers have been ambiguous. In this study, we examined gaze duration and activity in a sample of 27 infants of mothers with postpartum depression (PPD) and 49 infants of nondepressed mothers. Maternal depressive symptoms were assessed with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, and diagnoses were confirmed in clinical interview. Infant gaze was assessed during 4-month face-to-face interactions using continuous timed-event coding with high temporal resolution. Although we found no differences in gaze duration, infants of PPD mothers had both significantly less Gaze On and also less Gaze Off events. Findings suggest that PPD is related to reduced gaze activity during mother-infant interaction in 4-month-olds. This reduced activity may have long-term negative consequences for child development.

We test whether instructional capital (caregiver education) leads to improved infant growth through availability of physical capital (household resources) across a wide swath of low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Using the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, we explore relations among caregiver education, household resources, and infant (M age = 0.99 years) growth in 117,881 families living in 39 LMIC. Overall, household resources mediated 76% of the small association between caregiver education and infant growth. When disaggregated by countries characterized by low, medium, and high levels of human development (as indexed by average life expectancy, education, and gross domestic product), household resources mediated 48-78% of the association between caregiver education and infant growth. Caregiver education had effects on infant growth through household resources in countries characterized by low, medium, and high levels of human development; for girls and boys; and controlling for indexes of infant feeding and health.

A Missed Opportunity for Clarity: Problems in the Reporting of Effect Size Estimates in Infant Developmental Science	INFANCY												Several years ago, the American Psychological Association began requiring that effect size estimates be reported to provide a better indication of the associative strength between factors and dependent measures in empirical studies (Publication manual of the American Psychological Association, 2010, Author, Washington, DC). Accordingly, developmental journals require/strongly recommend effect size estimates be included in published work. Potentially, this trend has important benefits for infancy research given some of the inherent difficulties in establishing conceptually strong findings when often facing highly variable performance in typically small samples. This study examined recent infant research from select journals for accuracy and interpretative value of effect size estimates. Demographics, sample size, design, and statistical data were coded from 158 published (2007-2012) articles presenting 878 effect size estimates from experimental findings with infants using behavioral methods. Descriptive and distribution statistics were calculated for the following variables: (1) statistical tests, (2) effect size parameters, and (3) effect size interpretations. Although partial eta squared (eta(2)(p)) and eta squared (eta(2)) were most common (49 and 42%, respectively), "eta confusion" was apparent, and interpretation of effect size estimates was virtually nonexistent. Thus, effect size estimates are not impacting infant development research in spite of criticisms of sole dependence on null hypothesis (e.g. American Psychologist, 49, 1994 and 997). Suggestions for increasing accuracy of effect size estimate selection and interpretative effect size estimate cutoffs are offered to improve empirical clarity.

While human newborns are capable of detecting the temporal synchrony of visuo-tactile body-related cues, it remains unknown whether they also utilise spatial information for body perception. Twenty newborns were presented with a video of an infant's face touched with a paintbrush, while their own face was touched either in the spatially congruent, or an incongruent, location. We found that newborns show a visual preference for spatially congruent synchronous events, supporting the view that newborns have a rudimentary sense of their own body.

J	Ference, J; Curtin, S				Ference, Jennifer; Curtin, Suzanne			The Ability to Map Differentially Stressed Labels to Objects Predicts Language Development at 24 months in 12-month-olds at High Risk for Autism	INFANCY												Sensitivity to language-specific stress patterns during infancy facilitates finding, mapping, and recognizing words, and early preferences for the predominate stress pattern of the infant's native language have been argued to facilitate language relevant outcomes (Ference & Curtin, 2013 Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 116, 891; Weber etal., 2005 Cognitive Brain Research, 25, 180). We examined 12-month-old infant siblings of typically developing children (SIBS-TD) and infant siblings of children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; SIBS-A) on their ability to map differentially stressed labels to objects. We also examined whether success at this task relates to infants' vocabulary size at 12months, and more specifically to SIBS-A's vocabulary at both 12 and 24months. SIBS-TD successfully mapped the word-object pairings, which related to their vocabulary comprehension at 12months. In contrast, SIBS-A as a group did not map the word-object pairings, which was unrelated to vocabulary size at 12months. However, success on this task for SIBS-A predicted expressive language abilities at 24months using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL; Mullen, 1995 Mullen Scales of Early Learning. Circle Pines, MN: American Guidance) and the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (MB-CDI; Fenson etal., 1993 MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory: Users Guide and Technical Manual. San Diego, CA: Singular Publishing Company). Our study is the first to demonstrate that 12-month-old SIBS-A who succeed at word mapping using lexical stress are more likely to have stronger expressive language abilities at 24months.

Five-month-old infants and their mothers engaged in a Still-Face Task in which the mother's mirroring of the infant's behavior was assessed. After the task, the mother was shown a video of her infant in the task and asked to comment on what was happening for her infant; her comments were assessed for mind-mindedness. Maternal mind-mindedness when mothers were asked to reflect upon what was happening for their infants during the task predicted mothers' mirroring behaviors while engaged with their infants in the task. Maternal mirroring behavior may be a manifestation of maternal mentalization that is salient to infants.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAY-JUN	2015	20	3					263	282		10.1111/infa.12079	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12079													WOS:000352492600003
J	He, MX; Walle, EA; Campos, JJ				He, Minxuan; Walle, Eric A.; Campos, Joseph J.			A Cross-National Investigation of the Relationship Between Infant Walking and Language Development	INFANCY												The acquisition of walking has recently been linked with infant language development (Walle & Campos, 2014). If this relation reflects the consequence of an epigenetic event, then it should be present regardless of when the infant typically begins to walk, the infant's culture, and the infant's native language. This study sought to replicate the previously reported link between walking and language development in American infants and investigate whether this relation exists cross-nationally in typically developing Chinese infants exposed to Mandarin. Urban Chinese infants not only provide a distinct linguistic and cultural population in which to study this relation but also typically begin walking approximately 6weeks later than American infants. Our results demonstrated that (1) walking infants in both the American and Chinese samples had greater receptive and productive vocabularies than same-aged crawling infants, (2) differences between crawling and walking infants were proportionally similar in each sample, and (3) the walking-language relation was present for both noun and non-noun vocabularies. These findings provide further support of a relation between infant walking onset and language development, independent of age. Avenues for future research of the processes involved in this relation, as well as additional populations of interest to investigate, are discussed.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAY-JUN	2015	20	3					283	305		10.1111/infa.12071	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12071													WOS:000352492600004

Complex Interrelations of Trait Vulnerabilities in Mothers and their Infants	INFANCY												Despite the developmental and clinical relevance of this area of inquiry, no studies have examined the interrelations of trait vulnerabilities in the affective, behavioral, and interpersonal domains between mothers and their infants. Thus, this study examined the interrelations of three trait vulnerabilities (i.e., negative affective intensity, impulsivity, and insecure attachment) between mothers and their 12- to 23-month-old infants, focusing in particular on the unique and interactive influence of these maternal trait vulnerabilities on the expression of and precursors to these traits in their infants. Mother-infant dyads (N=101) completed several laboratory procedures, and mothers reported on their own and their infants' expressions of the trait vulnerabilities of interest. Findings from this study provide preliminary evidence for intergenerational relations between these traits and suggest that it is the confluence of trait vulnerabilities in mothers that relates to the early expression of some of these traits in infants.

Infant Preferences for Structural and Prosodic Properties of Infant-Directed Speech in the Second Year of Life	INFANCY												While a large literature discusses young infants' preference for an infant-directed speaking style, few studies have explored preferences after the first year. The present work compares infants' preference for two different properties of IDS speech: prosodic changes (primarily pitch and pitch variability) and structural properties (utterance length; lexical repetition). We found that both 12- and 16-month-old infants continued to prefer listening to speech with the prosodic properties of IDS, but neither age showed any preference for speech with the lexical repetition and short utterances typical of IDS.

Trajectories of Regulatory Behaviors in Early Infancy: Determinants of Infant Self-Distraction and Self-Comforting	INFANCY												The ability to effectively regulate emotions is an important marker for early socio-emotional development. The uses of self-comforting behaviors and self-distraction have been empirically supported as effective regulatory strategies for infants, although research on determinants of such behaviors is scarce. Thus, a more thorough examination of the development of regulatory behaviors is needed. For the current study, 135 mothers, fathers, and their infants participated in laboratory visits at 3, 5, and 7months of age where parent sensitivity and infant regulatory strategies were coded from the Still-Face Paradigm. Parents also filled out questionnaires about infant temperament and parental involvement. Using multilevel modeling to examine levels and trajectories of self-comforting and self-distraction, the current study found: (1) infants higher in temperamental surgency used more self-distraction and self-comforting, (2) infants lower in surgency with highly involved parents increased in self-distraction at a faster rate, particularly with highly involved fathers, and (3) infants used self-comforting more than average with fathers when the infant was also lower in temperamental regulation. In addition, we examined trajectories of parent involvement and temperament in relation to infant regulatory strategy.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAR-APR	2015	20	2					129	159		10.1111/infa.12068	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12068								25685094					WOS:000348505900001

Study aims included the following: (1) determining whether fearful shyness predicted self-conscious shyness, (2) describing development of self-conscious shyness, and (3) examining genetic and environmental contributions to fearful and self-conscious shyness. Observed self-conscious shyness was examined at 19, 22, 25, and 28months in same-sex twins (MZ = 102, DZ = 111, missing zygosity = 3 pairs). Self-conscious shyness increased across toddlerhood, but onset was earlier than predicted by theory. Fearful shyness (observed [6 and 12months] and parents' reports [12 and 22months]) was not predictive of self-conscious shyness. Independent genetic factors made strong contributions to parent-reported (but not observed) fearful shyness (additive genetic influence = .69 and .72 at 12 and 22months, respectively) and self-conscious shyness (additive genetic influence = .90 for the growth model intercept). Results encourage future investigation of patterns of change and inter-relations in shyness subtypes.

Following familiarization with either plastic or wooden animal replicas, infants were tested with objects of both materials in a standard object-examining task. Both US and Malawian infants demonstrated category formation regardless of the material of the animal replicas. In addition, infants extended a category of plastic animals to novel wooden animals, but did not extend a category of wooden animals to novel plastic animals. These findings document a uniform impact of stimuli characteristics on infant object categorization despite differences in infant cultural background and toy animal experience. In addition, they show that, in some cases, infants can generalize their categorization of animals from one type of replica to another.

J	Segal, O; Keren-Portnoy, T; Vihman, M				Segal, Osnat; Keren-Portnoy, Tamar; Vihman, Marilyn			Infant Recognition of Hebrew Vocalic Word Patterns	INFANCY												The ability of infants to recognize phonotactic patterns in their native language is widely acknowledged. However, the specific ability of infants to recognize patterns created by nonadjacent vowels in words has seldom been investigated. In Semitic languages such as Hebrew, groups of multisyllabic words are identical in their nonadjacent vowel sequences and stress position but differ in the consonants interposed between the vowels. The goals of this study were to assess whether infants learning Hebrew show a preference for (1) a nonadjacent vocalic pattern or template, common in Hebrew nouns (CeCeC), over a nonattested nonadjacent vocalic pattern (CoCoC), and (2) a nonadjacent vocalic pattern common in Hebrew words (CaCoC) over an existing but less common pattern (CaCeC). Twenty Hebrew-learning infants aged 8 to 11months were presented with lists of nonsense words featuring the first two patterns (Experiment 1), and 20 were presented with nonsense words featuring the second two patterns (Experiment 2). The results showed longer listening to CeCeC than to CoCoC lists and to CaCoC than to CaCeC lists, suggesting that infants recognized the common nonadjacent vocalic patterns in both cases. The study thus demonstrates that Hebrew-learning infants are able to disregard the intervening consonants within words and generalize their vocalic pattern to previously unheard nonwords, whether this pattern includes identical or different vowels and regardless of the rhythmic pattern of the word (trochaic or iambic). Analysis of the occurrence of the relevant vowel patterns in input speech in three Hebrew corpora (two addressed to children and one to adults) suggests that exposure to these patterns in words underlies the infants' preferences.

Body Structure Perception in Infancy	INFANCY												Structural cues, such as the relative size and arrangement of parts, are key aspects of adults' representation of human bodies, and they are used to derive significant social information such as age, sex, and attractiveness. Prior studies have not clearly addressed young infants' sensitivity to these body characteristics. In the current experiments, 3.5-month-olds exhibited a preference between images of intact bodies versus those with parts in wrong locations. Infants also discriminated between intact bodies and those with distorted part proportions. In both cases, infants discriminated when images were presented upright but not when they were inverted. These results indicate that infants are sensitive to the arrangement and size of human body parts at least by 3.5months of age. Thus, contrary to some prior reports, body representation early in life is developed enough to include structural information.

Here, in the largest eye-tracking test of relational memory to date (n=276), we replicate these findings and examine the impact of excluding data based on looking behavior characteristics at test. Past work examining infants' preferential looking toward arbitrary-paired objects and scenes has excluded infants from analysis based upon insufficient looking at test. Yet, research suggests that variation in looking behavior may be associated with looking patterns during encoding, as well as trait-like differences in visual and cognitive processing. Similar to past research, we observed evidence for relational memory among 6-month-olds. In keeping with past research, when infants were excluded based on insufficient looking, we observed evidence for relational memory only when infants were tested immediately. However, when exclusion criteria were relaxed, infants specifically demonstrated preferential looking during a presumably more difficult delay-plus-interference condition. Moreover, analyses revealed that looking behavior during encoding was associated with looking behavior at test. Together, results suggest that infants do possess rudimentary relational memory capabilities, but that experimenters' ability to detect these capabilities is influenced by both experimental conditions and individual differences in looking behavior.

INFANCY												Early childhood behavior problems may indicate risk for subsequent psychopathology (Shaw, Gilliom, Ingoldsby, & Nagin, Developmental Psychology, 39, 2003, 189). There is some evidence to suggest that boys and girls may be differentially susceptible to postpartum risk factors that predict problem behaviors in early childhood (Kochanska, Coy, & Murray, Child Development, 72, 2001, 1091; Martel, Klump, Nigg, Breedlove, & Sisk, Hormones and Behavior , 55, 2009, 465). The main aim of this study is to examine whether child sex moderates the effect of infant and maternal predictors of toddler problem behaviors in a unique sample of high-risk mother-child dyads. Analyses were based on data collected for 198 mother-child dyads (52% male offspring) followed longitudinally from birth to 18months. Maternal and infant variables, including maternal PTSD and depression symptoms, maternal maltreatment history, observed maternal parenting quality, demographic risk, and infant negative emotionality and night waking, were used to predict toddler behavior problems. Although boys and girls displayed similar levels of total problem behaviors at 18months overall, the specific set of infant and maternal variables that predicted toddler problems varied by child sex. The significant predictor for boys was maternal PTSD symptoms, whereas significant predictors for girls were infant negative emotionality and sleep problems. Results suggest that sex-differentiated transmission of risk can be identified as early as 18months postpartum.

After viewing a sequence of actions performed by two people who socially interact, 18-month-olds bound together the socially engaged actors' actions such that they later expected the actors to share the same final goal. Eighteen-month-olds who saw nonsocially engaged actors did not have this expectation and neither did 14-month-olds when viewing either socially or nonsocially engaged actors. The results are discussed in light of the possibility that experience in collaborations could be necessary for understanding collaboration from a third-person perspective.					; Gredeback, Gustaf/C-1676-2009	Fawcett, Christine/0000-0002-0898-9920; Gredeback, Gustaf/0000-0003-3046-0043													1525-0008	1532-7078				JAN-FEB	2015	20	1					115	125		10.1111/infa.12062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12062								26640417					WOS:000346173800006

Toddlers' Responses to Infants' Negative Emotions	INFANCY												Early developments in toddlers' responses to adults' distress have been extensively examined, but less work has been directed to young children's responses to other children in distress. In the current study, we examined 12-, 18-, and 24-month-old children's (N=71) behavioral and affective responses to a crying infant (doll) present in the room with the child. A comparison condition included a contented, neutral infant to contrast with the crying infant so as to disambiguate social interest from distress-specific responding. Results showed that 12-month-olds were neither particularly interested in nor concerned about the infant, although they did discriminate between conditions. In contrast, 18- and 24-month-olds were socially interested and attentive to the infant, but 24-month-olds exhibited greater affective concern to the crying infant than did 18-month-olds. Children at all three ages were also mildly distressed themselves by the infant's crying, and this did not decline over the second year. Both girls and children without siblings were more interested in the infant; no effects were found for gender, daycare experience, or siblings on affective concern.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				JAN-FEB	2015	20	1					70	97		10.1111/infa.12066	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12066													WOS:000346173800004

Typical and Atypical Development of Visual Attention in 3-to 9-Month-Old Infants	INFANCY												The interactions between attention and stimulus encoding in infancy were examined using heart rate (HR) and visual habituation measures. At 3, 6, and 9 months of age, infants (N = 119) were habituated to an adult face; longest look (LL) duration was measured as an indicator of encoding speed. Three groups were formed based on LL change from 3 to 9 months: Large Decrease, Small Decrease, and Increase. Using concurrent electrocardiograph recordings, attention was measured through the percentage of looking time in orienting, sustained attention, and attention termination. We partially replicated previous findings regarding developmental patterns of attention in these three groups, notably that these patterns were different for the Increase group. Looks away from the stimulus were also assessed in each attentional phase and, as predicted, HR acceleration phases showed less visual engagement than HR deceleration phases. We also found anomalous behavior for the LL Increase group. In general, this small but distinct group showed similarities at 3 months to the presumably more mature behavior of typical 9 month olds, but by 9 months, they behaved more like typical 3 month olds regarding some, but not all, cognitive measures. These results are discussed in the context of the development of endogenous attention.

It has been proposed that infants point to an event to share their appreciation of it with others. In this study, we tested another hypothesis, according to which infants' pointing could also serve as an epistemic request directed to the adult. Thus, infants' motivation for pointing could include the expectation that adults would provide new information about the referent. In two experiments, an adult reacted to 12-month-olds' pointing gestures by exhibiting "Informing" or "Sharing" behavior. In response, infants pointed more frequently across trials in the Informing than in the Sharing condition. This suggests that the feedback that contained new information matched infants' expectations more than mere attention sharing. Such a result is consistent with the idea that not just the comprehension but also the production of early communicative signals is tuned to assist infants' learning from others.					; Csibra, Gergely/C-4345-2008	Gergely, Gyorgy/0000-0002-2094-4258; Csibra, Gergely/0000-0002-7044-3056; Teglas, Erno/0000-0003-4502-3639; Kovacs, Agnes Melinda/0000-0003-3452-7727													1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV-DEC	2014	19	6					543	557		10.1111/infa.12060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12060								26568703					WOS:000342903900002

Maternal vocal responsiveness and infant vocal and smiling responsiveness significantly increased when infants were 2 months of age. Mothers showed continuity of individual differences in vocal responsiveness from the infants' newborn period. Maternal responsiveness predicted infant responsiveness within and across sessions. Compared with infants with low-responsive mothers, infants with high-responsive mothers were more attentive and affectively engaged during the Still-Face Task from 1 month of age. Infants with high-responsive mothers discriminated between the task phases with their smiling at 1 month, a month before infants with low-responsive mothers did so. Infants in both groups discriminated between the phases with their attention and nondistress vocalizations throughout their first 3 months. Results suggest that maternal responsiveness influences infant responsiveness and facilitates infants' engagement and expectations for social interaction.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV-DEC	2014	19	6					558	584		10.1111/infa.12059	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12059													WOS:000342903900003

Eighteen-and 24-month-olds (N = 70) were presented with an experimenter who demonstrated the use of several objects accompanied by either nonverbal expressions of confidence or lack of confidence. At 24 months, infants were more likely to imitate the actions when demonstrated by a confident experimenter than by an unconfident experimenter; 18-month-olds showed no such preference. The experimenter then presented an additional imitation trial and a word-learning trial while displaying a neutral expression. Twenty-four-month-olds persisted in preferentially imitating a previously confident experimenter, but prior confidence had no effect on their word learning. These findings demonstrate a developmental increase in infants' use of confidence cues toward the end of the second year of life.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				SEP-OCT	2014	19	5					461	475		10.1111/infa.12056	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12056													WOS:000342903800002

Learning Stimulus-Location Associations in 8-and 11-Month-Old Infants: Multimodal Versus Unimodal Information	INFANCY												Research on the influence of multimodal information on infants' learning is inconclusive. While one line of research finds that multimodal input has a negative effect on learning, another finds positive effects. The present study aims to shed some new light on this discussion by studying the influence of multimodal information and accompanying stimulus complexity on the learning process. We assessed the influence of multimodal input on the trial-by-trial learning of 8- and 11-month-old infants. Using an anticipatory eye movement paradigm, we measured how infants learn to anticipate the correct stimulus-location associations when exposed to visual-only, auditory-only (unimodal), or auditory and visual (multimodal) information. Our results show that infants in both the multimodal and visual-only conditions learned the stimulus-location associations. Although infants in the visual-only condition appeared to learn in fewer trials, infants in the multimodal condition showed better anticipating behavior: as a group, they had a higher chance of anticipating correctly on more consecutive trials than infants in the visual-only condition. These findings suggest that effects of multimodal information on infant learning operate chiefly through effects on infants' attention.

J	Needham, A; Joh, AS; Wiesen, SE; Williams, N				Needham, Amy; Joh, Amy S.; Wiesen, Sarah E.; Williams, Nicole			Effects of Contingent Reinforcement of Actions on Infants' Object-Directed Reaching	INFANCY												The role of contingency learning was examined in 3-month-old infants' reaching movements. Infants in the experimental group experienced 9 min of active training during which they could move their arms in a reach-like fashion to pull and move a mobile. Infants in the control group experienced 9 min of passive training during which they watched a mobile move. Prior to (pre-training) and following the mobile experience (post-training), infants in both conditions were given an opportunity to interact with a rattle placed within and out of their reach. Compared with infants in the control condition, infants in the experimental condition produced reach-like movements more frequently during the mobile experience; they also showed a greater increase in reaching attempts from pre- to post-training assessments with the rattle. These findings show that reinforcement of arm extensions and retractions increases the frequency of infants' reaching behaviors. This result suggests that the reinforcement of components of infants' behaviors may contribute to the successful assembly of these behaviors. This process could help keep infants engaged during the lengthy transition from prereaching to independent reaching.

Relatively little attention has been paid, however, to methodological issues associated with infant eye-tracking. Here, we consider the possibility that systematic differences in the quality of raw eye-tracking data obtained from different populations and individuals might create the impression of differences in gaze behavior, without this actually being the case. First, we show that lower quality eye-tracking data are obtained from populations who are younger and populations who are more fidgety and that data quality declines during the testing session. Second, we assess how these differences in data quality might influence key dependent variables in eye-tracking analyses. We show that lower precision data can appear to suggest a reduced likelihood to look at the eyes in a face relative to the mouth. We also show that less robust tracking may manifest as slower reaction time latencies (e.g., time to first fixation). Finally, we show that less robust data can manifest as shorter first look/visit duration. We argue that data quality should be reported in all analyses of infant eye-tracking data and/or that steps should be taken to control for data quality before performing final analyses.

Individual Differences in Infant Oculomotor Behavior During the Viewing of Complex Naturalistic Scenes	INFANCY												Little research hitherto has examined how individual differences in attention, as assessed using standard experimental paradigms, relate to individual differences in how attention is spontaneously allocated in more naturalistic contexts. Here, we analyzed the time intervals between refoveating eye movements (fixation durations) while typically developing 11-month-old infants viewed a 90-min battery ranging from complex dynamic to noncomplex static materials. The same infants also completed experimental assessments of cognitive control, psychomotor reaction times (RT), processing speed (indexed via peak look during habituation), and arousal (indexed via tonic pupil size). High test-retest reliability was found for fixation duration, across testing sessions and across types of viewing material. Increased cognitive control and increased arousal were associated with reduced variability in fixation duration. For fixations to dynamic stimuli, in which a large proportion of saccades may be exogenously cued, we found that psychomotor RT measures were most predictive of mean fixation duration; for fixations to static stimuli, in contrast, in which there is less exogenous attentional capture, we found that psychomotor RT did not predict performance, but that measures of cognitive control and arousal did. The implications of these findings for understanding the development of attentional control in naturalistic settings are discussed.

Maternal Responsiveness and the Development of Directed Vocalizing in Social Interactions	INFANCY												For effective communication, infants must develop the phonology of sounds and the ability to use vocalizations in social interactions. Few studies have examined the development of the pragmatic use of prelinguistic vocalizations, possibly because gestures are considered hallmarks of early pragmatic skill. The current study investigated infant vocal production and maternal responsiveness to examine the relationship between infant and maternal behavior in the development of infants' vocal communication. Specifically, we asked whether maternal responses to vocalizations could influence the development of prelinguistic vocal usage, as has been documented in recent experimental studies exploring the relation between maternal responses and phonological development. Twelve mother-infant dyads participated over a six-month period (between 8 and 14months of age). Mothers completed the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory when infants were 15months old. Maternal sensitive responses to infant vocalizations in the previous months predicted infants' mother-directed vocalizations in the following months, rather than overall response rate. Furthermore, mothers' sensitive responding to mother-directed vocalizations was correlated with an increase in developmentally advanced, consonant-vowel vocalizations and some language measures. This is the first study to document a social shaping mechanism influencing developmental change in pragmatic usage of vocalizations in addition to identifying the specific behaviors underlying development.

Hierarchical Processing in Seven-Month-Old Infants	INFANCY												Hierarchical structures are crucial to many aspects of cognitive processing and especially for language. However, there still is little experimental support for the ability of infants to learn such structures. Here, we show that, with structures simple enough to be processed by various animals, seven-month-old infants seem to learn hierarchical relations. Infants were presented with an artificial language composed of sentences made of three-syllable words. The syllables within words conformed to repetition patterns based on syllable tokens involving either adjacent repetitions (e.g., dubaba) or nonadjacent repetitions (e.g., dubadu). Importantly, the sequence of word structures in each sentence conformed to repetition patterns based on word types (e.g., aba-abb-abb). Infants learned this repetition pattern of repetition patterns and thus likely a hierarchical pattern based on repetitions, but only when the repeated word structure was based on adjacent repetitions. While our results leave open the question of which exact sentence-level pattern infants learned, they suggest that infants embedded the word-level patterns into a higher-level pattern and thus seemed to acquire a hierarchically embedded pattern.

Time-series analyses were used to study the temporal nature of looking displayed by 3- to 5-month-old infants during a serial paired-comparison task. Evidence was found only for short-term stability: Novelty preferences and side biases were not stable from one visit to the next, but looking was consistent from one moment to the next producing stability within trials and temporarily across trials leading to the formation of behavioral runs. Persistence in looking left or right across multiple trials did not change from one visit to the next, but persistence in looking at familiar stimuli declined with age. By Visit 3, familiarity runs occurred less often than did novelty runs. Frequent but highly variable runs, including surprisingly late familiarity preferences, suggest that overall side biases and novelty preferences found during visual preference tasks are emergent phenomena affected by moment-to-moment changes in looking.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAY	2014	19	3					227	261		10.1111/infa.12051	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12051													WOS:000334442200001

Developmentally, research has shown that children do not show sensitivity to these natural regularities until approximately 8-10years of age. This finding is surprising given that even infants gradually encode a range of high-level statistical regularities of their visual environment in the first year of life, We suggest that infants may in fact exhibit sensitivity to natural image statistics under circumstances where images of complex, natural textures, such as a photograph of rocks, are used as experimental stimuli and natural appearance is substantially manipulated. We tested this hypothesis by examining how infants' visual preference for real versus computer-generated synthetic textures was modulated by contrast negation, which produces an image similar to a photographic negative. We observed that older infants' (9-months of age) preferential looking behavior in this task was affected by contrast polarity, suggesting that the infant visual system is sensitive to deviations from natural texture appearance, including (1) discrepancies in appearance that differentiate natural and synthetic textures from one another and (2) the disruption of contrast polarity following negation. We discuss our results in the context of adult texture processing and the "perceptual narrowing" of visual recognition during the first year of life.

Productive Verbs Facilitate Action Prediction in Toddlers	INFANCY												Children can represent events in our everyday life in both non-linguistic and linguistic formats. We aimed to investigate whether non-linguistic representations are changed once children acquire their linguistic counterparts. In the present study, we explored whether and how language changes the perception of simple means-end actions using an eye-tracking paradigm. Children between 12 and 24months of age heard a sentence containing a verb and subsequently watched an action video. Results show an interfering influence of language on action perception at 12months and a facilitating influence at 24months. However, this was only the case for verbs that are already in the toddlers' productive vocabulary but not for those that are acquired later. Taken together, the results suggest that a communication between non-linguistic and linguistic representations starts early and develops in the second year of life. The successful facilitatory influence depends on the productive repertoire of the language in question.

Although it has been found that adults exhibit approach-style neural activity during jealousy paradigms (Harmon-Jones, Peterson, and Harris, ), parallel research on neural activity during a jealousy paradigm in infants is lacking from the literature base. The purpose of the current research is to examine EEG patterns of 35 infants (Mean age=8.92months old) in a social-rival paradigm designed to elicit jealousy responses. Consistent with past research, infants demonstrated more approach-style, jealousy-related behaviors when their mothers attended to a social-rival than to a nonsocial rival. Additionally, infants demonstrated approach-style anterior EEG activity during the social-rival condition, a pattern that is associated with jealousy. The current findings suggest that the physiological underpinnings for the emotions that motivate the protection of important dyadic relationships are in place early in ontogeny. Therefore, jealousy-type behaviors and physiological responses begin to be observable as early as 9-months-old when maternal attention is lost to a social-rival.

In the current paper, we demonstrate that infants' ability to learn words containing unfamiliar language sounds is influenced by the age and vocabulary size of the infant learner, as well as by cues to the speaker's referential intent. When referential cues were available, infants at 14months learned words with non-native speech sounds, but at 20months only those infants with smaller vocabularies succeeded. When no referential cues were present, infants at both 14 and 20months failed to learn the same words. The implications of the relation between linguistic sophistication and non-native word learning are discussed.

However, it is unclear whether young bilingual infants exposed to rhythmically similar languages develop sensitivities to cross-linguistic rhythm cues to discriminate their dual language input. To address this question, 3.5-month-old monolingual Basque, monolingual Spanish and bilingual Basque-Spanish infants' language discrimination abilities (across low-pass filtered speech samples of Basque and Spanish) have been tested using the visual habituation procedure. Although falling within the same rhythmic class, Basque and Spanish exhibit significant differences in their distributions of vocalic intervals (within-rhythmic class variation). All infant groups in our study successfully discriminated between the languages, although each group exhibited a different pattern. Monolingual Spanish infants succeeded only when they heard Basque during habituation, suggesting that they were influenced by native language recognition. The bilingual and the Basque monolingual infants showed no such asymmetries and succeeded irrespective of the language of habituation. Additionally, bilingual infants exhibited longer looking times in the test phase as compared with monolinguals, reflecting that bilingual infants attend to their native languages differently than monolinguals. Overall, results suggest that bilingual infants are sensitive to within-rhythm acoustic regularities of their native language(s) facilitating language discrimination and hence supporting early bilingual acquisition.

Postural Position Constrains Multimodal Object Exploration in Infants	INFANCY												Recent research has revealed the important role of multimodal object exploration in infants' cognitive and social development. Yet, the real-time effects of postural position on infants' object exploration have been largely ignored. In the current study, 5- to 7-month-old infants (N=29) handled objects while placed in supported sitting, supine, and prone postures, and their spontaneous exploratory behaviors were observed. Infants produced more manual, oral, and visual exploration in sitting compared to lying supine and prone. Moreover, while sitting, infants more often coupled manual exploration with mouthing and visual examination. Infants' opportunities for learning from object exploration are embedded within a real-time postural context that constrains the quantity and quality of exploratory behavior.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAR	2014	19	2					138	161		10.1111/infa.12039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12039								24639621					WOS:000329924700002

INFANCY												The ability to distinguish phonetic variations in speech that are relevant to meaning is essential for infants' language development. Previous studies into the acquisition of prosodic categories have focused on lexical stress, lexical pitch accent, or lexical tone. However, very little is known about the developmental course of infants' perception of linguistic intonation. In this study, we investigate infants' perception of the correlates of the statement/yes-no question contrast in a language that marks this sentence type distinction only by prosodic means, European Portuguese (EP). Using a modified version of the visual habituation paradigm, EP-learning infants at 5-6 and 8-9months were able to successfully discriminate segmentally varied, single-prosodic word intonational phrases presented with statement or yes-no question intonation, demonstrating that they are sensitive to the prosodic cues marking this distinction as early as 5months and maintain this sensitivity throughout the first year. These results suggest the presence of precocious discrimination abilities for intonation across segmental variation, similarly to previous reports for lexical pitch accent, but unlike previous findings for word stress.

What Cruising Infants Understand about Support for Locomotion	INFANCY												Cruising infants can only walk using external support to augment their balance. We examined cruisers' understanding of support for upright locomotion under four conditions: cruising over a wooden handrail at chest height, a large gap in the handrail, a wobbly unstable handrail, and an ill-positioned low handrail. Infants distinguished among the support properties of the handrails with differential attempts to cruise and handrail-specific forms of haptic exploration and gait modifications. They consistently attempted the wood handrail, rarely attempted the gap, and occasionally attempted the low and wobbly handrails. On the wood and gap handrails, attempt rates matched the probability of cruising successfully, but on the low and wobbly handrails, attempt rates under- and overestimated the probability of success, respectively. Haptic exploration was most frequent and varied on the wobbly handrail, and gait modificationsincluding previously undocumented knee cruisingwere most frequent and effective on the low handrail. Results are discussed in terms of developmental changes in the meaning of support.

J	Casler, K				Casler, Krista			New Tool, New Function? Toddlers' Use of Mutual Exclusivity When Mapping Information to Objects	INFANCY												Prior research has suggested that 24-month-old toddlers will rapidly map the function of a novel object but that, unlike preschoolers and adults, they will use the tool for other purposes as well. Here, this nonexclusive pattern of object use was explored. Because it has been unclear whether a mature one tool, one function bias in assigning object functions is rooted in deployment of general learning principles or artifact-specific thinking, Study 1 explored 24-month-olds' exploitation of social-pragmatic cues when mapping labels, facts, and functions to novel objects. Results demonstrated that toddlers readily used a principle of mutual exclusivity to constrain assignments of labels and facts but not functions. This performance was corroborated in Study 2. It appears that 24-month-olds have a developing understanding that artifacts have specialized functions but that mutual exclusivity does not guide this development.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAR	2014	19	2					162	178		10.1111/infa.12044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12044													WOS:000329924700003
J	Junge, C; Cutler, A; Hagoort, P				Junge, Caroline; Cutler, Anne; Hagoort, Peter			Successful Word Recognition by 10-Month-Olds Given Continuous Speech Both at Initial Exposure and Test	INFANCY												Most words that infants hear occur within fluent speech. To compile a vocabulary, infants therefore need to segment words from speech contexts. This study is the first to investigate whether infants (here: 10-month-olds) can recognize words when both initial exposure and test presentation are in continuous speech. Electrophysiological evidence attests that this indeed occurs: An increased extended negativity (word recognition effect) appears for familiarized target words relative to control words. This response proved constant at the individual level: Only infants who showed this negativity at test had shown such a response, within six repetitions after first occurrence, during familiarization.

Origins of Individual Differences in Prosocial Behavior	INFANCY												This study investigated the influence of emotion on toddlers' prosocial behavior in instrumental helping tasks with an unfamiliar adult. The goals were to examine whether early prosocial behavior was affected by (1) the adult's expressions of sadness (in contrast to a neutral expression) as a cue of need and (2) toddlers' emotion understanding. Thirty-five 18- to 20-month-olds participated in eight trials in which an experimenter either indicated need for assistance (experimental condition) or did not (control). In addition, the experimenter expressed either sadness or neutral affect in each trial. Toddlers' emotion understanding was assessed using maternal reports of children's emotion words. The experimenter's emotional expression alone was not associated with prosocial behavior, but toddlers helped more in experimental than control conditions. However, toddlers with larger emotion word vocabularies were marginally more prosocial when the experimenter expressed sadness, and girls provided more assistance than boys in experimental conditions. These findings highlight the complex influences of emotion on early prosocial motivation.

J	Aslin, RN				Aslin, Richard N.			Infant Learning: Historical, Conceptual, and Methodological Challenges	INFANCY												Acquiring knowledge about the underlying structures of the environment presents a number of challenges for a naive learner. These challenges include the absence of reinforcement to guide learning, the presence of numerous information sources from which only a select few are relevant, and the uncertainty about when an underlying structure may have undergone a change. A crucial implication of these challenges is that the naive learner must make implicit decisions about when to generalize to novel inputs and when to restrict generalization because there are multiple underlying structures. An historical perspective on these challenges is presented, and some potential solutions are proposed.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				JAN	2014	19	1					2	27		10.1111/infa.12036	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12036								26568702					WOS:000328403400002

Behavioral and Electrophysiological Indices of Memory in Typically Developing and Hypoxic-Ischemic Injured Infants	INFANCY												Behavioral and electrophysiological indices of memory were examined in 12-month-old typically developing control infants (CON) and infants with history of perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury (HII) across 2days. Using a visual paired comparison (VPC) procedure, novelty preference was tested immediately after a familiarization period and then after delays of 2min and 24h. Both groups showed a significant novelty preference only for the no-delay condition. On day two, event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while infants viewed the VPC familiar face, a more recently familiarized face, and a novel face, and mean amplitude for components thought to reflect memory (positive slow wave, PSW) and attention (negative central, Nc) were computed. In temporal regions, HII showed a diminished Nc and enhanced PSW to the recently familiarized face, while CON showed a similar trend for the PSW only. Overall, infants showed the largest PSW over left scalp regions. Finally, a positive correlation between VPC novelty preference after 24h and PSW was found in CON, and preliminary results suggest that this association differs as a function of group. Therefore, in comparison with CON, HII showed both similarities and differences on individual tasks of memory as well as potentially disparate relations between the behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying memory performance.					nelson, charles/LBH-6397-2024	Wagner, Jennifer/0000-0001-8174-0534; Nelson, Charles/0000-0002-4723-247X													1525-0008	1532-7078				JAN	2014	19	1					28	52		10.1111/infa.12032	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12032													WOS:000328403400003

Object Locations, Identity and Absent Reference Understanding at 12 Months	INFANCY												Spatial and contextual information plays an organizing role in many cognitive processes including object individuation and memory retrieval. Recently, attention has been drawn to the fact that changes in an object's location negatively affect infants' learning in different domains. One example is that prestudy exposure to a target object in a nontest location disrupts infants' ability to locate that object when it is hidden in a test room. In the current study, we investigate the possibility that infants' difficulty finding the object is the result of confusion about the identity of the target object. In the current research, infants were familiarized with an object in one room and tested in the other. Infants who were shown a characteristic identifying feature on the object in both locations and who were thus able to track the object identity could later locate the absent referent. In contrast, when infants' attention was drawn to different features on the object in the two locations or to the object itself via pointing, infants were unable to find the object.

Until now, however, it has been unclear whether it was the onset of walking per se that influenced reaching patterns or whether a more general shift to an upright posture might have prompted the reorganization of the motor system. To address this question, the current study longitudinally chronicled the uni- and bimanual reaching preferences of 25 infants every 3weeks starting at 7months, prior to the onset of pulling-to-stand and through the onset of cruising. Experimenters recorded infants' reaching behavior via a semi-structured reaching procedure and documented their motor development. There was no relationship between the shift from uni- to bimanual reaching and the onset of pulling-to-stand. However, the onset of cruising was related to a shift in reaching pattern preference, suggesting that the increase in infants' bimanual reaching was prompted by a reorganization of the motor system in which the arms are recruited for use in new ways to support locomotion. We also discuss individual differences in the trajectory of reaching activity in terms of the pitfalls of using age as an explanatory variable.

Infants' responses to the previously attended and unattended objects were measured using eye-tracking and event-related potentials. In both conditions, infants responded to objects that were not cued by the adult's head or eye gaze shift with more visual attention and an increased negative central (Nc) component relative to cued objects. This suggests that cued objects had been encoded more effectively, whereas uncued objects required further processing. We conclude that eye gaze and head orientation act independently as cues to direct infants' attention and object processing. Both head orientation and eye gaze, when presented in motion, even override the effects of incongruent stationary information from the other kind of cue.

A Sex Difference in Mental Rotation in Infants: Convergent Evidence	INFANCY												Quinn and Liben (2008) reported a sex difference on a mental rotation task in which 3- to 4-month-olds were familiarized with a shape in different rotations and then tested with a novel rotation of the familiar shape and its mirror image. As a group, males but not females showed a significant preference for the mirror image, a pattern paralleled at the individual level (with most males but less than half the females showing the preference). Experiment 1 examined a possible explanation for this performance difference, namely, that females were more sensitive to the angular differences in the familiarized shape. Three- to 4-month-olds were given a discrimination task involving familiarization with a shape at a given rotation and preference testing with the shape in the familiarized versus a novel rotation. Females and males preferred the novel rotation, with no sex difference observed. This finding did not provide support for the suggestion that the sex difference in mental rotation is explained by differential sensitivity to angular rotation. Experiment 2 revealed that the sex difference in mental rotation is observed in 6- to 7-month-olds and 9- to 10-month-olds, suggesting that a sex difference in mental rotation is present at multiple ages during infancy.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				JAN	2014	19	1					103	116		10.1111/infa.12033	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12033													WOS:000328403400007

The present study investigates 24-month-olds' word recognition in sentence-medial position in two experiments using an Intermodal Preferential Looking paradigm. In Experiment 1, French toddlers detect word-final voicing mispronunciations (e.g., buz [byz] for bus [bys] bus), and they compensate for native voicing assimilations (e.g., buz devant toi [buzd?v?twa] bus in front of you) in the middle of sentences. Similarly, English toddlers detect word-final voicing mispronunciations (e.g., sheeb for sheep) in Experiment 2, but they do not compensate for illicit voicing assimilations (e.g., sheeb there). Thus, French and English 24-month-olds can take into account fine phonetic detail even if words are presented in the middle of sentences, and French toddlers show language-specific compensation abilities for pronunciation variation caused by native voicing assimilation.

Integrating these two lines of research, the current study asks how specific the phonological match between a perceived word and its stored form has to be in order to lead to (cascaded) lexical activation of related words during infant lexical processing. We presented German 24-month-olds with a cross-modal semantic priming task where the prime word was either correctly or incorrectly pronounced. Results indicate that correct pronunciations and mispronunciations both elicit similar semantic priming effects, suggesting that the infant word recognition system is flexible enough to handle deviations from the correct form. This might be an important prerequisite to children's ability to cope with imperfect input and to recognize words under more challenging circumstances.					; Mani, Nivedita/F-8795-2010	Altvater-Mackensen, Nicole/0000-0002-8075-4720; Mani, Nivedita/0000-0002-9843-4629													1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV	2013	18	6					1030	1052		10.1111/infa.12022	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12022													WOS:000325269700007

Toddlers Activate Lexical Semantic Knowledge in the Absence of Visual Referents: Evidence from Auditory Priming	INFANCY												Language learners rapidly acquire extensive semantic knowledge, but the development of this knowledge is difficult to study, in part because it is difficult to assess young children's lexical semantic representations. In our studies, we solved this problem by investigating lexical semantic knowledge in 24-month-olds using the Head-turn Preference Procedure. In Experiment 1, looking times to a repeating spoken word stimulus (e.g., kitty-kitty-kitty) were shorter for trials preceded by a semantically related word (e.g., dog-dog-dog) than trials preceded by an unrelated word (e.g., juice-juice-juice). Experiment 2 yielded similar results using a method in which pairs of words were presented on the same trial. The studies provide evidence that young children activate of lexical semantic knowledge, and critically, that they do so in the absence of visual referents or sentence contexts. Auditory lexical priming is a promising technique for studying the development and structure of semantic knowledge in young children.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV	2013	18	6					1053	1075		10.1111/infa.12026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12026								24409090					WOS:000325269700008

Regulation of Jealousy Protest in the Context of Reunion Following Differential Treatment	INFANCY												Emotion regulation strategies and variation in their presentation were explored toward understanding infants' responses during reunion with mother (Re) following baseline mother-infant interaction (Bl) and differential treatment (DT) episodes. Correlation analyses revealed cohesion among distress and mother-directed touch and proximity-seeking during DT and Re, mother-directed gaze during DT, and resistance during Re. The association between mother-directed gaze during DT and distress during Re suggests that visual inattention during DT serves as a regulatory strategy. Overall, these linkages yield expanded understanding of jealousy protest as a constellation of responses that endures beyond the eliciting condition and includes regulatory behaviors. Cross-context comparisons revealed that distress was lower during Re than during DT, but not as low as Bl, suggesting that DT poses challenge to interactive repair. Inquiry into individual variation revealed that distress during Re was augmented in laterborn males and with risk influences of dysregulated fear, and maternal insensitivity and hostility. Conversely, maternal depression was associated with less distress; later judgment as insecure, especially insecure-avoidance, was associated with less mother-directed behaviors. These findings suggest that dysregulation following DT is indicated by both resistance and passivity. In sum, the results highlight emotion regulation as a powerful framework for addressing recovery following DT.

Mothers and infants were recruited via the National Health Service from the 20% most economically impoverished data zones in a suburban region of Scotland. Mothers (N=63; M age=25.9) and their 4-month-old infants (35 boys, 28 girls) were videotaped interacting for 8min, including a still-face procedure as a stress inducer and a 5-min coded recovery period. Saliva samples were collected from the dyads prior to, during, and after the still-face procedure and later assayed for cortisol. Level of disruption in maternal communication with the infant was coded from the 5-min videotaped interaction during the recovery period which followed the still-face procedure. Severely disrupted maternal communication was associated with lower levels of maternal cortisol and a greater divergence between mothers' and infants' cortisol levels. Results point to low maternal cortisol as a possible mechanism contributing to the mother's difficulty in sensitively attuning to her infant's cues, which in turn has implications for the infant's reactivity to and recovery from a mild stressor in early infancy.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV	2013	18	6					1111	1134		10.1111/infa.12015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12015								25506272					WOS:000325269700010

We observed no mean differences between boys and girls in frequency or duration of nondistressed vocalizations at any one time period. However, while these parameters were essentially static for boys, girls showed a quadratic developmental curve, declining in frequency and duration between 6 and 8months and climbing above their early starting point by 9-11months. Mothers of boys showed a linear decrease in the duration of their speech over the 9months of our study. In contrast, mothers of girls showed quadratic patterns of ultimately increasing vocalization frequency and duration, over the months 3-11 of development. Finally, boys' and girls' vocalization contingent to maternal speech revealed no differences. Mothers of boys, however, did not change significantly over time, while mothers of girls showed an increase in contingent responsiveness from 3-5months to 9-11months and from 6-8months to 9-11months. A similar pattern was followed for object-related maternal vocal responses.

The Emergence and Stability of the Attentional Bias to Fearful Faces in Infancy	INFANCY												Several studies have shown that at 7months of age, infants display an attentional bias toward fearful facial expressions. In this study, we analyzed visual attention and heart rate data from a cross-sectional study with 5-, 7-, 9-, and 11-month-old infants (Experiment 1) and visual attention from a longitudinal study with 5- and 7-month-old infants (Experiment 2) to examine the emergence and stability of the attentional bias to fearful facial expressions. In both experiments, the attentional bias to fearful faces appeared to emerge between 5 and 7months of age: 5-month-olds did not show a difference in disengaging attention from fearful and nonfearful faces, whereas 7- and 9-month-old infants had a lower probability of disengaging attention from fearful than nonfearful faces. Across the age groups, heart rate (HR) data (Experiment 1) showed a more pronounced and longer-lasting HR deceleration to fearful than nonfearful expressions. The results are discussed in relation to the development of the perception and experience of fear and the interaction between emotional and attentional processes.

Infants Show Ratio-dependent Number Discrimination Regardless of Set Size	INFANCY												Evidence for approximate number system (ANS) representations in infancy is robust but has typically only been found when infants are presented with arrays of four or more elements. In addition, several studies have found that infants fail to discriminate between small numbers when continuous variables such as surface area and contour length are controlled. These findings suggest that under some circumstances, infants fail to recruit either the ANS or object file representations for small sets. Here, we used a numerical change detection paradigm to assess 6-month-old infants' ability to represent small values. In Experiment 1, infants were tested with 1 versus 3, 1 versus 2, and 2 versus 3 dots. Infants successfully discriminated 1 versus 3 and 1 versus 2, but failed with 2 versus 3. In Experiment 2, we tested whether infants could compare small and large values with a 2 versus 4 condition. Across both experiments, infants' performance exhibited ratio dependence, the hallmark of the ANS. Our results indicate that infants can attend to the purely numerical attributes of small sets and that the numerical change detection paradigm accesses ANS representations in infancy regardless of set size.

Infant Brain Responses to Object Weight: Exploring Goal-Directed Actions and Self-Experience	INFANCY												Recent work has suggested the value of electroencephalographic (EEG) measures in the study of infants' processing of human action. Studies in this area have investigated desynchronization of the sensorimotor mu rhythm during action execution and action observation in infancy. Untested but critical to theory is whether the mu rhythm shows a differential response to actions which share similar goals but have different motor requirements or sensory outcomes. By varying the invisible property of object weight, we controlled for the abstract goal (reach, grasp, and lift the object), while allowing other aspects of the action to vary. The mu response during 14-month-old infants' own executed actions showed a differential hemispheric response between acting on heavier and lighter objects. EEG responses also showed sensitivity to expected object weight when infants simply observed an experimenter reach for objects that the infants' prior experience indicated were heavier vs. lighter. Crucially, this neural reactivity was predictiveduring the observation of the other reaching toward the object, before lifting occurred. This suggests that infants' own self-experience with a particular object's weight influences their processing of others' actions on the object, with implications for developmental social-cognitive neuroscience.

Expectations About Single Event Probabilities in the First Year of Life: The Influence of Perceptual and Statistical Information	INFANCY												Recent evidence suggests that infants can generate expectations about future events from a sample of probabilistic data. However, little is known about the conditions that support the development of this ability. Three experiments tested the prediction that 8- and 12-month-olds respond to base rates as well as perceptual cues when they generate expectations from a sample of probabilistic data. Results revealed that 12-month-olds were sensitive to the statistical and perceptual properties of the evidence depending on the distribution of high-to-low base rate items in the sample. Specifically, 12-month-olds focused on perceptual features of the evidence when a sample was large and more skewed (e.g., 6:1), whereas they attended to statistical properties when the sample was smaller and less skewed (e.g., 4:1). In contrast, eight-month-olds always focused on the perceptual features of the evidence. Neither group generated expectations from a small, less skewed sample (e.g., 2:1). These results suggest that the ability to generate expectations about future events is mediated by specific features of the available evidence and undergoes significant change during the first year of life.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				NOV	2013	18	6					961	982		10.1111/infa.12014	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12014								24285932					WOS:000325269700004

Investigating the Relation Between Infants' Manual Activity With Objects and Their Perception of Dynamic Events	INFANCY												We examined the relation between 6- and 7-month-old infants' (N=60) manual activity with objects during free play and their perception of the features of dynamic, multimodal events. Infants were habituated to a single event in which a hand reached for and manipulated a colorful, multifeatured object, and a sound was heard (e.g., a hand squeezed a purple round object, causing a whistling sound) and then their response to events that involved a change in the appearance of the object, the action, or the sound was assessed. Infants responded least to changes in the appearance of the objects, and their sensitivity to this feature was related to their manual activity with objects during free play. Infants' responding to changes in the sound or action was unrelated to motor activity, suggesting that at this age motor achievements related to object exploration are associated with infants' perception of some, but not all, object features.

Infants' Transitions out of a Fussing/Crying State Are Modifiable and Are Related to Weight Status	INFANCY												Currently, about 10% of infants have a weight for length greater than the 95th percentile for their age and sex, which puts them at risk for obesity as they grow. In a pilot obesity prevention study, primiparous mothers and their newborn infants were randomly assigned to a control group or a Soothe/Sleep intervention. Previously, it has been demonstrated that this intervention contributed to lower weight-for-length percentiles at 1year; the aim of the present study was to examine infant behavior diary data collected during the intervention. Markov modeling was used to characterize infants' patterns of behavioral transitions at ages 3 and 16weeks. Results showed that heavier mothers were more likely to follow their infants' fussing/crying episodes with a feeding. The intervention increased infants' likelihood of transitioning from a fussing/crying state to an awake/calm state. A shorter latency to feed in response to fussing/crying was associated with a higher subsequent weight status. This study provides preliminary evidence that infants' transitions out of fussing/crying are characterized by inter-individual differences, are modifiable, and are linked to weight outcomes, suggesting that they may be promising targets for early behavioral obesity interventions, and highlighting the methodology used in this study as an appropriate and innovative tool to assess the impact of such interventions.

The Development of Referential Communication and Autism Symptomatology in High-Risk Infants	INFANCY												Non-verbal referential communication is impaired in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the development of difficulties with referential communication in the younger siblings of children with ASD (High-Risk Siblings)and the degree to which early referential communication predicts later autism symptomatologyis not clear. We modeled the early developmental trajectories of three types of referential communication: responding to joint attention (RJA), initiating joint attention (IJA), and initiating behavioral requests (IBR) across 8, 10, 12, 15, and 18months of age in High-Risk Siblings (n=40) and the infant siblings of children without ASD (Low-Risk Siblings; n=21). Hierarchical linear modeling indicated that High-Risk Siblings exhibited lower levels of baseline RJA and IJA and a lower rate of linear change in IBR than Low-Risk Siblings. When the 10 High-Risk Siblings who received an ASD diagnosis were excluded from analyses, group differences in the development of referential communication remained significant only for RJA. Baseline levels of IJA were associated with later ASD symptomatology among High-Risk Siblings, suggesting that individual differences in referential communication development at 8months may index early manifestations of ASD.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				SEP	2013	18	5					687	707		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00142.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00142.x								24403864					WOS:000323167800003

Caregiver Protective Behavior, Toddler Fear and Sadness, and Toddler Cortisol Reactivity in Novel Contexts	INFANCY												Previous research has shown that caregiver protective behavior may exacerbate toddler distress in specific contexts. This study sought to extend this work to examine associations between these variables and toddler cortisol reactivity. Ninety-three 24-month-old toddlers were observed across six novel contexts designed to elicit distress. Toddlers were asked to give saliva samples at the beginning and end of the laboratory procedure. Toddler sadness, toddler fear and caregiver protective behavior were coded. Results indicate that caregiver protective behavior accounted for the association between toddler sadness and cortisol reactivity where higher levels of protective behavior were associated with higher cortisol reactivity. This study showed that caregiver protective behavior, which functions to prevent a child from interacting with a novel stimulus, is an important mechanism to consider when understanding toddler stress responses during novel contexts.

Developmental Trajectories of Emotion Regulation Across Infancy: Do Age and the Social Partner Influence Temporal Patterns	INFANCY												The ability to effectively regulate emotions is a critical component of early socio-emotional development. This longitudinal study examined the developmental trajectories of emotion regulation in a sample of 3-, 5-, and 7-month-olds during an interaction with mothers and fathers. Infants' negative affect and use of behavioral strategies, including distraction, self-soothing, and high intensity motor behaviors were rated during the still-face episode of the Still-Face Paradigm. Longitudinal mixed-effects models were tested to determine whether strategies were followed by an increase or decrease in negative affect. Results from mother-infant and father-infant dyads indicated that focusing attention away from the unresponsive parent and engaging in self-soothing behaviors were associated with a subsequent decline in negative affect and the strength of these temporal associations were stable across infancy. In contrast, high-intensity motor behaviors were followed by an increase in negative affect and this effect declined over time. No significant effects were found for the behavioral strategy of looking at the parent. Results underscore the importance of considering infant age and the social partner when studying the effectiveness of emotion regulatory strategies in early infancy.

Memory for One-Time Experiences in the Second Year of Life: Implications for the Status of Episodic Memory	INFANCY												Memory based on a one-time experience is an important element of its definition as episodic. Infants' memories for one-time experiences over long delays are largely unexplored. Using elicited imitation, we tested 20- and 16-month-olds' (Experiment 1) and 13-month-olds' (Experiment 2) memories as a function of number of experiences and delay. Over 1month, 20- and 16-month-olds remembered individual actions of one-time events; 20-month-olds also remembered temporal order; with verbal reminders, 16-month-olds did as well. Over 3months, recall depended on multiple experiences. Thirteen-month-olds' required multiple experiences, even over 1month. The findings speak to the gradual emergence of an important element of episodic memory, namely the ability to preserve memories of one-time experiences over long periods of time.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				SEP	2013	18	5					755	781		10.1111/infa.12005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12005													WOS:000323167800006
J	Coulon, M; Hemimou, C; Streri, A				Coulon, Marion; Hemimou, Cherhazad; Streri, Arlette			Effects of Seeing and Hearing Vowels on Neonatal Facial Imitation	INFANCY												For several decades, many authors have claimed the existence, early in life, of a tight link between perceptual and productive systems in speech. However, the question whether this link is acquired or is already present at birth remains open. This study aimed at investigating this question by employing the paradigm of neonatal facial imitation. We compared imitative responses of newborn infants presented either visual-only, audiovisual congruent, or audiovisual incongruent models. Our results revealed that the newborns imitated significantly more quickly the movements of the model's mouth when this model was audiovisual congruent rather than visual-only. Moreover, when observing an audiovisual incongruent model, the newborns did not produce imitative behavior. These findings, by highlighting the influence of speech perception on newborns' imitative responses, suggest that the neural architecture for perception-production is already in place at birth. The implications of these results are discussed in terms of a link between language and neonatal imitation, which could represent a precursor of more mature forms of vocal imitation and speech development in general.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				SEP	2013	18	5					782	796		10.1111/infa.12001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12001													WOS:000323167800007
J	Estes, KG; Hurley, K				Estes, Katharine Graf; Hurley, Karinna			Infant-Directed Prosody Helps Infants Map Sounds to Meanings	INFANCY												Adults typically use an exaggerated, distinctive speaking style when addressing infants. However, the effects of infant-directed (ID) speech on infants' learning are not yet well understood. This research investigates how ID speech affects how infants perform a key function in language acquisition, associating the sounds of words with their meanings. Seventeen-month-old infants were presented with two label-object pairs in a habituation-based word learning task. In Experiment 1, the labels were produced in adult-directed (AD) speech. In Experiment 2, the labels were produced in ID prosody; they had higher pitch, greater pitch variation, and longer durations than the AD labels. We found that infants failed to learn the labels in AD speech, but succeeded in learning the same labels when they were produced in ID speech. Experiment 3 investigated the role of variability in learning from ID speech. When the labels were presented in ID prosody with no variation across tokens, infants failed to learn them. Our findings indicate that ID prosody can affect how readily infants map sounds to meanings and that the variability in prosody that is characteristic of ID speech may play a key role in its effect on learning new words.

Mothers were recorded during a play interaction with their HI infants (N=27, mean age 18.4months) at 3, 6, and 12months postimplantation. Two separate control groups of mothers with age-matched normal-hearing infants (NH-AM) (N=21, mean age 18.1months) and hearing experience-matched normal-hearing infants (NH-EM) (N=24, mean age 3.1months) were recorded at three testing sessions. Mothers produced less exaggerated pitch characteristics, a larger number of syllables per utterance, and faster speaking rate when interacting with NH-AM as compared to HI infants. Mothers also produced more syllables and demonstrated a trend suggesting faster speaking rate in speech to NH-EM relative to HI infants. Age-related modifications included decreased pitch standard deviation and increased number of syllables in speech to NH-AM infants and increased number of syllables in speech to HI and NH-EM infants across the 12-month period. These results suggest that mothers are sensitive to the hearing status of their infants and modify characteristics of infant-directed speech over time.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				SEP	2013	18	5					825	848		10.1111/infa.12010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12010								24244108					WOS:000323167800009

Moment-by-moment analyses on a microlevel were used to study social engagement and vocal interaction. We analysed and categorized 854 vocalization periods (mother-only vocalizations, tonal interaction periods, nontonal interaction periods, and mutual silence). Tonal synchrony was analysed in terms of harmonic and pentatonic series based on pitch frequency analyses. Social engagement was microanalyzed in terms of matched and mismatched engagement states. ANOVA-repeated measures revealed, most importantly, a significant relationship between TIPs and social interaction repair, which indicates the importance of tonal synchrony in the flow of social engagement in mother-infant dyads. Other significant relationships were found between (a) nTIPs/mismatch-mismatch, and, (b) MOV/affect loss. As mentioned in the discussion, the findings are suggestive for clinical applications (e.g., music therapy) and warrant further research.

Posture Development in Infants at Heightened versus Low Risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders	INFANCY												Evidence suggests that children and adults diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) exhibit difficulties with postural control. Retrospective video studies of infants later diagnosed with ASD indicate that infants who eventually receive an ASD diagnosis exhibit delays in postural development. This study investigates early posture development prospectively and longitudinally in 22 infants at heightened biological risk for ASD (HR) and 18 infants with no such risk (Low Risk; LR). Four HR infants received an autism diagnosis (AD infants) at 36months. Infants were videotaped at home at 6, 9, 12, and 14months during everyday activities and play. All infant postures were coded and classified as to whether or not they were infant-initiated. Relative to LR infants, HR infants were slower to develop skill in sitting and standing postures. AD infants exhibited substantial delays in the emergence of more advanced postures and initiated fewer posture changes. Because posture advances create opportunities for infants to interact with objects and people in new and progressively more sophisticated ways, postural delays may have cascading effects on opportunities for infant exploration and learning. These effects may be greater for infants with ASD, for whom posture delays are more significant.

The Effect of Speaker Labeling Accuracy on Infants' Word Learning, Imitation, and Helping Behaviors	INFANCY												This study examined infants' sensitivity to a speaker's verbal accuracy and whether the reliability of the speaker had an effect on their selective trust. Forty-nine 18-month-old infants were exposed to a speaker who either accurately or inaccurately labeled familiar objects. Subsequently, the speaker administered a series of tasks in which infants had an opportunity to: learn a novel word, imitate the speaker's irrational actions, and help the speaker obtain an out-of-reach object. In contrast to infants in the accurate (reliable) condition, those in the inaccurate (unreliable) condition performed more poorly on a word-learning task and were less likely to imitate. All infants demonstrated high rates of instrumental helping behavior. These results are the first to demonstrate that infants as young as 18months of age cannot only detect a speaker's verbal inaccuracy but also use this information to attenuate their word recognition and learning of novel actions.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				AUG	2013	18			1			E46	E68		10.1111/infa.12027	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12027								26807045					WOS:000326032400003

However, it remains unknown if infants can detect whether a person's emotions are justifiable given a particular context. The focus of the current paper was to examine whether infants react the same way to unjustified (e.g., distress following a positive experience) and justified (e.g., distress following a negative experience) emotional reactions. Infants aged 15 and 18months were shown an actor experiencing negative and positive experiences, with one group exposed to an actor whose emotional reactions were consistently unjustified (i.e., did not match the event), while the other saw an actor whose emotional reactions were justified (i.e., always matched the event). Infants' looking times and empathic reactions were examined. Only 18-month-olds detected the mismatching facial expressions: Those in the unjustified group showed more hypothesis testing (i.e., checking) across events than the justified group. Older infants in the justified group also showed more concerned reactions to negative expressions than those in the unjustified group. The present findings indicate that infants implicitly understand how the emotional valence of experiences is linked to subsequent emotional expressions.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				AUG	2013	18			1			E81	E96		10.1111/infa.12028	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12028								25071421					WOS:000326032400005

Previous research reports that although infants laugh in response to tactile stimulation in first 6months of life, they cease laughing to this stimulation as they grow. Because older children often appear to laugh in response to tickling, the current study focused on relationships between infants' response to tickling and social factors as they grow. Specifically, we examined effects of different maternal social interactions on infants' reactions to tickling vs. stroking tactile stimulations. Results showed that a tickle stimulus, together with maternal communications, elicits positive reactions in infants. In contrast, a noncommunicative mother and stroking tends to elicit from the child a neutral response, whereas the combination of a noncommunicative mother with tickling evokes negative reactions in infants. These findings suggest that maternal social communication affects infants' reactions to touch. In addition, the combination of tactile and social stimulations elicits laughter in infants over 6months of age.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				AUG	2013	18			1			E69	E80		10.1111/infa.12029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12029													WOS:000326032400004

Parental Speech at 6 Months Predicts Joint Attention at 12 Months	INFANCY												In a prospective longitudinal study of a representative community sample (N=264), mothers' references to infants' mental states were coded during a topic-sharing task in the home at 6months. Joint attention behaviour was assessed in the laboratory at 12months. Individual joint attention skills (gaze following, gaze alternating, and declarative pointing) were significantly inter-correlated, with a single factor accounting for 68% of the variance. Mothers' references to infants' mental states at 6months predicted infants' joint attention at 12months. The association was not explained by sociodemographic characteristics of the family, the mother's mental state, or by the quantity or acoustic properties of her speech. However, variability in pitch of maternal speech was an independent predictor of the infants' later joint attention skills. Taken together, these findings suggest that mothers' infant-directed speech fosters infants' attentive participation in topic-sharing interactions, which in turn provide an important arena in which joint attention skills develop over the first year of life.

We extended this research to a new domain, infant perception of the expressions of other infants. In an intermodal matching procedure, 3.5- and 5-month-old infants heard a series of infant vocal expressions (positive and negative affect) along with side-by-side dynamic videos in which one infant conveyed positive facial affect and another infant conveyed negative facial affect. Results demonstrated that 5-month-olds matched the vocal expressions with the affectively congruent facial expressions, whereas 3.5-month-olds showed no evidence of matching. These findings indicate that by 5months of age, infants detect, discriminate, and match the facial and vocal affective displays of other infants. Further, because the facial and vocal expressions were portrayed by different infants and shared no face-voice synchrony, temporal, or intensity patterning, matching was likely based on detection of a more general affective valence common to the face and voice.

Trajectories of Parenting During Infancy: The Role of Infant Temperament and Marital Adjustment for Mothers and Fathers	INFANCY												Although it is well accepted that parents greatly impact infant development, it is less clear which factors impact change in quantity and quality of parenting across infancy. This longitudinal study (N=120 families) investigated how infant temperament and marital adjustment related to trajectories of mother and father involvement and sensitivity across infancy using multilevel models. Parental involvement (caregiving and play), infant temperament (surgency, negative affectivity, regulation), and marital adjustment were assessed from questionnaires when the infant was 3, 5, 7, 12, 14, and 20months of age; parental sensitivity was coded from two episodes of the Still-Face Paradigm in early infancy (3, 5, and 7months). On average, mothers showed higher levels of caregiving, play, and sensitivity than fathers. Mother caregiving, play, and sensitivity increased over time. Father caregiving and play also increased over time, whereas sensitivity did not change with age. Happier marriages were related to increased play for both mothers and fathers. Infant surgency was also significantly related to caregiving, play, and sensitivity trajectories for mothers but not fathers. Findings are discussed in relation to parenting roles and family dynamics.

Effects of Familiarity and Feeding on Newborn Speech-Voice Recognition	INFANCY												Newborn infants preferentially orient to familiar over unfamiliar speech sounds. They are also better at remembering unfamiliar speech sounds for short periods of time if learning and retention occur after a feed than before. It is unknown whether short-term memory for speech is enhanced when the sound is familiar (versus unfamiliar) and, if so, whether the effect is further enhanced by feeding. We used a two-factorial design and randomized infants to one of four groups: prefeed-unfamiliar, prefeed-familiar, postfeed-unfamiliar, and postfeed-familiar. Memory for either familiar or unfamiliar speech (the infant's mother saying baby versus a female stranger saying beagle) was assessed using head turning to sound in an habituation-recovery paradigm and a retention delay of 85sec either before or after a typical milk feed. Memory for the familiar speech-voice was enhanced relative to the unfamiliar speech-voice, expressed by significantly less head turning toward the habituated sound stimulus when it was re-presented after the delay. Memory for familiar or unfamiliar speech was not significantly enhanced from pre- to postfeeding, nor was there a significant interaction. This is the first demonstration in newborns that familiarity enhances short-term memory for speech-voice sound.					; Young, Simon/A-1865-2008	Brant, Rollin/0000-0002-8026-2451; Young, Simon/0000-0001-9666-8096													1525-0008	1532-7078					2013	18	4					443	461		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00140.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00140.x													WOS:000319885500001

This longitudinal study measured infants' visual attention on a distractibility task (11months), joint attention (14months), and language outcomes (word-object association, 14months; MBCDI vocabulary size and multi-word productions at 18months of age). Path analyses were conducted for two different language outcomes. The analysis for vocabulary revealed unique direct prediction from infants' visual attention on a distractibility task (i.e., maintaining attention to a target event in the presence of competing events) and joint attention (i.e., more frequent response to tester's bids for attention) for larger vocabulary size at outcome; this model accounted for 48% of variance in vocabulary, after controlling for baseline communication status (assessed at 11months). The analysis for multi-word productions yielded direct effects for infants' distractibility, but not joint attention; this model accounted for 45% of variance in multi-word productions, again after controlling for baseline communication status. Indirect effects were not significant in either model. Results are discussed in light of the unique predictive role of attentional factors and social/attention cues for emerging language.

Dyadic Interaction: Greater than the Sum of its Parts?	INFANCY												The study of dyadic interaction plays a major role in infancy research. To advance conceptually informed measurement of dyadic interaction and integration across studies, we examined factor structure of individual parents' and infants' measures and dyadic measures from face-to-face interactions in two samples of 6-month-old infants and their parents: mothers from a demographically heterogeneous sample (N=164), and mothers and fathers (N=156) from a Caucasian middle-class sample. Results suggested that a) individual and dyadic measures, and parents' and infants' behaviors contribute independent information, b) measures of both valence and process are needed, c) there are context-general and context-specific qualities, and d) structure of dyadic interaction is more similar among mother-infant dyads from independent samples than between mother-infant and father-infant dyads within the same sample. Future research should use multiple measures incorporating valence, temporal processes, contextual influences, and behaviors of individual partners along with dyadic measures to adequately assess the quality of dyadic interaction.

Previous research using cross-sectional samples has shown an unstable ORE at 3months, an increase at 6months and full development at 9months. In Experiment 1, we tested whether 9-month-olds showed the ORE with Caucasian and African faces. As expected, the 9-month-olds discriminated faces within their own ethnicity (Caucasian) but not within the unfamiliar ethnicity (African). In months. In Experiment 2, we longitudinally tested infants at 3, 6, and 9months by presenting either the Caucasian or the African faces used in Experiment 1. In contrast to previous cross-sectional studies and Experiment 1, we found that infants discriminated between all stimuli. Hence, we did not find the ORE in this longitudinal study even at 9months. We assume that the infants in our longitudinal study showed no ORE because of previous repetitive exposure to African faces at 3 and 6months. We argue that only a few presentations of faces from other ethnic categories sufficiently slow the development of the ORE.

Infant Attention to Dynamic Audiovisual Stimuli: Look Duration From 3 to 9 Months of Age	INFANCY												The goal of this study was to examine developmental change in visual attention to dynamic visual and audiovisual stimuli in 3-, 6-, and 9-month-old infants. Infant look duration was measured during exposure to dynamic geometric patterns and Sesame Street video clips under three different stimulus modality conditions: unimodal visual, synchronous audiovisual, and asynchronous audiovisual. Infants looked longer toward Sesame Street stimuli than geometric patterns, and infants also looked longer during multimodal audiovisual (synchronous and asynchronous) presentations than during unimodal visual presentations. There was a three-way interaction of age, stimulus type, and stimulus modality. Significant differences were found within and between age groups related to stimulus modality (visual or audiovisual) while viewing Sesame Street clips. No significant interaction was found between age and stimulus type while infants viewed dynamic geometric patterns. These findings indicate that patterns of developmental change in infant attention vary based on stimulus complexity and modality of presentation.

Two groups of 7-month-olds received the same delayed-response task to assess visuo-spatial working memory, but two different habituation-dishabituation tasks to assess processing speed and recognition memory. The single-stimulus group (N=32) was familiarized with only one abstract stimulus, whereas the categorization group (N=32) received varying exemplars of the same kind. In the categorization group, infants high on working memory showed stronger habituation and dishabituation responses than infants scoring low in working memory. No corresponding relations were found for the single-stimulus group. This suggests that working memory performance is systematically linked to other basic mental skills in 7-month-olds, but that corresponding relations may not get evident in any kind of habituation-dishabituation procedure. Implications for understanding the complex interplay of basic mental abilities in infancy will be discussed.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2013	18	4					578	603		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00133.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00133.x													WOS:000319885500007

The Effects of Distraction on Cognitive Task Performance During Toddlerhood	INFANCY												We investigated the effects of distraction on attention and task performance during toddlerhood. Thirty toddlers (24- to 26-month-olds) completed different tasks (2 of each: categorization, problem solving, memory, free play) in one of two conditions: No Distraction or Distraction. The results revealed that the distractor had varying effects on performance scores depending on the task: The problem solving and memory tasks were more susceptible to distraction. In addition, the two conditions showed different patterns of attention over time. Toddlers in the No Distraction condition were more attentive, and their attention remained consistently high across the session. Toddlers in the Distraction condition increased their attention to the task and decreased their attention to the distractor in the second half of the session. This study demonstrates how the presence of distraction influences toddlers' performance on individual cognitive tasks and contributes to our understanding of distractibility and endogenous attention during toddlerhood. This work also has implications for how environmental noise, such as background television, may influence cognitive development.

This study addressed the question of whether infants would also rely on shape when shape is only a temporary attribute of an object. Specifically, we investigated whether infants realize that shape changes reliably indicate identity changes only in the case of rigid objects, but not in the case of deformable plastic objects. Twelve-month-old infants observed how either a rigid or a plastic object was placed in a box. When searching the box, they retrieved either an object with the same (no-switch event) or with a different shape (switch event). Infants correctly inferred two distinct objects in the switch event in the case of rigid objects, but not in the case of plastic objects. A control experiment confirmed that this result was not due to a lack of salience of the shape transformation. Thus, infants' re-searching behavior indicated that they viewed shape as being diagnostic in the individuation process of rigid objects only.

J	Soska, KC; Johnson, SP				Soska, Kasey C.; Johnson, Scott P.			Development of Three-Dimensional Completion of Complex Objects	INFANCY												Three-dimensional (3D) object completion, the ability to perceive the backs of objects seen from a single viewpoint, emerges at around 6months of age. Yet, only relatively simple 3D objects have been used in assessing its development. This study examined infants' 3D object completion when presented with more complex stimuli. Infants (N=48) were habituated to an L-shaped object shown from a limited viewpoint; then they were tested with volumetrically complete (solid) and incomplete (hollow) versions of the object. Four-month-olds and 6-month-old girls had no preference for either display. Six-month-old boys and both sexes at 9.5months of age showed a novelty preference for the incomplete object. A control group (N=48), only shown the test displays, had no spontaneous preference. Perceptual completion of complex 3D objects requires infants to integrate multiple, local object features and thus may tax their nascent attentional skills. Infants might use mental rotation to supplement performance, giving an advantage to young boys. Examining the development of perceptual completion of more complex 3D objects reveals distinct mechanisms for the acquisition and refinement of 3D object completion in infancy.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2013	18	3					325	344		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00127.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00127.x								33935594					WOS:000317081100002

In previous observations of this phenomenon, both naturalistic and experimental, children's parents were in the room and could potentially have influenced their behavior. In the two current studies, we gave 24-month-old children the opportunity to help an unfamiliar adult obtain an out-of-reach object when the parent (or a friendly female adult) (i) was present but passive, (ii) was present and highlighted the problem for the child, (iii) was present and actively encouraged the child to help, (iv) was present and ordered the child to help, or (v) was absent from the room. The children helped at relatively high levels and equally under all these treatment conditions. There was also no differential effect of treatment condition on children's helping in a subsequent test phase in which no parent was present, and children had to disengage from a fun activity to help. Young children's helping behavior is not potentiated or facilitated by parental behavior in the immediate situation, suggesting that it is spontaneous and intrinsically motivated.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2013	18	3					345	368		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00120.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00120.x													WOS:000317081100003

Affective and Behavioral Features of Jealousy Protest: Associations with Child Temperament, Maternal Interaction Style, and Attachment	INFANCY												This study explored variation in affective and behavioral components of infants' jealousy protests during an eliciting condition in which mother and an experimenter directed differential attention exclusively toward a rival. Variation was examined in relation to child temperamental emotionality, maternal interaction style, and attachment security. At 45weeks, intensity of infants'distress and durations of mother- and stranger-directed behavioral responses, including gaze, touch, and proximity-seeking, were observed in the eliciting condition. We also assessed infants'positive emotionality (PE) and negative emotionality (NE) and maternal interaction styles of sensitivity and engagement. At 54weeks, attachment security was measured in the Strange Situation Procedure. Findings revealed that distress differed with temperamental emotionality and maternal interaction style. Specifically, distress was greater in infants with lower PE and having mothers who displayed less sensitivity and engagement. Analyses on behavioral responses toward the experimenter revealed linkages with maternal interaction style. Specifically, experimenter-directed gaze and touch were greater among infants of mothers who demonstrated less sensitivity and engagement. Behavioral responses toward mother were found associated with quality of attachment. Specifically, mother-directed proximity and touch were highest among infants later judged insecure resistant and lowest among those later judged insecure/avoidant; with infants later judged secure displaying moderate durations of mother-directed proximal contact.

Infants' Response to the Still-Face Task After Normal and Interrupted Peek-a-Boo	INFANCY												Infants' sensitivity to the vitality or tension envelope within dyadic social exchanges was investigated by examining their responses following normal and interrupted games of peek-a-boo embedded in a Still-Face Task. Infants 56months old engaged in two modified Still-Face Tasks with their mothers. In one task, the initial interaction ended with a sequence of normal peek-a-boos that included tension build-up, peak, and release. In the other task, the initial interaction was followed by a sequence of peek-a-boos that ended with an interrupted peek-a-boo in which the build-up was followed directly by the still face. Infants showed the still-face effect with their attention and smiling when the still face followed the normal peek-a-boo sequence, but only with smiling when the still face followed the sequence with the interrupted peek-a-boo. Infants' social bidding to their mothers in the still-face phase was greater following the interrupted peek-a-boo sequence. When social exchanges are interrupted before the closure of the vitality envelope, infants respond with more attention vigilance and social bidding, demonstrating their awareness of the structure of social exchanges.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2013	18	3					400	413		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00124.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00124.x													WOS:000317081100005

Physiological Reactivity to Infant Crying and Observed Maternal Sensitivity	INFANCY												Relations between maternal sensitivity and physiological reactivity to infant crying were examined using measures of heart rate (HR) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) in 49 mothers of second-born infants. Using the Ainsworth Sensitivity Scale, an independent assessment of maternal sensitivity was made during maternal free play and bathing of their infants. Physiological reactivity was measured while mothers listened to three blocks of infant cry sounds in a standard cry paradigm. Mothers scoring high on sensitivity were compared to less sensitive mothers on both their physiological reactivity to the presented crying sounds and their physiological mean-level differences. Significant interaction effects were found for both HR and RSA. Highly sensitive mothers showed a larger increase in HR and stronger RSA withdrawal in response to the first block of cry sounds compared to less sensitive mothers. Main effects showed that highly sensitive mothers had lower mean overall HR, and higher mean RSA levels across all three blocks of crying sounds compared to less sensitive mothers. RSA withdrawal and accompanying HR increases are discussed from a polyvagal perspective as indicative of a better capability in responding to infant signals of negative affect.

Forty-eight 9-month-old infants were tested; half of them crawled for 7.1weeks on average. Infants were habituated to a video of a simplified ShepardMetzler object rotating back and forth through a 240 degrees angle around the longitudinal axis of the object. Infants were tested with videos of the same object rotating through the previously unseen 120 degrees angle and with the mirror image of that display. The results showed that the crawlers looked significantly longer at the mirror object than at the familiar object. The results support the interpretation that crawling experience is associated with 9-month-old infants' mental rotation ability.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2013	18	3					432	441		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00132.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00132.x													WOS:000317081100007

Research examining precursors of EC has been limited to date, and in this study, infancy contributors to toddler EC were examined. Specifically, parent/family background variables (e.g., education, income), maternal temperament, perceived stress, and internalizing symptoms were addressed, along with infant temperament: positive affectivity/surgency (PAS), negative emotionality (NE), and regulatory capacity/orienting (RCO); and laboratory observation-based indicators of attention. Infant attention indexed by the latency to look away after initially orienting to the presented stimuli emerged as an important predictor of later EC, after accounting for other child and parent/family attributes, with shorter latencies predicting higher levels of EC. Mothers' extraversion and parenting stress were the only parent/family attributes to significantly contribute to the prediction of toddler EC, with the former promoting and the latter undermining the development of EC. Infant temperament factors were also examined as a moderator of parent/family influences, with results indicating a significant interaction between mothers' EC and infant RCO, so that children with greater RCO and mothers high in EC exhibited the highest EC scores in toddlerhood.

Anger and Positive Reactivity in Infancy: Effects on Maternal Report of Surgency and Attention Focusing in Early Childhood	INFANCY												We examined two aspects of temperamental approach in early infancy, positive reactivity and anger, and their unique and combined influences on maternal reports of child surgency and attention focusing at 4years of age. One hundred and fourteen infants were observed for their positive reactions to novel stimuli at 4months, and their anger expressions during arm restraint at 9months. Child surgency and attention focusing at age 4years were assessed by maternal report. Infants who expressed more anger to restraint were rated higher in surgency during early childhood relative to infants who expressed less anger. The effects of positive reactivity to novelty on attention focusing were moderated by anger to restraint. These findings suggest that infant temperamental approach tendencies are multifaceted and have both unique and combined influences on later maternal report of attention and social behavior.

The present study examined early infant production of coy smiles during social interactions as a measure of positive shy behavior. Eighty 4-month-olds were experimentally observed during three types of interactions in front of a mirror in which (1) the infant only sees him or herself, (2) the infant only sees the other person (mother, father, or stranger), and (3) the infant sees both him or herself and the other person. Infants produced more coy smiles during the interaction with a stranger than during the interactions with their mother or their father, or when they could see only themselves in front of a mirror. Infants also produced more coy smiles when they could see their self-reflection during the interaction than when they could not. Our results support the assumption that coy smiles indicate an early emerging emotional reaction with an important adaptive function during social situations involving novel persons and when special attention is given to the child.

Oculomotor Exploration of Impossible Figures in Early Infancy	INFANCY												Previous studies have revealed that young infants can distinguish between displays of possible or impossible figures, which may require detection of inconsistent depth relations among local line junctions that disrupt global object configurations. Here, we used an eye-tracking paradigm to record eye movements in young infants during an object discrimination task with matched pairs of possible and impossible figures. Our goal was to identify differential patterns of oculomotor activity as infants viewed pictures of possible and impossible objects. We predicted that infants would actively attend to specific pictorial depth cues that denote shape (e.g., T-junctions), and in the context of an impossible figure that they would fixate to a greater extent in anomalous regions of the display relative to other parts. By the age of 4months, infants fixated reliably longer overall on displays of impossible versus possible cubes, specifically within the critical region where the incompatible lines and irreconcilable depth relations were located, implying an early capacity for selective attention to critical line junction information and integration of local depth cues necessary to perceive object coherence.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2013	18	2					221	232		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00115.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00115.x								23646001					WOS:000314753100004

Physiological Regulation at 9 Months of Age in Infants Prenatally Exposed to Cigarettes	INFANCY												The primary purpose of this study was to examine the association between prenatal cigarette exposure and physiological regulation at 9months of age. Specifically, we explored the possibility that any association between prenatal cigarette exposure and infant physiological regulation was moderated by postnatal environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure or infant gender. We evaluated whether male infants with prenatal cigarette exposure or infants who were also exposed to ETS after birth had the highest levels of physiological dysregulation. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was obtained from 206 (142 exposed and 64 nonexposed) infants during a baseline period and during procedures designed to elicit both positive and negative affect. There was a significant suppression of RSA during the negative affect task for nonexposed infants, but not for exposed infants. Postnatal ETS exposure did not moderate this association; however, gender did moderate this association such that boys with prenatal cigarette exposure had a significant increase in RSA rather than the suppression seen among both nonexposed boys and girls. These results provide additional support for the idea that boys are particularly vulnerable to the effects of prenatal cigarette exposure.

Effects of Ownership Rights on Conflicts Between Toddler Peers	INFANCY												This study examined property conflicts in thirty-two 20- and 30-month-old peer dyads during eighteen 40-min play sessions. Ownership influenced conflicts. Both 20- and 30-month-old owners claimed ownership (mine) and instigated and won property conflicts more often than non-owners. At 30months, owners also resisted peers' instigations more often than non-owners. Mothers' interventions supported non-owners more often than owners, in part because owners initiated conflict more frequently. Children who received mothers' support tended to win disputes. Finally, mothers' support of owners and children's adherence to ownership rights led to decreased conflict as relationships developed, supporting predictions based on theories concerning the social utility of ownership rights.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2013	18	2					256	275		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00121.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00121.x													WOS:000314753100006

The Organization of Words and Symbolic Gestures in 18-Month-Olds' Lexicons: Evidence From a Disambiguation Task	INFANCY												Infants' early communicative repertoires include both words and symbolic gestures. The current study examined the extent to which infants organize words and gestures in a single unified lexicon. As a window into lexical organization, eighteen-month-olds' (N=32) avoidance of wordgesture overlap was examined and compared with avoidance of wordword overlap. The current study revealed that when presented with novel words, infants avoided lexical overlap, mapping novel words onto novel objects. In contrast, when presented with novel gestures, infants sought overlap, mapping novel gestures onto familiar objects. The results suggest that infants do not treat words and gestures as equivalent lexical items and that during a period of development when word and symbolic gesture processing share many similarities, important differences also exist between these two symbolic forms.

The Goal Trumps the Means: Highlighting Goals is More Beneficial than Highlighting Means in Means-End Training	INFANCY												Means-end actions are an early-emerging form of problem solving. These actions require initiating initial behaviors with a goal in mind. In this study, we explored the origins of 8-month-old infants' means-end action production using a cloth-pulling training paradigm. We examined whether highlighting the goal (toy) or the means (cloth) was more valuable for learning to perform a well-organized means-end action. Infants were given the opportunity to both practice cloth-pulling and view modeling of the action performed by an adult throughout the session. Infants saw either the same toy or the same cloth in successive trials, so that the goal or means were highlighted prior to modeling of the action. All infants improved throughout the session regardless of which aspect of the event was highlighted. Beyond this general improvement, repetition of goals supported more rapid learning and more sustained learning than did repetition of means. These findings provide novel evidence that, at the origins of means-end action production, emphasizing the goal that structures an action facilitates the learning of new means-end actions.

J	Brownell, CA				Brownell, Celia A.			Early Development of Prosocial Behavior: Current Perspectives	INFANCY												Prosocial behavior first appears in the second year of life. How can prosociality so early in life be explained? One possibility is that infants possess specialized cognitive and/or social capacities that drive its emergence. A second possibility is that prosocial behavior emerges out of infants' shared activities and relationships with others. These possibilities have motivated a number of current explanatory efforts, with a focus on two complementary questions. First, what is evolutionarily prepared in the very young child and how does it give rise to prosocial behavior? Second, how do proximal mechanisms, including social experiences, contribute to the early development of prosociality? The papers in this special issue represent some of the most recent work on these questions. They highlight a diverse array of new methods and bring them to bear on the nature and development of early prosocial understanding and behavior.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2013	18	1			SI		1	9		10.1111/infa.12004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/infa.12004								25632273					WOS:000312649600001

Active Experience Shapes 10-Month-Old Infants' Understanding of Collaborative Goals	INFANCY												Collaborative activities in which individuals coordinate their actions to attain a common goal play a fundamental role in our everyday lives. Evidence suggests that infants engage in collaborative activities before their first birthday; however, little is known about infants understanding of collaborative action. Using a visual habituation paradigm, this research consists of two experiments designed to investigate whether 10-month-olds understand that the actions of collaborative partners are critical to the attainment of a common goal. The results of Experiment 1 suggest that 10-month-olds represent the actions of collaborating partners in terms of a common collaborative goal only after receiving active experience with a collaborative activity. Experiment 2 demonstrated that infants who received active experience with a collaborative activity viewed active engagement in a collaboration as being critical for an individuals actions to be interpreted as being directed towards a collaborative goal. Together, these findings demonstrate that 10-month-olds exhibit an understanding of the shared nature of collaborative goals after a highly salient experience with the activity. Identifying the effects of experience on infants understanding of collaborative goals in a laboratory context provides insights into the role that experiences in their everyday lives might play in their understanding of collaboration.					wang, grace/D-9662-2015	Henderson, Annette/0000-0003-4384-4791; Woodward, Amanda/0000-0002-9383-9969													1525-0008						2013	18	1			SI		10	39		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00126.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00126.x								23304074					WOS:000312649600002

Here, we review three studies which show that young children (1) are intrinsically motivated rather than motivated by extrinsic rewards; (2) are more inclined to help those for whom they feel sympathy; and (3) are not so much motivated to provide help themselves as to see the person helped (as can be seen in changes of their sympathetic arousal, as measured by pupil dilation, in different circumstances). Young childrens prosocial behavior is thus intrinsically motivated by a concern for others welfare, which has its evolutionary roots in a concern for the well-being of those with whom one is interdependent.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2013	18	1			SI		67	90		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00130.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00130.x													WOS:000312649600004

The methodological challenges of assessing prosocial behavior in very young children are considered next. We then discuss the origins of prosocial motivation in the early years, focusing on developing understanding of others' goals and intentions, the emergence of sensitivity to equity, emotion understanding, and other conceptual advances.

Scanning of inverted faces was statistically indistinguishable at 4.5, 6.5, 8, and 12.5 months of age; at each of these ages, infants disproportionately scanned the region containing the eyes. Scanning of upright faces changed over this age range. When viewing upright faces, 4.5-month-old and 6.5-month-old infants focused disproportionately on the region containing the eyes, whereas 12.5-month-old and 8-month-old infants distributed looking more broadly, scanning more of the internal area of the faces. These results are consistent with other observed developmental differences in face processing and provide insight into how moment-to-moment face processing changes during infancy.

H.; Yun, Jung-eun; Burns, Monica			The Development of Fairness Expectations and Prosocial Behavior in the Second Year of Life	INFANCY												Recent work provides evidence that expectations regarding a fair (i.e., equal) distribution of goods and resources arise sometime in the second year of life. To investigate the developmental trajectory of fairness expectations, and their potential relation to prosocial behavior, infants participated in a violation-of-expectancy (VOE) paradigm designed to assess expectations regarding how resources are typically distributed, and in a sharing task, an informational helping task, and an instrumental helping task. Infants expectations regarding resource distribution showed age-related changes between 12 and 15 months, with only 15-month-old infants showing greater attention to unfair (unequal) over fair (equal) outcomes in the VOE. Individual differences in infants sensitivity to unfair outcomes were related to infants willingness to share a preferred toy. In contrast, helping behavior was unrelated to infants sensitivity to unfair outcomes and did not vary according to whether infants shared a preferred or non-preferred toy during the sharing task. Our findings suggest a developmental transition in expectations regarding how resources are distributed from 12 to 15 months of age, linked to infants sharing behavior, suggesting that such expectations are learned through experience. Our results also contribute to the ongoing discussion regarding how best to assess the construct of prosociality in infancy.						Schmidt, Marco F.

We examined one potential socialization mechanism parents discourse about others emotions with very young children in whom prosocial behavior is still nascent. Two studies are reported, one of sharing in 18- and 24-month-olds (n = 29) and one of instrumental and empathy-based helping in 18- and 30-month-olds (n = 62). In both studies, parents read age-appropriate picture books to their children, and the content and structure of their emotion-related and internal state discourse were coded. Results showed that children who helped and shared more quickly and more often, especially in tasks that required more complex emotion understanding, had parents who more often asked them to label and explain the emotions depicted in the books. Moreover, it was parents elicitation of childrens talk about emotions rather than parents own production of emotion labels and explanations that explained childrens prosocial behavior, even after controlling for age. Thus, it is the quality, not the quantity, of parents talk about emotions with their toddlers that matters for early prosocial behavior.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2013	18	1			SI		91	119		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00125.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2012.00125.x								23264753					WOS:000312649600005
J	Grossmann, T				Grossmann, Tobias			Mapping Prefrontal Cortex Functions in Human Infancy	INFANCY												It has long been thought that the prefrontal cortex, as the seat of most higher brain functions, is functionally silent during most of infancy. This review highlights recent work concerned with the precise mapping (localization) of brain activation in human infants, providing evidence that prefrontal cortex exhibits functional activation much earlier than previously thought. A systematic evaluation of the activation patterns in these neuroimaging studies mainly based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy reveals that prefrontal cortex function can be broadly divided into two distinct anatomical clusters with different functional properties. One cluster of activations falls within the region of the medial prefrontal cortex and is mainly involved in affective processes; another cluster is located in lateral aspects of the prefrontal cortex and shows sensitivity to cognitive processes such as memory and attention. This distinction is in line with adult data and evolutionary models and may represent a developmentally continuous organization principle of prefrontal cortex function. All in all, this review is aimed at providing a synthesis of new findings that are emerging from the use of neuroimaging techniques with infants as well as at encouraging further theory-driven research to understand the developmental origins of prefrontal cortex function.

Increased Focus on the Mouth Among Infants in the First Year of Life: A Longitudinal Eye-Tracking Study	INFANCY												This study examines face-scanning behaviors of infants at 6, 9, and 12months as they watched videos of a woman describing an object in front of her. The videos were created to vary information in the mouth (speaking vs. smiling) and the eyes (gazing into the camera vs. cueing the infant with head turn or gaze direction to an object being described). Infants tended to divide their attention between the eyes and the mouth, looking less at the eyes with age and more at the mouth than the eyes at 9 and 12months. Attention to the mouth was greater on speaking trials than on smiling trials at all three ages, and this difference increased between 6 and 9months. Despite consistent results within subjects, there was considerable variation between subjects. This raises the question of whether a developmental norm of face scanning in infancy ought to be pursued. Rather, these data add to emerging evidence suggesting that individual differences in face scanning might reliably predict aspects of later development.

Rhythmic Grouping Biases Constrain Infant Statistical Learning	INFANCY												Linguistic stress and sequential statistical cues to word boundaries interact during speech segmentation in infancy. However, little is known about how the different acoustic components of stress constrain statistical learning. The current studies were designed to investigate whether intensity and duration each function independently as cues to initial prominence (trochaic-based hypothesis) or whether, as predicted by the Iambic-Trochaic Law (ITL), intensity and duration have characteristic and separable effects on rhythmic grouping (ITL-based hypothesis) in a statistical learning task. Infants were familiarized with an artificial language (Experiments 1 and 3) or a tone stream (Experiment 2) in which there was an alternation in either intensity or duration. In addition to potential acoustic cues, the familiarization sequences also contained statistical cues to word boundaries. In speech (Experiment 1) and nonspeech (Experiment 2) conditions, 9-month-old infants demonstrated discrimination patterns consistent with an ITL-based hypothesis: intensity signaled initial prominence and duration signaled final prominence. The results of Experiment 3, in which 6.5-month-old infants were familiarized with the speech streams from Experiment 1, suggest that there is a developmental change in infants willingness to treat increased duration as a cue to word offsets in fluent speech. Infants perceptual systems interact with linguistic experience to constrain how infants learn from their auditory environment.

J	Stenberg, G				Stenberg, Gunilla			Why do Infants Look at and Use Positive Information from Some Informants Rather Than Others in Ambiguous Situations?	INFANCY												Three laboratory experiments on social referencing examined whether infants tendencies to look at and use positive information from the experimenter could be interpreted from a perspective of novelty or expertise. In Study 1, novelty was manipulated. Forty-eight 12-month-old infants participated. In a between-subject design, a more novel or a less novel experimenter presented an ambiguous object and provided positive information. The infants looked more at and regulated their behavior more in accordance with information coming from the less novel experimenter. In Study 2, expertise was manipulated. Forty-eight 12-month-old infants were exposed to one experimenter who showed expertise about the laboratory situation and one experimenter who did not show such competence. The infants looked more at and regulated their behavior more in accordance with information coming from the expert. In Study 3, 40 12-month-old infants participated. The infants were exposed to a toy-expert who was either novel or familiar. The infants, in both groups, looked as much at the toy-experts and used the information regardless of whether the novel or familiar toy-expert had provided information. The findings suggest that novelty does not increase looking in ambiguous situations. Instead, the results support the expertise perspective of infant looking preferences.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2012	17	6					642	671		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00108.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00108.x								32693491					WOS:000309451100003
J	Knudsen, B; Liszkowski, U				Knudsen, Birgit; Liszkowski, Ulf			18-Month-Olds Predict Specific Action Mistakes Through Attribution of False Belief, Not Ignorance, and Intervene Accordingly	INFANCY												This study employed a new anticipatory intervening paradigm to tease apart false belief and ignorance-based interpretations of 18-month-olds helpful informing. We investigated in three experiments whether 18-month-old infants inform an adult selectively about one of the two locations depending on the adults belief about which of the two locations held her toy. In experiments 1 and 2, the adult falsely believed that one of the locations held her toy. In experiment 3, the adult was ignorant about which of the two locations held her toy. In all cases, however, the toy had been removed from the locations and the locations contained instead materials which the adult wanted to avoid. In experiments 1 and 2, infants spontaneously and selectively informed the adult about the aversive material in the location the adult falsely believed to hold her toy. In contrast, in experiment 3, infants informed the ignorant adult about both locations equally. Results reveal that infants expected the adult to commit a specific action mistake when she held a false belief, but not when she was ignorant. Further, infants were motivated to intervene proactively. Findings reveal a predictive action-based usage of theory-of-mind skills at 18 months of age.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2012	17	6					672	691		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00105.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00105.x								32693489					WOS:000309451100004

Peripheral Stimulus Localization by Infants of Moving Stimuli on Complex Backgrounds	INFANCY												This study examined the effect of attention in young infants on the saccadic localization of dynamic peripheral stimuli presented on complex and interesting backgrounds. Infants at 14, 20, and 26 weeks of age were presented with scenes from a Sesame Street movie until fixation on a moving character occurred and then presented with a second segment in the scene in which the character movement occurred in a new location. Localization of the moving character in the new location was faster when the infant was engaged in attention than when inattentive, for scenes in which the character moved from one location to another, or scenes in which the character stopped moving and characters in new locations began moving. However, localization of the character was slower during attention when the first character disappeared and a different character appeared in a new location. We also found a decrease in the linear component of the main sequence in the saccade characteristics over the three testing ages, and attention affected the main sequence for infants at the two oldest ages. These results partially replicate prior findings showing that attention to a focal stimulus affects localization of peripheral stimuli, but suggest that the nature of the stimuli being localized modifies the role of attention in affecting eye movements to peripheral stimuli.

Maternal Caregiving Moderates the Relation Between Temperamental Fear and Social Behavior with Peers	INFANCY												Temperament works in combination with a childs environment to influence early socioemotional development. We examined whether maternal caregiving behavior at infant age 9 months moderated the relation between infant temperamental fear (9 months) and observations of childrens social behavior with an unfamiliar peer at age 2 in a typically developing sample of 155 children. When infants received lower quality maternal caregiving, temperamental fear was inversely related to observed social engagement and aggression. These relations were nonsignificant when infants received higher quality maternal caregiving. Findings indicate that variations in temperamental fear may predict individual differences in future peer interactions, but sensitive, nonintrusive caregiving behaviors can attenuate these associations.

Infant Distress and Regulatory Behaviors Vary as a Function of Attachment Security Regardless of Emotion Context and Maternal Involvement	INFANCY												Differences in infant distress and regulatory behaviors based on the quality of attachment to mother, emotion context (frustration versus fear), and whether or not mothers were actively involved in the emotion-eliciting tasks were examined in a sample of ninety-eight 16-month-old infants and their mothers. Dyads participated in the Strange Situation, a limiting task designed to elicit infant frustration, and a novelty task designed to elicit infant fear. Mothers were asked to remain uninvolved during the first minute of each task and then instructed to engage with their infants as they wished for the remaining 3 min. Independent of concurrent maternal sensitivity, resistant infants were significantly more distressed than secure and avoidant infants. Avoidant infants engaged in fewer active mother-oriented regulation behaviors than secure and resistant infants and engaged in more self-soothing in the mother-involved condition than the mother-uninvolved condition. Resistant infants engaged in more physical comfort with their mothers and more venting than both secure and avoidant infants and exhibited a smaller variety of adaptive non-mother-oriented strategies than did secure infants. There were few differences in infant distress and regulatory behaviors as a function of emotion task and maternal involvement. Limitations and implications for future research are discussed.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2012	17	5					455	478		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00099.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00099.x								22919285					WOS:000307122800001

To Grasp or Not to Grasp: Infants' Actions Toward Objects and Pictures	INFANCY												We conducted two experiments to address questions over whether 9-month-old infants believe that objects depicted in realistic photographs can be picked up. In Experiment 1, we presented 9-month-old infants with realistic color photographs of objects, colored outlines of objects, abstract colored blobs, and blank pages. Infants most commonly rubbed or patted depictions of all types. They also showed significantly more grasps toward the realistic photographs than toward the colored outlines, blobs, and blank pages, but only 24% of infants directed grasping exclusively at the photographs. In Experiment 2, we further explored infants actions toward objects and pictures while controlling for tactile information. We presented 9-month-old infants with objects and pictures of objects under a glass cover in a false-bottom table. Although there were no significant differences between the proportion of rubs and pats infants directed toward the objects versus the photographs, infants exhibited significantly more grasping toward the objects than the photographs. Together, these findings show that 9-month-old infants largely direct appropriate actions toward realistic photographs and real objects, indicating that they perceive different affordances for pictures and objects.																			1525-0008						2012	17	5					479	497		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00100.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00100.x								32693549					WOS:000307122800002
J	Gonzalez-Gomez, N; Nazzi, T				Gonzalez-Gomez, Nayeli; Nazzi, Thierry			Acquisition of Nonadjacent Phonological Dependencies in the Native Language During the First Year of Life	INFANCY												Languages instantiate many different kinds of dependencies, some holding between adjacent elements and others holding between nonadjacent elements. In the domain of phonologyphonotactics, sensitivity to adjacent dependencies has been found to appear between 6 and 10 months. However, no study has directly established the emergence of sensitivity to nonadjacent phonological dependencies in the native language. The present study focuses on the emergence of a perceptual Labial-Coronal (LC) bias, a dependency involving two nonadjacent consonants. First, Experiment 1 shows that a preference for monosyllabic consonant-vowel-consonant LC words over CL (Coronal-Labial) words emerges between 7 and 10 months in French-learning infants. Second, two experiments, presenting only the first or last two phonemes of the original stimuli, establish that the LC bias at 10 months cannot be explained by adjacent dependencies or by a preference for more frequent coronal consonants (Experiment 2a & b). At 7 months, by contrast, infants appear to react to the higher frequency of coronal consonants (Experiment 3a & b). The present study thus demonstrates that infants become sensitive to nonadjacent phonological dependencies between 7 and 10 months. It further establishes a change between these two ages from sensitivity to local properties to nonadjacent dependencies in the phonological domain.																			1525-0008						2012	17	5					498	524		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00104.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00104.x								32693545					WOS:000307122800003

Effects of Exogenous and Endogenous Distracters on Immediate and Long-Term Recall in Toddlers	INFANCY												We explored the role that exogenous and endogenous competitors for attention play in infants abilities to encode and retain information over a 6-month period. Sixty-six children visited the laboratory at 15 months, and 32 returned for a second visit at 21 months. Children observed models of conventional- relation and enabling-relation action sequences. Half the children were distracted by a Mister Monkey mechanical toy during the conventional-relation sequence, while the other half was distracted during the enabling-relation sequence. The Early Childhood Behavior Questionnaire indexed endogenous factors at both ages. Immediate postmodel production of target actions indexed encoding efficiency, and 6-month production of target actions indexed long-term recall. The exogenous distracter impacted encoding efficiency (i.e., immediate recall), but not long-term recall. Endogenous factors (i.e., temperament) were primarily associated with long-term recall. Of special interest was our finding that endogenous factors, especially surgency, moderated the effect of the exogenous distracter. It appears that when learning conventional-relation sequences in the presence of exogenous distracters, surgency mobilizes attentional resources toward the learning objective; however, when learning enabling-relation sequences under the same conditions, surgency either boosts the saliency of the distracters or boosts childrens susceptibility to them.

Let Me Go: The Influences of Crawling Experience and Temperament on the Development of Anger Expression	INFANCY												Infants emerging ability to move independently by crawling is associated with changes in multiple domains, including an increase in expressions of anger in situations that block infants goals, but it is unknown whether increased anger is specifically because of experience with being able to move autonomously or simply related to age. To examine the influence of locomotion on developmental change in anger, infants (N = 20) anger expressions during an arm restraint procedure were observed longitudinally at a precrawling baseline assessment and 2 and 6 weeks after the onset of crawling. Infant age at each crawling stage was unrelated to the frequency of anger expressed in response to arm restraint. At 6 weeks postcrawling onset, infants whose mothers rated them as temperamentally higher in distress to limitations, compared with those rated lower, showed a greater increase in the frequency of anger expressed during the arm restraint relative to earlier assessments and took longer to reduce the frequency of anger expressed when no longer restrained. Findings suggest that experience with autonomous crawling has an effect on anger expression, independent of age, and that a temperamental tendency to become distressed by limitations may exacerbate the effect of crawling on anger expression.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2012	17	5					558	577		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00092.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00092.x								32693548					WOS:000307122800005

Race-Based Perceptual Asymmetry in Face Processing Is Evident Early in Life	INFANCY												Adults processing of own-race faces differs from that of other-race faces. The presence of an other-race feature (ORF) has been proposed as a mechanism underlying this specialization. We examined whether this mechanism, which was previously identified in adults and in 9-month-olds, is evident at 3.5 months. Caucasian 3.5-month-olds looked longer at a pattern containing a single Asian face among seven Caucasian faces than at a pattern containing a single Caucasian face among seven Asian faces. Homogenous and inverted face control conditions indicated that infants preference was not driven by the majority of faces in arrays or by low-level features. Thus, 3.5-month-olds found the presence of an other-race face among own-race faces to be more salient than the reverse configuration. This asymmetry suggests sensitivity to an ORF at 3.5 months. Thus, a key mechanism of race-based processing in adults has an early onset, indicating rapid development of specialization early in life.

Although many studies have examined the perception of faces and of goal-directed actions, relatively little work has focused on what children will look at in complex and unconstrained viewing environments. To address this question, we showed videos of objects, faces, children playing with toys, and complex social scenes to a large sample of infants and toddlers between 3 and 30 months old. We found systematic developmental changes in what children looked at. When viewing faces alone, younger children looked more at eyes and older children more at mouths, especially when the faces were making expressions or talking. In the more complex videos, older children looked more at hands than younger children, especially when the hands were performing actions. Our results suggest that as children develop they become better able to direct their attention to the parts of complex scenes that are most interesting socially.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2012	17	4					355	375		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00086.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00086.x								32693486					WOS:000304820600001

The Organization of Wariness of Heights in Experienced Crawlers	INFANCY												Most infants with more than 6 weeks of crawling experience completely avoid the deep side of a visual cliff (Campos, Bertenthal, & Kermoian, 1992; Gibson & Walk, 1960). However, some experienced crawlers do move onto the transparent surface suspended several feet above the ground. An important question is whether these nonavoiders lack wariness of heights or whether they have a qualitatively different way of showing their wariness than do avoiders of the deep side. The current study addressed this question by measuring heart rate (HR) acceleration upon being lowered on the deep and shallow sides of the visual cliff, latency to crawl toward the mother, and tactile exploration of the cliff surface. Nonavoiders and avoiders had indistinguishable patterns of HR acceleration, showing greater HR acceleration when lowered onto the deep than when lowered onto the shallow side of the cliff. Nonavoiders also showed more tactile exploration and longer latencies than did a comparable group of infants tested on the shallow side. This study illustrates how the same emotion, wariness of heights, can be shown by qualitatively different behaviors, all serving the same function of protecting the individual from falling over a drop-off.																			1525-0008						2012	17	4					376	392		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00083.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00083.x								24817830					WOS:000304820600002

Multinomial logistic regression analyses showed that higher scores for appropriate mind-related comments and lower scores for non-attuned mind-related comments distinguished secure-group mothers from their counterparts in the insecure-avoidant, insecure-resistant, and insecure-disorganized groups. Higher scores for appropriate mind-related comments and lower scores for non-attuned mind-related comments also independently predicted dichotomous organized/disorganized attachment. General maternal sensitivity predicted neither attachment security nor organization, although sensitivity was found to relate to dichotomous secure/insecure attachment specifically in the context of low socioeconomic status. The findings highlight how appropriate and non-attuned mind-related comments make independent contributions to attachment and suggest that mind-mindedness is best characterized as a multidimensional construct.

The current study reports a result in which behavioral measures and physiological measures were both incorporated in a task designed to study infant number discrimination. Seven-month-old infants were habituated to several sets of stimuli varying in object type, but of a constant numerical value (either two or three items). Although looking time to each of the test trials revealed no differences, differences in heart rate defined measures of attention revealed infants ability to discriminate number. These findings imply that the inclusion of indices other than behavioral measures should become commonplace in studies of infant cognition.

Visual Sequence Learning in Infancy: Domain-General and Domain-Specific Associations With Language	INFANCY												Research suggests that nonlinguistic sequence learning abilities are an important contributor to language development (Conway, Bauernschmidt, Huang, & Pisoni, 2010). The current study investigated visual sequence learning (VSL) as a possible predictor of vocabulary development in infants. Fifty-eight 8.5-month-old infants were presented with a three-location spatiotemporal sequence of multicolored geometric shapes. Early language skills were assessed using the MacArthur-Bates CDI. Analyses of childrens reaction times to the stimuli suggest that the extent to which infants demonstrated learning was significantly correlated with their vocabulary comprehension at the time of test and with their gestural comprehension abilities 5 months later. These findings suggest that VSL may have both domain-general and domain-specific associations with language learning.

J	Shinskey, JL				Shinskey, Jeanne L.			Disappearing Decalage: Object Search in Light and Dark at 6 Months	INFANCY												Infants search for an object hidden by an occluder in the light months later than one hidden by darkness. One explanation attributes this decalage to easier action demands in darkness versus occlusion, whereas another attributes it to easier representation demands in darkness versus occlusion. However, search tasks typically confound these two types of demands. This article presents a search task that unconfounds them to better address these two explanations of the dark advantage. Objects were hidden by submersion in liquid instead of occlusion with a screen, allowing infants to search with equally simple actions in light versus dark. In Experiment 1, 6-month-olds unexpectedly showed a dark disadvantage by discriminating when an object was hidden in the light but not the dark. Experiment 2 addressed the possibility that representation demands were higher in the dark than the light and showed that infants search in the dark increased to match that in the light, but not exceed it. Six-month-olds can thus search for a hidden object both when action demands are simplified and when a noncohesive substance rather than a cohesive occluder hides the object, supporting aspects of both action-demand and representation-demand explanations of decalage in search behavior.

J	Kucker, SC; Samuelson, LK				Kucker, Sarah C.; Samuelson, Larissa K.			The First Slow Step: Differential Effects of Object and Word-Form Familiarization on Retention of Fast-Mapped Words	INFANCY												Recent research demonstrated that although 24-month-old infants do well on the initial pairing of a novel word and novel object in fast-mapping tasks, they are unable to retain the mapping after a 5 min delay. The current study examines the role of familiarity with the objects and words on infants ability to bridge between the initial fast mapping of a name and object, and later retention in the service of slow mapping. Twenty-four-month-old infants were familiarized with either novel objects or novel names prior to the referent selection portion of a fast-mapping task. When familiarized with the novel objects, infants retained the novel mapping after a delay, but not when familiarized with the novel words. This suggests familiarity with the object versus the word form leads to differential encoding of the nameobject link. We discuss the implications of this finding for subsequent slow mapping.

Extending previous findings reported by K. A. Kovack-Lesh, J. S. Horst, and L. M. Oakes (2008), we found that 4-month-old infants (N = 122) learning of the exclusive category of cats was related to whether they had cats at home and how much they shifted attention between two available stimuli during familiarization. Individual differences in attention assessed in an unrelated task were not related to their categorization. Thus, infants learning is multiply influenced by past experience and online attentional style.

J	Fennell, CT				Fennell, Christopher T.			Object Familiarity Enhances Infants' Use of Phonetic Detail in Novel Words	INFANCY												Infants greatly refine their ability to discriminate language sounds by 12 months, yet 14-month-olds appear to confuse similar-sounding novel words. Two explanations could account for this phenomenon: infants initially have incomplete phoneme representations, suggesting developmental discontinuity; or word-learning demands interfere with use of established phonetic detail. These hypotheses were tested at 14 months by pairing a novel word with an object preexposed to half the infants and novel to the other half. If demands are key, only preexposed infants should efficiently use phonetic detail; there is no need to concurrently learn object details with the word. If representations lack detail, object familiarity should not matter. Only infants preexposed to the object noticed a change in its label, thus challenging the discontinuity position and demonstrating the impact of object familiarity on early word learning.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2012	17	3					339	353		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00080.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00080.x								32693488					WOS:000302549500005
J	Sullivan, MW; Lewis, M				Sullivan, Margaret W.; Lewis, Michael			Relations of Early Goal-Blockage Response and Gender to Subsequent Tantrum Behavior	INFANCY												Infants and their mothers participated in a longitudinal study of the sequelae of infant goal-blockage responses. Four-month-old infants participated in a standard contingency learning and goal-blockage procedure during which anger and sad facial expressions to the blockage were coded. When infants were 12 and 20 months old, mothers completed a questionnaire about their childrens tantrums. Tantrum scores increased with age and boys tended to show more tantrum behavior than girls. Anger expressed to goal blockage at 4 months was unrelated to tantrum behavior. There was a gender by sad expression interaction. Girls who expressed sadness in response to the goal blockage had lower total tantrum scores than boys; otherwise there was no difference. These results suggest that tantrums of infants who display sad, not anger expression, in response to goal blockage, are differentially influenced by childrens gender.

J	Mash, C; Bornstein, MH				Mash, Clay; Bornstein, Marc H.			5-Month-Olds' Categorization of Novel Objects: Task and Measure Dependence	INFANCY												To examine key parameters of the initial conditions in early category learning, two studies compared 5-month-olds object categorization between tasks involving previously unseen novel objects, and between measures within tasks. Infants in Experiment 1 participated in a visual familiarizationnovelty preference (VFNP) task with two-dimensional (2D) stimulus images. Infants provided no evidence of categorization by either their looking or their examining even though infants in previous research systematically categorized the same objects by examining when they could handle them directly. Infants in Experiment 2 participated in a VFNP task with 3D stimulus objects that allowed visual examination of objects 3D instantiation while denying manual contact with the objects. Under these conditions, infants demonstrated categorization by examining but not by looking. Focused examination appears to be a key component of young infants ability to form category representations of novel objects, and 3D instantiation appears to better engage such examining.																			1525-0008						2012	17	2					179	197		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00076.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00076.x								23024609					WOS:000299830000003

These two languages belong to different rhythm classes; Canadian French is syllable-timed and Canada English is stress-timed. Findings of Experiments 1, 2, and 3 show that 8-month-olds acquiring either Canadian French or Canadian English can segment bi-syllable words in their native language. Thus, word segmentation is not inherently more difficult in a syllable-timed compared to a stress-timed language. Experiment 4 shows that Canadian French-learning infants can segment words in European French. Experiment 5 shows that neither Canadian French- nor Canadian English-learning infants can segment two syllable words in the other language. Thus, segmentation abilities of 8-month-olds acquiring either a stress-timed or syllable-timed language are language specific.

Young Infants Exhibit Stable Patterns of Attention During Interaction	INFANCY												The degree to which infants current actions are influenced by previous action is fundamental to our understanding of early social and cognitive competence. In this study, we found that infant gazing manifested notable temporal dependencies during interaction with mother even when controlling for mother behaviors. The durations of infant gazes at mothers face were positively predicted by the durations of the two previous gazes at mothers face. Similarly, the durations of gazes away from mothers face were positively predicted by the durations of the two previous gazes of the same type. The durations of gazes at and away from mothers face, however, were not predicted by one another. This pattern suggests that infants exhibit distinct and temporally stable levels of interest in social and nonsocial features of the environment. In this report, we discuss the implications of these results for parents, for experimental research using looking time measures, and for our understanding of infants developing communicative abilities.																			1525-0008						2012	17	2					233	244		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00074.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00074.x								22523476					WOS:000299830000005

A Critical Test of Temporal and Spatial Accuracy of the Tobii T60XL Eye Tracker	INFANCY												Infant eye tracking is becoming increasingly popular for its presumed precision relative to traditional looking time paradigms and potential to yield new insights into developmental processes. However, there is strong reason to suspect that the temporal and spatial resolution of popular eye tracking systems is not entirely accurate, potentially compromising any data from an infant eye tracking experiment. Moreover, best practices for infant eye tracking, such as knowing which software tool enhances experimental flexibility, remain to be determined. The present investigation was designed to evaluate the temporal and spatial accuracy of data from the Tobii T60XL eye tracker through the use of visual latency and spatial accuracy tasks involving adults and infants. Systematic delays and drifts were revealed in oculomotor response times, and the systems spatial accuracy was observed to deviate somewhat in excess of the manufacturers estimates; the experimental flexibility of the system appears dependent on the chosen software.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2012	17	1			SI		9	32		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00089.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00089.x								32693503					WOS:000297507700002

But the complexity and amount of gaze data recorded from state-of-the-art eye-tracking systems also pose a challenge: how does one make sense of such dense data? Toward this goal, this article describes an interactive approach based on integrating top-down domain knowledge with bottom-up information visualization and visual data mining. The key idea behind this method is to leverage the computational power of the human visual system. Thus, we propose an approach in which scientists iteratively examine and identify underlying patterns through data visualization and link those discovered patterns with top-down knowledge/hypotheses. Combining bottom-up data visualization with top-down human theoretical knowledge through visual data mining is an effective and efficient way to make discoveries from gaze data. We first provide an overview of the underlying principles of this new approach of human-in-the-loop knowledge discovery and then show several examples illustrating how this interactive exploratory approach can lead to new findings.

Pupil Dilation and Object Permanence in Infants	INFANCY												This paper examines the relative merits of looking time and pupil diameter measures in the study of early cognitive abilities of infants. Ten-month-old infants took part in a modified version of the classic drawbridge experiment used to study object permanence (Baillargeon, Spelke, & Wasserman, 1985). The study involved a factorial design where angle of rotation and presence or absence of an object were crossed. Looking time results are consistent with previous work and could suggest object permanence if one ignored data from all cells of the factorial design. When all cells are considered, the data rather suggest a perceptual interpretation. Dynamic changes in pupil diameter uniquely support this interpretation, illustrating which aspects of events (and when) infants primarily respond to. Overall, the results fail to support object permanence in 10-month-olds, and pupil dilation provides a much finer-grained interpretation of infants information processing, relative to looking time.

Finally, for each method, we briefly present some results from our studies to illustrate the different levels of analyses that may be carried out using these different types of eye-tracking devices.

The emotions were expressed by the infants own parents as well as a male and female stranger (parents of another participating infant). Rather than measuring the duration of gaze in particular areas of interest, we measured number of fixations, distribution of fixations, and pupil diameter to evaluate global scanning patterns and reactions to emotional content. The three measures were differentially sensitive to differences in parental leave, emotional expression, and face familiarity. Infants scanned and processed differently happy, neutral, and fearful faces. In addition, infants cared for by both father and mother (divided parental leave) distributed their gaze more across faces than did infants primarily cared for by one parent (in this study, the mother). Pupil diameter complemented these findings, revealing that infants had larger pupil diameter during observation of neutral emotions expressed by the parent who is not currently the primary caregiver. This study demonstrates how conclusions differ as a function of the particular eye-tracking measure used and shows that the three measures used here converge on the conclusion that 14-month-old infants processing of emotional expressions is influenced by infants exposure to fathers and mothers.

Their study raises important questions about the use of the Tobii T-series in particular, and various software and hardware in general, in different infant eye tracking paradigms. It leaves open the question of the source of the inconsistencies. Here, observations from a Tobii eye tracker are presented to elucidate possible sources of timing inconsistencies, including those found by Morgante et al. The ramifications of the reported timing inconsistencies are related to various infant paradigms. The focus is on the level of concern a researcher should have if any eye tracker displays these timing characteristics, and what corrective measures may be taken. While posing no problems for some paradigms, timing inconsistencies are potentially problematic (but correctable) when assessing event-related looking behavior. Observed timing contraindicates use in fast gaze-contingent displays (<100 ms). General suggestions are made regarding timing in eye-tracked data collection.

Eye-tracking measurement of RJA is a promising prognostic tool because it is highly precise and standardized. However, the construct validity of eye-tracking assessments of RJA has not been established. By comparing RJA an eye-tracking paradigm to responsiveness to joint attention during the ESCS, the current study evaluated the construct validity of an eye-tracking assessment of RJA for 18-month-old infant siblings of children with autism. Relations between measures of RJA and concurrent language skills and autistic symptomatology were assessed. Correlations between measures of ESCS RJA and eye-tracking RJA were statistically significant, but few relations between either ESCS or eye-tracking assessments of RJA and language or symptoms were observed.

Six-Month-Olds Comprehend Words That Refer to Parts of the Body	INFANCY												Comprehending spoken words requires a lexicon of sound patterns and knowledge of their referents in the world. Tincoff and Jusczyk (1999) demonstrated that 6-month-olds link the sound patterns Mommy and Daddy to video images of their parents, but not to other adults. This finding suggests that comprehension emerges at this young age and might take the form of very specific word-world links, as in Mommy referring only to the infants mother and Daddy referring only to the infants father. The current study was designed to investigate if 6-month-olds also show evidence of comprehending words that can refer to categories of objects. The results show that 6-month-olds link the sound patterns hand and feet to videos of an adults hand and feet. This finding suggests that very early comprehension has a capacity beyond specific, one-to-one, associations. Future research will need to consider how developing categorization abilities, social experiences, and parent word use influence the beginnings of word comprehension.

Phonological Specificity in 12-and 17-Month-Old French-Speaking Infants	INFANCY												The literature reports some contradictory results on the degree of phonological specificity of infants early lexical representations in the Romance language, French, and Germanic languages. It is not clear whether these discrepancies are because of differences in method, in language characteristics, or in participants age. In this study, we examined whether 12- and 17-month-old French-speaking infants are able to distinguish well-pronounced from mispronounced words (one or two features of their initial consonant). To this end, 46 infants participated in a preferential looking experiment in which they were presented with pairs of pictures together with a spoken word well pronounced or mispronounced. The results show that both 12- and 17-month-old infants look longer at the pictures corresponding to well-pronounced words than to mispronounced words, but show no difference between the two mispronunciation types. These results suggest that, as early as 12 months, French-speaking infants, like those exposed to Germanic languages, already possess detailed phonological representations of familiar words.

Evren; Starr, Rebecca M.; Pathman, Thanujeni			Equal Learning Does Not Result in Equal Remembering: The Importance of Post-Encoding Processes	INFANCY												Explanations of variability in long-term recall typically appeal to encoding and/or retrieval processes. However, for well over a century, it has been apparent that for memory traces to be stored successfully, they must undergo a post-encoding process of stabilization and integration. Variability in post-encoding processes is thus a potential source of age-related and individual variance in long-term recall. We examined post-encoding variability in each of two experiments. In each experiment, 20-month-old infants were exposed to novel three-step sequences in each of three encoding conditions: watch only, imitate, and learn to criterion. They were tested for recall after 15 min (as a measure of the success of encoding) and either weeks (1, 2, or 3: Experiment 1) or days (1, 2, or 4: Experiment 2) later.

No concurrent or longitudinal relations were observed between attachment security and infants' tendency to respond to an experimenter's bids for joint attention. Higher levels of initiating joint attention with an experimenter at 15 months were associated with insecure-avoidant attachment. Insecure-avoidant attachment was also associated with lower scores for initiating high-level joint attention behaviors (pointing, showing, and giving) with the mother at age 15 months. The fact that security-related differences in initiating joint attention with an experimenter were observed only once the attachment relationship was consolidated suggests that (a) attachment security may influence infants' active engagement with new social partners, and (b) insecure-avoidant infants may compensate for reduced social contact with the caregiver by initiating more interaction with other social partners.

Background Television and Infants' Allocation of Their Attention During Toy Play	INFANCY												The effect of background television on 6- and 12-month-olds' attention during 20 min of toy play was examined. During the first or second half of the session, a clip from a variety of commonly available television programs was presented. The duration and frequency of infants' looks to the toys and to the television indicated that regardless of age or program content, background television frequently got, but did not hold the infants' attention. An order effect indicated that infants looked longer at the television when it was available in the second half of the session. Examination of infants' focused attention to the toys showed a reduction in the mean length of focused episodes when the television was on. A follow-up of the infants at 24 months indicated greater resistance to distraction by the television during play. Data from the three ages showed that individual differences in the amount of viewing were moderately stable across age and across home and lab contexts.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2011	16	6					611	639		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00070.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00070.x								32693498					WOS:000296067400003

This study investigated the developmental origins of this other-race effect (ORE) by examining the role of a salient perceptual property of faces-that of skin color. Six-and 9-month-olds' recognition memory for own- and other-race faces was examined using infant-controlled habituation and visual-paired comparison at test. Infants were shown own- or other-race faces in color or with skin color cues minimized in grayscale images. Results for the color stimuli replicated previous findings that infants show an ORE in face recognition memory. Results for the grayscale stimuli showed that even when a salient perceptual cue to race, such as skin color information, is minimized, 6- to 9-month-olds, nonetheless, show an ORE in their face recognition memory. Infants' use of shape-based and configural cues for face recognition is discussed.						pascalis, olivier/0000-0003-4609-3233													1525-0008						2011	16	6					640	654		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2010.00066.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2010.00066.x								22039335					WOS:000296067400004
J	Newman, RS				Newman, Rochelle S.			2-Year-Olds' Speech Understanding in Multitalker Environments	INFANCY												Infants and toddlers are often spoken to in the presence of background sounds, including speech from other talkers. Prior work has suggested that infants 1 year of age and younger can only recognize speech when it is louder than any distracters in the environment. The present study tests 24-montholds' ability to understand speech in a multitalker environment. Children were presented with a preferential-looking task in which a target voice told them to find one of two objects. At the same time, multitalker babble was presented as a distracter, at one of four signal-to-noise ratios. Children showed some ability to understand speech and look at the appropriate referent at signal-to-noise ratios as low as -5 dB. These findings suggest that 24-month-olds are better able to selectively attend to an interesting voice in the context of competing distracter voices than are younger infants. There were significant correlations between individual children's performance and their vocabulary size, but only at one of the four noise levels; thus, it does not appear that vocabulary size is the driving factor in children's listening improvement, although it may be a contributing factor to performance in noisy environments.

Although both genetic and environmental factors are associated with anxiety, little empirical work has addressed how developing regulatory abilities work with genetic and environmental risk to exacerbate or mitigate problem behaviors. The current study was aimed at addressing this gap in research by investigating an early emerging regulatory behavior, attention control, in association with genetic and environmental risk for anxiety. Participants included 9-month-old adopted infants, their birth mothers, and adoptive parents (N = 361). Lifetime diagnosis of birth mother social phobia was obtained using structured interviews. Adoptive parents completed self-report measures of anxiety symptoms. Infant social inhibition and attention control were coded during a stranger interaction and a barrier task, respectively. Neither adoptive nor birth parent anxiety was directly associated with social inhibition. The association of attention control with social inhibition in infants was moderated by birth and adoptive parent anxiety symptoms. When infants of birth mothers with social phobia were raised by adoptive parents with high self-reported anxiety symptoms, greater attention control was associated with greater social inhibition. However, when raised by adoptive parents with low self-reported anxiety, greater attention control was associated with less social inhibition.

An infant-controlled habituation paradigm was used to teach 18- to 20-month-old English-, French-, and Japanese-speaking infants' novel words for events. Infants were habituated to two word-event pairings and then presented with new combinations that involved a familiar word with a new object or motion, or both. Children could map the novel word to both the object and the motion, despite the differential salience of object and motion words in their native language. A control experiment with no label confirmed that both object and motion changes were detectable.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2011	16	5					508	534		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2010.00064.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2010.00064.x								32693550					WOS:000293346400004

Infants Privilege Efficiency Over Pedagogy During Imitative Learning	INFANCY												This experiment tested how 18-month-old infants' prior experience with an object affects their imitation. Specifically, we asked whether infants would imitate an adult who used her head to illuminate a light-box if they had earlier discovered that the light could be illuminated with their hands. In the Self-Discovery condition, infants had the opportunity to freely explore the light-box; all infants used their hands to activate the light-box at least once during this period. The experimenter then entered the room and, while providing explicit pedagogical cues, demonstrated illuminating the light-box using her forehead. In the Demonstration Only condition, infants just viewed the experimenter's demonstration. During a subsequent testing phase, infants in the Demonstration Only condition were more likely to use their foreheads to activate the light-box. Conversely, infants in the Self-Discovery condition were more likely to use their hands, suggesting that efficiency can "trump" pedagogy in some observational learning contexts.

J	Reynolds, GD; Guy, MW; Zhang, DT				Reynolds, Greg D.; Guy, Maggie W.; Zhang, Dantong			Neural Correlates of Individual Differences in Infant Visual Attention and Recognition Memory	INFANCY												Past studies have identified individual differences in infant visual attention based upon peak look duration during initial exposure to a stimulus. Colombo and colleagues found that infants that demonstrate brief visual fixations (i.e., short lookers) during familiarization are more likely to demonstrate evidence of recognition memory during subsequent stimulus exposure than infants that demonstrate long visual fixations (i.e., long lookers). This study utilized event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine possible neural mechanisms associated with individual differences in visual attention and recognition memory for 6- and 7.5-month-old infants. Short- and long-looking infants viewed images of familiar and novel objects during ERP testing. There was a stimulus type by looker type interaction at temporal and frontal electrodes on the late slow wave (LSW). Short lookers demonstrated an LSW that was significantly greater in amplitude in response to novel stimulus presentations. No significant differences in LSW amplitude were found based on stimulus type for long lookers. These results indicate deeper processing and recognition memory of the familiar stimulus for short lookers.

Using a variation of the head-turn preference procedure, 5-month-old infants demonstrated that they were able to distinguish between their own South-West English accent and an unfamiliar Welsh English accent. However, this distinction was not seen when two unfamiliar accents (Welsh English and Scottish English) were presented to the infants, indicating they had not acquired the general ability to distinguish between regional varieties, but only the distinction between their home accent and unfamiliar regional variations. This ability was also confirmed with 7-month-olds, challenging recent claims that infants lose their sensitivity to dialects at around that age. Taken together, our results argue in favor of an early sensitivity to the intonation system of languages, and to the early learning of accent-specific intonation and potentially segmental patterns. Implications for the development of accent normalization abilities are discussed.

Mental Rotation of Dynamic, Three-Dimensional Stimuli by 3-Month-Old Infants	INFANCY												Mental rotation involves transforming a mental image of an object so as to accurately predict how the object would look if it were rotated in space. This study examined mental rotation in male and female 3-month-olds, using the stimuli and paradigm developed by <link rid="b14">Moore and Johnson (2008). Infants were habituated to a video of a three-dimensional object rotating back and forth through a 240 degrees angle around the vertical axis. After habituation, infants were tested both with videos of the same object rotating through the previously unseen 120 degrees angle, and with the mirror image of that display. Unlike females, who fixated the test displays for approximately equal durations, males spent significantly more time fixating the familiar object than the mirror-image object. Because familiarity preferences like this emerge when infants are relatively slow to process a habituation stimulus, the data support the interpretation that mental rotation of dynamic three-dimensional stimuli is relatively difficult-but possible-for 3-month-old males. Interpretation of the sex differences observed in 3- and 5-month-olds' performances is discussed.

In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that such social engagement is so powerful that it can sometimes lead children to overestimate what has been shared. After having shared two objects with an adult in turn, 2-year-old children played with a third object the adult could not see. In three out of four conditions, the adult remained co-present and/or communicated to the child while she played with the third object. Children falsely perceived the adult as being acquainted with the third object when she remained co-present (whether or not she also communicated) but not when she clearly terminated the interaction by disengaging and leaving. These results suggest that when young children are engaged with a co-present person they tend to overestimate the other's knowledge.

Seventy-two infants (twenty-four 6-month-olds, twenty-four 9-month-olds, twenty-four 12-month-olds) were exposed to one of two sets of high- and low-paced commercial infant DVDs. Each DVD was approximately 5-min long, and the order the DVDs were viewed was counterbalanced for pace. Attention was higher during rapidly than slowly paced DVDs, particularly for the 6- and 9-month-old infants.

Results indicated that infants' face recognition appears enhanced when faces display a happy emotional expression, suggesting the presence of a mutual interaction between face identity and emotion recognition as early as 3 months of age.

Infant Imitation From Televised Peer and Adult Models	INFANCY												Developmental changes in learning from peers and adults during the second year of life were assessed using an imitation paradigm. Independent groups of 15- and 24-month-old infants watched a prerecorded video of an unfamiliar child or adult model demonstrating a series of actions with objects. When learning was assessed immediately, 15-month-old infants imitated the target actions from the adult, but not the peer whereas 24-month-old infants imitated the target actions from both models. When infants' retention was assessed after a 10-min delay, only 24-month-old infants who had observed the peer model exhibited imitation. Across both ages, there was a significant positive correlation between the number of actions imitated from the peer and the length of regular peer exposure reported by caregivers. Length of peer exposure was not related to imitation from the adult model. Taken together, these findings indicate that a peer-model advantage develops as a function of age and experience during the second year of life.

Mother- Versus Infant-Centered Correlates of Maternal Mind-Mindedness in the First Year of Life	INFANCY												We investigated whether maternal mind-mindedness in infant-mother interaction related to aspects of obstetric history and infant temperament. Study 1, conducted with a socially diverse sample of 206 eight-month-old infants and their mothers, focused on links between maternal mind-mindedness and (i) planned conception, (ii) perception of pregnancy, and (iii) recollections of first contact with the child. The two indices of mind-mindedness (appropriate and nonattuned mind-related comments) related to different aspects of obstetric history, but no strong associations were seen with socioeconomic status, maternal depression, or perceived social support. In Study 2, we found good temporal stability in both indices of mind-mindedness in a sample of 41 infant-mother dyads between 3 and 7 months. Neither index of mind-mindedness related to infant temperament. We conclude that mind-mindedness is best characterized as a facet of the specific caregiver-child relationship, while also being influenced by stable cognitive-behavioral traits in the mother.

INFANCY												Using electrocardiogram data with 78 six-month-old infants, this study examined the presence or absence of brief orienting bradycardia during the onset of maternal arm-restraint and subsequent differences between infants on behavioral organization during restraint. Results showed that 45 of the infants exhibited brief episodes of bradycardia at the onset of arm-restraint. Group comparisons showed infants exhibiting bradycardia to have greater emotional reactivity during the arm-restraint protocol, which included a shorter latency to cry, decreased orientation toward mother, increased escape attempts during restraint, greater intensity of crying, and longer duration of crying than non-bradycardiac infants. These findings suggest that bradycardia at the outset of a mild perturbation episode may signal infants' attention to the emotional content of novel dyadic interactions and the disruption of expectancies in ongoing interactions, leading them to become distressed more quickly, turn their attention away from mom, and attempt to escape the restraint with greater vigor.

J	Kiel, EJ; Buss, KA				Kiel, Elizabeth J.; Buss, Kristin A.			Toddlers' Duration of Attention Toward Putative Threat	INFANCY												Although individual differences in reactions to novelty in the toddler years have been consistently linked to risk of developing anxious behavior, toddlers' attention toward a novel, putatively threatening stimulus while in the presence of other enjoyable activities has rarely been examined as a precursor to such risk. The current study examined how attention toward an angry-looking gorilla mask in a room with alternative opportunities for play in 24-month-old toddlers predicted social inhibition when children entered kindergarten. Analyses examined attention to threat above and beyond and in interaction with both proximity to the mask and fear of novelty observed in other situations. Attention to threat interacted with proximity to the mask to predict social inhibition, such that attention to threat most strongly predicted social inhibition when toddlers stayed furthest from the mask.

J	Bhatt, RS; Quinn, PC				Bhatt, Ramesh S.; Quinn, Paul C.			How Does Learning Impact Development in Infancy? The Case of Perceptual Organization	INFANCY												Pattern perception and organization are critical functions of the visual cognition system. Many organizational processes are available early in life, such that infants as young 3 months of age are able to readily utilize a variety of cues to organize visual patterns. However, other processes are not readily evident in young infants, and their development involves perceptual learning. We describe a theoretical framework that addresses perceptual learning in infancy and the manner in which it affects visual organization and development. It identifies five kinds of experiences that induce learning, and suggests that they work via attentional and unitization mechanisms to modify visual organization. In addition, the framework proposes that this kind of learning is abstract, domain general, functional at different ages in a qualitatively similar manner, and has a long-term impact on development through a memory reactivation process. Although most models of development assume that experience is fundamental to development, very little is actually known about the process by which experience affects development. The proposed framework is an attempt to account for this process in the domain of perception.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2011	16	1					2	38		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2010.00048.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2010.00048.x								21572570					WOS:000285206600002

Thirty premature and 30 full-term 3-month-old infants were tested in three social and nonsocial tasks of increasing complexity and their gaze behavior was micro-coded. In a one-trial version of the visual recognition paradigm, where novel stimuli were paired with familiar stimuli, preterm infants showed longer first looks to novel stimuli. In the behavior response paradigm, which presented infants with 17 stimuli of increasing complexity in a predetermined "on-off" sequence, premature infants tended to look away from toys more during presentation. Finally, during mother-infant face-to-face interaction, the most dynamic interpersonal context, preterm infants and their mothers displayed short, frequent episodes of gaze synchrony, and lag-sequential analysis indicated that both mother and infant broke moments of mutual gaze within 2 sec of its initiation. The propotion of look away during the behavior response paradigm was related to lower gaze synchrony and more gaze breaks during mother-infant interactions. Results are discussed in terms of the unique and adaptive gaze patterns typical of low-risk premature infants.

In those few studies investigating associations between infant nutrition and attachment, nutrition was defined solely by physical growth, and infants had moderate-severe growth retardation. In this study, we utilized multiple markers of infant nutrition. Our sample consisted of 172 12-month-old Peruvian infants and their mothers from low-income families, with a follow-up assessment on 77 infants at 18 months. Infants were not severely malnourished, but did have micronutrient deficiencies. Anthropometry, dietary intake, and iron status were used as measures of infant nutrition. Based on infant behavior in a structured laboratory situation, Q-sort techniques were used to rate three attachment markers: infant secure base behavior, interaction quality, and negative emotionality with mother. At 12 months, infant weight was positively related to interaction quality. At 18 months, infant iron status was positively related to secure base behavior. This pattern of findings remained even after statistically controlling for family socioeconomic status and maternal education. Our findings indicate that infant nutritional status is associated with markers of infant attachment and these associations are not restricted just to severely malnourished infants.

Phonotactic Constraints on Infant Word Learning	INFANCY												How do infants use their knowledge of native language sound patterns when learning words? There is ample evidence of infants' precocious acquisition of native language sound structure during the first year of life, but much less evidence concerning how they apply this knowledge to the task of associating sounds with meanings in word learning. To address this question, 18-month-olds were presented with two phonotactically legal object labels (containing sound sequences that occur frequently in English) or two phonotactically illegal object labels (containing sound sequences that never occur in English), paired with novel objects. Infants were then tested using a looking-while-listening measure. The results revealed that infants looked at the correct objects after hearing the legal labels, but not the illegal labels. Furthermore, vocabulary size was related to performance. Infants with larger receptive vocabularies displayed greater differences between learning of legal and illegal labels than infants with smaller vocabularies. These findings provide evidence that infants' knowledge of native language sound patterns influences their word learning.

Picture Perception in Infants: Generalization From Two-Dimensional to Three-Dimensional Displays	INFANCY												Two experiments investigated 9-month-old infants' abilities to recognize the correspondence between an actual three-dimensional (3D) object and its two-dimensional (2D) representation, looking specifically at representations that did not literally depict the actual object: schematic line drawings. In Experiment 1, infants habituated to a line drawing of either a doll or a sheep and were then tested with the actual objects themselves. Infants habituated to the sheep drawing recovered to the unfamiliar but not the familiar object, showing a novelty preference. Infants habituated to the doll drawing, however, recovered to both familiar and unfamiliar objects, failing to show any preference between the two. In Experiment 2, infants habituated to the 3D objects and were then tested with the 2D line drawings. In this case, both groups of infants showed a preference only for the novel displays. Together these findings demonstrate that 9-month-old infants recognize the correspondence between 3D objects and their 2D representations, even when these representations are not literal copies of the objects themselves.

In this study, we examined the ability of 18- and 24-month-old infants to engage in three types of other-oriented behaviors, specifically helping, sharing, and comforting. Infants in both age groups engaged in more prosocial behavior on trials in which an unfamiliar adult experimenter required aid (experimental conditions) than on those in which she did not (control conditions) across two of the three prosocial tasks (i.e., helping and sharing). The infants engaged in these behaviors with similar frequency; however, there was no correlation between the tasks. The implications for the construct of prosocial behavior and the presence of a prosocial disposition are discussed.

Toddler Emotion Regulation With Mothers and Fathers: Temporal Associations Between Negative Affect and Behavioral Strategies	INFANCY												The present study investigated temporal associations between putative emotion regulation strategies and negative affect in 20-month-old toddlers. Toddlers' parent-focused, self-distraction, and toy-focused strategies, as well as negative affect, were rated on a second-by-second basis during laboratory parent-toddler interactions. Longitudinal mixed-effects models were conducted to determine the degree to which behavioral strategy use predicts subsequent negative affect and negative affect predicts subsequent strategy use. Results with mother-toddler and father-toddler dyads indicated that parent-focused strategies with an unresponsive parent were followed by increases in negative affect, whereas toy-focused strategies were followed by decreases in negative affect. Results also indicated that toddler negative affect serves to regulate behavioral strategy use within both parent contexts.

In the first 6 months of life, infants can discriminate among individual human and monkey faces. Though the ability to discriminate monkey faces is lost after about 9 months, infants retain human face discrimination, presumably because of their experience with human faces. The current study demonstrates that 4- to 6-month-old infants are able to discriminate nonprimate faces as well. In a visual paired comparison test, 4- to 6-month-old infants (n = 26) looked significantly longer at novel sheep (Ovis aries) faces, compared to a familiar sheep face (p = .017), while 9- to 11-month-olds (n = 26) showed no visual preference, and adults (n = 27) had a familiarity preference (p < .001). Infants' face recognition systems are broadly tuned at birth-not just for primate faces, but for nonprimate faces as well-allowing infants to become specialists in recognizing the types of faces encountered in their first year of life.

The Biological Implausibility of the Nature-Nurture Dichotomy and What It Means for the Study of Infancy	INFANCY												Since the time of the Greeks, philosophers and scientists have wondered about the origins of structure and function. Plato proposed that the origins of structure and function lie in the organism's nature whereas Aristotle proposed that they lie in its nurture. This nature-nurture dichotomy and the emphasis on the origins question has had a powerful effect on our thinking about development right into modern times. Despite this, empirical findings from various branches of developmental science have made a compelling case that the nature-nurture dichotomy is biologically implausible and, thus, that a search for developmental origins must be replaced by research into developmental processes. This change in focus recognizes that development is an immensely complex, dynamic, embedded, interdependent, and probabilistic process and, therefore, renders simplistic questions such as whether a particular behavioral capacity is innate or acquired scientifically uninteresting.

The main objective of this study was to obtain a maximum likelihood estimate of the proportion of toddlers in the general population who are reported to exhibit ODBs on a frequent basis, and to test for gender differences therein. Data came from The Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development, a survey of a representative birth cohort of children from the Canadian province of Quebec. Multigroup latent class analysis was used to distinguish between toddlers who exhibit ODBs on a frequent basis and those who do so only occasionally or not at all. The results show that 12.4% of 17-month-old boys and girls exhibit ODBs on a frequent basis. Further, the results show a strong positive association between opposition-defiance and physical aggression early in life, with a great majority of physically aggressive toddlers exhibiting ODBs on a frequent basis. In contrast, the results show that only a minority of toddlers who may be experiencing a significant opposition-defiance problem exhibit physically aggressive behaviors on a frequent basis.

Infants' and toddlers' reactions to peers' attempts to take their toys were assessed in three independent data sets in which the same observational coding system had been used (N = 200). To ensure that infants' use of force was goal-directed and not a simple physical reaction, we recorded infants' reactions when peers picked up toys that the focal infants had just put down, or were nearby or in the focal infants' mothers' laps. The use of force in response to peers' taking over toys was evident before the first birthday, but more common thereafter, although only a minority of children in each sample used force. Analysis of a combined data set revealed that force was deployed more often by 2-year-olds than younger infants, and was significantly associated with verbal references to people's possession of objects. These observations show that toddlers do deploy force intentionally to defend their possessions.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2011	16	5					471	489		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00069.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2011.00069.x								32693554					WOS:000293346400002

Attention to Multiple Cues During Spontaneous Object Labeling	INFANCY												It is well established that 2-year-olds attribute a novel label to an object's global shape rather than local features (i.e., parts). Although recent studies have found that younger infants also attend to global rather than local features when given a label, the test stimuli in these experiments confounded parts and shape by varying both or neither. With infants (16- and 24-month-olds) and adults, this experiment disentangled shape and parts with appropriate test objects. Results showed a clear development of a strategy incorporating multiple cues. Across three age groups, there was an increase in generalizing labels to objects matching the exemplar's local and global features (parts, base, and shape), and a decrease to objects matching in only one local feature. We discuss these results in terms of a learned flexibility in using multiple cues to predict lexical categories.

Auditory Stream Segregation Improves Infants' Selective Attention to Target Tones Amid Distracters	INFANCY												This study examined the role of auditory stream segregation in the selective attention to target tones in infancy. Using a task adapted from Bregman and Rudnicky's 1975 study and implemented in a conditioned head-turn procedure, infant and adult listeners had to discriminate the temporal order of 2,200 and 2,400 Hz target tones presented alone, preceded and followed by 1,460 Hz flanker tones, and presented within a series of 1,460 Hz captor tones meant to release the target tones from the effects of the flankers by capturing the flankers into a separate stream. Infants showed the same pattern of discrimination across conditions as adults: discrimination of target tones in the target-alone condition, a decrease in performance when flanker tones were introduced, and a return to target-alone level in the captor condition. These results suggest that infants' perceptual organization of tones is similar to that of adults, and that their ability to selectively attend to target sounds and ignore distracters depends on the structural properties and perceptual organization of the nontarget sounds.

In the first experiment, infants viewed a display in which texture gradients, linear perspective of the surface contours, and relative height in the visual field provided information that two objects were at different distances. Five- and 7-month-old infants reached preferentially for the apparently nearer object under monocular but not binocular viewing conditions, indicating that infants in both age groups respond to pictorial depth cues. In the second experiment, texture gradients and linear perspective of the surface contours were eliminated from the experimental display, making relative height the sole pictorial depth cue. Seven-month-olds again reached more often for the apparently nearer object under monocular, but not binocular viewing conditions. By contrast, the 5-month-olds' reaching behavior did not differ between viewing conditions. These results indicate that 7-month-olds respond to the depth cue of relative height but provide no evidence of responsiveness to relative height in 5-month-olds. Both age groups responded more consistently to pictorial depth in Experiment 1 than in Experiment 2.

J	Schwarzer, G; Jovanovic, B				Schwarzer, Gudrun; Jovanovic, Bianca			The Relationship Between Processing Facial Identity and Emotional Expression in 8-Month-Old Infants	INFANCY												In Experiment 1, it was investigated whether infants process facial identity and emotional expression independently or in conjunction with one another. Eight-month-old infants were habituated to two upright or two inverted faces varying in facial identity and emotional expression. Infants were tested with a habituation face, a switch face, and a novel face. In the switch faces, a new combination of identity and emotional expression was presented. The results show that infants differentiated between switch and habituation faces only in the upright condition but not in the inverted condition. Experiment 2 provides evidence that infants' nonresponse in the inverted condition can be attributed to their independent processing of facial identity and emotional expression. This suggests that infants in the upright condition processed facial identity and emotional expression in conjunction with one another.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2010	15	1					28	45		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2009.00004.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2009.00004.x								32693458					WOS:000274439400003
J	Lewkowicz, DJ; Leo, I; Simion, F				Lewkowicz, David J.; Leo, Irene; Simion, Francesca			Intersensory Perception at Birth: Newborns Match Nonhuman Primate Faces and Voices	INFANCY												Previous studies have shown that infants, including newborns, can match previously unseen and unheard human faces and vocalizations. More recently, it has been reported that infants as young as 4 months of age also can match the faces and vocalizations of other species raising the possibility that such broad multisensory perceptual tuning is present at birth. To test this possiblity, we investigated whether newborns can match monkey facial and vocal gestures. Using a paired preference procedure, in Experiment 1 we presented pairs of different visible monkey calls in silence and then in the presence of one or the other corresponding audible call and compared preferences across the silent and in-sound conditions. In Experiment 2, we presented the same monkey visible calls but this time together with a tone analog of the natural calls in the in-sound trials. We found that newborns looked longer at the matching visible call in the in-sound condition than in the silent condition in both experiments. These findings indicate that multisensory perceptual tuning is so broad at birth that it enables newborns to integrate the facial and vocal gestures of other primates and that integration is based on newborns' detection of audio-visual temporal synchrony relations.					; simion, francesca/D-6175-2015	Lewkowicz, David/0000-0001-6685-3178; simion, francesca/0000-0002-0101-9753; LEO, IRENE/0000-0002-4925-4373													1525-0008						2010	15	1					46	60		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2009.00005.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2009.00005.x								32693457					WOS:000274439400004
J	Jaime, M; Bahrick, L; Lickliter, R				Jaime, Mark; Bahrick, Lorraine; Lickliter, Robert			The Critical Role of Temporal Synchrony in the Salience of Intersensory Redundancy During Prenatal Development	INFANCY												We explored the amount and timing of temporal synchrony necessary to facilitate prenatal perceptual learning using an animal model, the bobwhite quail. Quail embryos were exposed to various audiovisual combinations of a bobwhite maternal call paired with patterned light during the late stages of prenatal development and were tested postnatally for evidence of prenatal auditory learning of the familiarized call. Results revealed that a maternal call paired with a single pulse of light synchronized with one note of the five note call was sufficient to facilitate embryos' prenatal perceptual learning of the entire call. A synchronous note occurring at the onset of the call burst was most effective at facilitating learning. These findings highlight quail embryos' remarkable sensitivity to temporal synchrony and indicate its role in promoting learning of redundantly specified stimulus properties during prenatal development.

We report that 6-month-old infants can differentiate leftward and rightward motions from a movie depicting the sagittal view of an upright human point-light walker, walking as if on a treadmill. Inversion of the stimuli resulted in no detection of directionality. These findings suggest that biological motion displays convey information for young infants beyond that which distinguishes them from nonbiological motion; aspects of the action itself are also detected. The potential visual mechanisms underlying biological motion detection, as well as the behavioral interpretations of point-light figures, are discussed.

As the outcome of the two tasks is the same (i.e., the toy is not shared), the infants must respond to the different goals of the actor. However, visual habituation paradigms have shown an earlier onset of goal awareness. The present study reconciles this disparity by replicating the findings of Behne et al. with both 6- and 9-month-olds, using similar tasks and additional response measures.																			1525-0008						2010	15	1					94	106		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2009.00002.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2009.00002.x								32693455					WOS:000274439400007

What Habituates in Infant Visual Habituation? A Psychophysiological Analysis	INFANCY												Despite the use of visual habituation over the past half century, relatively little is known about its underlying processes. We analyzed heart rate (HR) taken simultaneous with looking during infant-controlled habituation sessions collected longitudinally at 4, 6, and 8 months of age with the goal of examining how HR and HR-defined phases of attention change across habituation. There were four major findings. First, the depth and topography of decelerations and proportion of sustained attention (SA) did not vary across habituation at any age, which suggested (in contrast to the tenets of comparator theory) the persistence of substantial cognitive activity at the end of visual habituation. Second, attention termination (AT) robustly declined across trials, suggesting that, contrary to prior thinking, AT might be a sensitive indicant of visual learning. Third, infants at all ages showed an HR increase (startle) to stimulus onset on the first trial, the magnitude of which was associated with subsequent delayed HR deceleration and less SA; thus, stimulus events affect processing during trials. Finally, mean overall HR reliably increased across trials for all ages. This last finding implies the need to distinguish between "phasic" HR changes (e.g., decelerations during looks) and longer term "tonic" HR changes (mean increases across trials) during habituation, and raises the question of what processes the tonic increases might reflect within the habituation paradigm.

J	Houston-Price, C; Caloghiris, Z; Raviglione, E				Houston-Price, Carmel; Caloghiris, Zoe; Raviglione, Eleonora			Language Experience Shapes the Development of the Mutual Exclusivity Bias	INFANCY												Halberda (2003) demonstrated that 17-month-old infants, but not 14- or 16-month-olds, use a strategy known as mutual exclusivity (ME) to identify the meanings of new words. When 17-month-olds were presented with a novel word in an intermodal preferential looking task, they preferentially fixated a novel object over an object for which they already had a name. We explored whether the development of this word-learning strategy is driven by children's experience of hearing only one name for each referent in their environment by comparing the behavior of infants from monolingual and bilingual homes. Monolingual infants aged 17-22 months showed clear evidence of using an ME strategy, in that they preferentially fixated the novel object when they were asked to "look at the dax." Bilingual infants of the same age and vocabulary size failed to show a similar pattern of behavior. We suggest that children who are raised with more than one language fail to develop an ME strategy in parallel with monolingual infants because development of the bias is a consequence of the monolingual child's everyday experiences with words.

Role of Father Involvement	INFANCY												Prior research showed that 5- to 13-month-old infants of chronically depressed mothers did not learn to associate a segment of infant-directed speech produced by their own mothers or an unfamiliar nondepressed mother with a smiling female face, but showed better-than-normal learning when a segment of infant-directed speech produced by an unfamiliar nondepressed father signaled the face. Here, learning in response to an unfamiliar nondepressed father's infant-directed speech was studied as a function both of the mother's depression and marital status, a proxy measure of father involvement. Infants of unmarried mothers on average did not show significant learning in response to the unfamiliar nondepressed father's infant-directed speech. Infants of married mothers showed significant learning in response to male infant-directed speech, and infants of depressed, married mothers showed significantly stronger learning in response to that stimulus than did infants of nondepressed, married mothers. Several ways in which father involvement may positively or negatively affect infant responsiveness to male infant-directed speech are discussed.

We had two questions. First, extending the method of Barr, Zack, Garcia, and Muentener (Infancy, 13 [2008], 30-56) to a younger population, we asked if age, prior exposure, and caregiver verbal input would predict infant looking to a Baby Mozart video from 6 to 18 months. Second, we asked if caregiver-infant interactional quality, defined as the amount of shared focus and turn taking between infant and caregiver, would be associated with infant looking time. We found that, in addition to the anticipated effect of prior exposure and caregiver verbal input, interactional quality measures were related to infant media-directed looking. Infants who engaged in more shared focus and turn taking looked more to the program than infants who interacted less with their caregivers. These results are discussed in terms of social mediation of coviewing during early infancy.

Mothers reported on the conditions of childbirth when infants were 6-8 months of age, and their interactive behavior was observed during a home visit at 12 months. Results showed that mothers who did not report health problems during pregnancy and who had longer pregnancies, shorter hospital stays, natural deliveries, and infants with greater birthweight were found to be more sensitive during interactions with infants at 12 months. All these relations held after accounting for socio-economic factors and maternal psychological distress, except for the effect of type of delivery. This pattern of results, however, was almost exclusively due to mothers who already had at least one other child. Very few such relations were found among primiparous mothers.

One group consisted of children abandoned at birth who were randomly assigned to Care-as-Usual (institutional care) following a baseline assessment. Another group consisted of children abandoned at birth who were randomly assigned to high-quality foster care following a baseline assessment. A third group consisted of never-institutionalized children who were reared by their biological parents. All children were familiarized to happy, sad, fearful, and neutral facial expressions and tested on their ability to discriminate familiar versus novel facial expressions. Contrary to our prediction, all three groups of children were equally capable of discriminating among the different expressions. Furthermore, in contrast to findings at 13-30 months of age, these same children showed familiarity rather than novelty preferences toward different expressions. There were also asymmetries in children's discrimination of facial expressions depending on which facial expression served as the familiar versus novel stimulus. Collectively, early institutionalization appears not to impact the development of the ability to discriminate facial expressions of emotion, at least when preferential looking serves as the dependent measure. These findings are discussed in the context of the myriad domains that are affected by early institutionalization.					nelson, charles/LBH-6397-2024; Zeanah, Charles/AAO-3756-2020	Zeanah, Charles/0000-0002-7004-6819; Nelson, Charles/0000-0002-4723-247X													1525-0008	1532-7078					2010	15	2					209	221		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2009.00007.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2009.00007.x								25530725					WOS:000275206100006
J	Pons, F; Bosch, L				Pons, Ferran; Bosch, Laura			Stress Pattern Preference in Spanish-Learning Infants: The Role of Syllable Weight	INFANCY												As a result of exposure, infants acquire biases that conform to the rhythmic properties of their native language. Previous lexical stress preference studies have shown that English- and German-, but not French-learning infants, show a bias toward trochaic words. The present study explores Spanish-learning infants' lexical stress preferential patterns and the role of syllable weight at 9 months of age. Spanish is a syllable-timed language with no vowel reduction and variable stress. Around 50% of the word types in Spanish are disyllabic, with a superior proportion of trochees than iambs (60% and 40%, respectively). Experiment 1 with CV.CV pseudo-words failed to reveal a clear trochaic bias in 9-month-old Spanish-learning infants. However, when preference was explored with items containing a heavy syllable (CVC.CV and CV.CVC, respectively), both a trochaic (Experiment 2) and an iambic preference (Experiment 3) could be elicited. These results suggest that knowledge about the close and highly regular link between heavy syllables and stress assignment in Spanish can be easily acquired and determines infants' preference at 9 months of age, while for CV.CV items, the trochaic bias appears to be weak. Our results broaden the current knowledge on the factors that determine the emergence of rhythmic biases.

Anger and Approach Motivation in Infancy: Relations to Early Childhood Inhibitory Control and Behavior Problems	INFANCY												The relations among infant anger reactivity, approach behavior, and frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) asymmetry, and their relations to inhibitory control and behavior problems in early childhood were examined within the context of a longitudinal study of temperament. Two hundred nine infants' anger expressions to arm restraint were observed at 4 months of age. Infants' approach behaviors during play with an unpredictable toy and baseline frontal EEG asymmetry were assessed at 9 months of age. Inhibitory control during a Go/No-Go task and parent report of behavior problems were evaluated at 4 years of age. High anger-prone infants with left, but not right, frontal EEG asymmetry showed significantly more approach behaviors and less inhibitory control relative to less anger-prone infants. Although a link between anger proneness in infancy and behavior problems in early childhood was not found, a combination of low approach behaviors and poor inhibitory control was predictive of internalizing behaviors.

Neural Correlates of Encoding Predict Infants' Memory in the Paired-Comparison Procedure	INFANCY												The present study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to monitor infant brain activity during the initial encoding of a previously novel visual stimulus, and examined whether ERP measures of encoding predicted infants' subsequent performance on a visual memory task (i.e., the paired-comparison task). A late slow wave component of the ERP measured at encoding predicted infants' immediate performance in the paired-comparison task: amplitude of the late slow wave at right-central and temporal leads decreased with stimulus repetition, and greater decreases at right-anterior-temporal leads during encoding were associated with better memory performance at test. By contrast, neither the amplitude nor latency of the negative central (Nc) component predicted infants' subsequent performance in the paired-comparison task.

Sixty-one mother-child dyads (36 girls) participated in testing phases at 12 (T1), 15 (T2), and 26 months of age (T3), allowing for assessment of maternal mind-mindedness (T1), infant attachment (T2), and child ToM understanding (T3). Results indicated that children's understanding of discrepant desires and visual perspectives was positively related to their mothers' earlier use of appropriate mind-related comments in certain contexts. Furthermore, more securely attached boys, but not girls, performed better on a task requiring comprehension of their mothers' visual perspective. Hence, the links previously found between competent parenting and older children's ToM performance appear to extend, to a certain degree, to toddlers' first manifestations of ToM understanding.

Four objects were presented serially. For two objects, infants played with an experimenter. The infant played with one object alone, and the experimenter played with one object alone. Finally, all four objects were presented together, and the experimenter excitedly asked for one without indicating which. Results showed that younger infants tended to chose the object that they had not yet played with, whereas older infants were significantly more likely to choose the object that the experimenter had not yet played with. These results are discussed in the context of research on the development of understanding diversity of simple object-directed attitudes in the second year of life.

J	Kenward, B				Kenward, Ben			10-Month-Olds Visually Anticipate an Outcome Contingent on Their Own Action	INFANCY												It is known that young infants can learn to perform an action that elicits a reinforcer, and that they can visually anticipate a predictable stimulus by looking at its location before it begins. Here, in an investigation of the display of these abilities in tandem, I report that 10-month-olds anticipate a reward stimulus that they generate through their own action: .5 sec before pushing a button to start a video reward, they increase their rate of gaze shifts to the reward location; and during periods of extinction, reward location gaze shifts correlate with bouts of button pushing. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the infants have an expectation of the outcome of their actions: several alternative hypotheses are ruled out by yoked controls. Such an expectation may, however, be procedural, have minimal content, and is not necessarily sufficient to motivate action.

Experiment 1 tested 12-month-old infants' perceptual learning of objects that elicited ODVs. Fourteen infants' vocalizations were recorded as they explored novel objects. Infants learned visual features of objects that elicited the most ODVs but not of objects that elicited the fewest vocalizations. Experiment 2 assessed the role of ODVs in learning word-object associations. Forty infants aged 11.5 months played with a novel object and received a label either contingently on an ODV or on a look alone. Only infants who received labels in response to an ODV learned the association. Taken together, the findings suggest that infants' ODVs signal a state of attention that facilitates learning.

J	Luo, YY				Luo, Yuyan			Do 8-Month-Old Infants Consider Situational Constraints When Interpreting Others' Gaze as Goal-Directed Action?	INFANCY												Some actions of agents are ambiguous in terms of goal-directedness to young infants. If given reasons why an agent performed these ambiguous actions, would infants then be able to perceive the actions as goal-directed? Prior results show that infants younger than 12 months can not encode the relationship between a human agent's looking behavior and the target of her gaze as goal-directed. In the present experiments, 8-month-olds responded in ways suggesting that they interpreted an agent's action of looking at object-A as opposed to object-B as evidence for her goal directed toward object-A, if her looking action was rational given certain situational constraints: a barrier separated her from the objects or her hands were occupied. Therefore, the infants seem to consider situational constraints when attributing goals to agents' otherwise ambiguous actions; they seem to realize that within such constraints, these actions are efficient ways for agents to achieve goals.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2010	15	4					392	419		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2009.00019.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2009.00019.x								32693520					WOS:000278308800003

Distributional Phonetic Learning at 10 Months of Age	INFANCY												Infant phonetic perception reorganizes in accordance with the native language by 10 months of age. One mechanism that may underlie this perceptual change is distributional learning, a statistical analysis of the distributional frequency of speech sounds. Previous distributional learning studies have tested infants of 6-8 months, an age at which native phonetic categories have not yet developed. Here, three experiments test infants of 10 months to help illuminate perceptual ability following perceptual reorganization. English-learning infants did not change discrimination in response to nonnative speech sound distributions from either a voicing distinction (Experiment 1) or a place-of-articulation distinction (Experiment 2). In Experiment 3, familiarization to the place-of-articulation distinction was doubled to increase the amount of exposure, and in this case infants began discriminating the sounds. These results extend the processes of distributional learning to a new phonetic contrast, and reveal that at 10 months of age, distributional phonetic learning remains effective, but is more difficult than before perceptual reorganization.					; Pons, Ferran/A-1156-2013	Werker, Janet F./0000-0002-1168-9013; Pons, Ferran/0000-0001-5919-8590													1525-0008	1532-7078					2010	15	4					420	433		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2009.00024.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2009.00024.x								32693519					WOS:000278308800004

INFANCY												Recent studies suggest that even infants attend to others' beliefs in order to make sense of their behavior. To warrant the assumption of early belief understanding, corresponding competences need to be demonstrated in a variety of different belief-inducing situations. The present study provides corresponding evidence, using a completely nonverbal object-transfer task based on the general violation-of-expectation paradigm. A total of n = 36 infants (15-month-olds) participated in one of three conditions. Infants saw an actor who either observed an object's location change, did not observe it, or performed the location change manually without seeing it (i.e., variations in the actor's information access). Results are in accordance with the assumption that 15-month-old infants master different belief-inducing situations in a highly flexible way, accepting visual as well as manual information access as a proper basis for belief induction.

J	Mani, N; Plunkett, K				Mani, Nivedita; Plunkett, Kim			Twelve-Month-Olds Know Their <i>Cups</i> From Their <i>Keps</i> and <i>Tups</i>	INFANCY												Fourteen-month-olds are sensitive to mispronunciations of the vowels and consonants in familiar words (N. Mani & K. Plunkett (2007), Journal of Memory and Language, 57, 252; D. Swingley & R. N. Aslin (2002), Psychological Science, 13, 480). To examine the development of this sensitivity further, the current study tests 12-month-olds' sensitivity to different kinds of vowel and consonant mispronunciations of familiar words. The results reveal that vocalic changes influence word recognition, irrespective of the kinds of vocalic changes made. While consonant changes influenced word recognition in a similar manner, this was restricted to place and manner of articulation changes. Infants did not display sensitivity to voicing changes. Infants' sensitivity to vowel mispronunciations, but not consonant mispronunciations, was influenced by their vocabulary size-infants with larger vocabularies were more sensitive to vowel mispronunciations than infants with smaller vocabularies. The results are discussed in terms of different models attempting to chart the development of acoustically or phonologically specified representations of words during infancy.

Computational Modeling of Statistical Learning: Effects of Transitional Probability Versus Frequency and Links to Word Learning	INFANCY												Statistical learning mechanisms play an important role in theories of language acquisition and processing. Recurrent neural network models have provided important insights into how these mechanisms might operate. We examined whether such networks capture two key findings in human statistical learning. In Simulation 1, a simple recurrent network (SRN) performed much like human learners: it was sensitive to both transitional probability and frequency, with frequency dominating early in learning and probability emerging as the dominant cue later in learning. In Simulation 2, an SRN captured links between statistical segmentation and word learning in infants and adults, and suggested that these links arise because phonological representations are more distinctive for syllables with higher transitional probability. Beyond simply simulating general phenomena, these models provide new insights into underlying mechanisms and generate novel behavioral predictions.

We used high-density event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine whether young infants represent these distinct types of information about previously experienced items. Twenty-four different highly familiar and initially novel items were each repeated exactly once either immediately (Experiment 1), or following one intervening item (Experiment 2). A late slow wave (LSW) component of the ERP exhibited neural responses consistent with recency signals over right-central leads, but only when there were no intervening stimuli between repetitions. The LSW also exhibited responses consistent with familiarity signals over anterior-temporal leads, but only when there were intervening stimuli between repetitions. A mid-latency negative component (i.e., the Nc) also distinguished familiar from novel items, but did not exhibit a pattern of responding consistent with familiarity signals. These findings suggest that infants encode information about a variety of objects from their natural environments into long-term memory, and can discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar items, and between recently seen and new items, very quickly (within 1 sec). They also suggest that infants represent information about not only whether a stimulus is familiar or unfamiliar but also whether it has been seen recently.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2010	15	5					487	516		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2009.00021.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2009.00021.x								32693510					WOS:000280458000003
J	Shi, RS; Melançon, A				Shi, Rushen; Melancon, Andreane			Syntactic Categorization in French-Learning Infants	INFANCY												Recent work showed that infants recognize and store function words starting from the age of 6-8 months. Using a visual fixation procedure, the present study tested whether French-learning 14-month-olds have the knowledge of syntactic categories of determiners and pronouns, respectively, and whether they can use these function words for categorizing novel words to nouns and verbs. The prosodic characteristics of novel words stimuli for noun versus verb uses were balanced. The only distinguishing cue was the preceding determiners versus subject pronouns, the former being the most common for nouns and the latter the most common for verbs, i.e., Det + Noun, Pron + Verb. We expected that noun categorization may be easier than verb categorization because the co-occurrence of determiners with nouns is more consistent than that of subject pronouns with verbs in French. The results showed that infants grouped the individual determiners as one common class, and that they appeared to use the determiners to categorize novel words into nouns. However, we found no evidence of verb categorization. Unlike determiners, pronouns were not perceived as a common syntactic class.

However, research suggests that infants do not develop body representation (i.e., knowledge about typical human bodies) until the second year of life, although they are sensitive to facial information much earlier. Yet, previous research only examined whether infants are sensitive to the typical arrangement of body parts. We examined whether younger infants have body knowledge of a different kind, namely the relative size of body parts. Five- and 9-month-old infants were tested for their preference between a normal versus a proportionally distorted body. Nine-month-olds exhibited a preference for the normal body when images were presented upright but not when they were inverted. Five-month-olds failed to exhibit a preference in either condition. These results indicate that infants have knowledge about human bodies by the second half of the first year of life. Moreover, given that better performance on upright than on inverted stimuli has been tied to expertise, the fact that older infants exhibited an inversion effect with body images indicates that at least some level of expertise in body processing develops by 9 months of age.

After sharing a particular type of referent with an adult in an excited manner, 18-month-olds subsequently found a picture of that type of referent more worthy of declarative pointing than some other picture-but only for that adult, not for a different adult. Mixed results were found with 14-month-olds. We thus show that by 18 months, infants accurately track their shared experiences with specific individuals and use this to make communicative decisions. These results also demonstrate that infants sometimes use declarative pointing to indicate not totally "new" things, as in the classic formulation, but things which are "old" in the sense that "we" should recognize them as similar to something we have previously shared.

The aim was to examine whether mother-infant coregulation changes over the second year of the infant's life and whether there are individual differences in that process. Normative trends as well as variability between and within dyads were tested using a multilevel modeling technique. We found that unilateral coregulation, in which only the mother was actively involved in play, largely prevailed at the beginning of the year and then decreased linearly, while symmetrical patterns, implying that the infant was also involved, were for the most part absent at the beginning but then increased rapidly, overtaking unilateral from the middle of the year on and becoming predominant by the end. In particular, symmetrical episodes of shared affect and shared action increased first and then decreased, being replaced by shared language. Variability in data was significant between the dyads, with some dyads advancing toward symmetrical coregulation at an earlier age and more rapidly than the others. It was also significant within the dyads, as the increase in symmetrical coregulation unfolded in a quite irregular manner across the sessions, unlike the decrease in unilateral. Results are discussed with reference to a view of joint attention development as a gradual and complex process.

Infant Symbolic Play as an Early Indicator of Fetal Alcohol-Related Deficit	INFANCY												Infant symbolic play was examined in relation to prenatal alcohol exposure and socioenvironmental background and to predict which infants met criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) at 5 years. A total of 107 Cape-Colored, South African infants born to heavy drinking mothers and abstainers/light drinkers were recruited prenatally. Complexity of play, sociodemographic and psychological correlates of maternal alcohol use, and quality of parenting were assessed at 13 months, and intelligence quotient and FAS diagnosis at 5 years. The effect of drinking on spontaneous play was not significant after control for social environment. In contrast, prenatal alcohol and quality of parenting related independently to elicited play. Elicited play predicted 5-year Digit Span and was poorer in infants subsequently diagnosed with FAS/partial FAS and in nonsyndromal heavily exposed infants, compared with abstainers/light drinkers. Thus, symbolic play may provide an early indicator of risk for alcohol-related deficits. The independent effects of prenatal alcohol and quality of parenting suggest that infants whose symbolic play is adversely affected by alcohol exposure may benefit from stimulation from a responsive caregiver.

J	Rost, GC; McMurray, B				Rost, Gwyneth C.; McMurray, Bob			Finding the Signal by Adding Noise: The Role of Noncontrastive Phonetic Variability in Early Word Learning	INFANCY												It is well attested that 14-month-olds have difficulty learning similar sounding words (e.g., bih/dih), despite their excellent phonetic discrimination abilities. By contrast, Rost and McMurray (2009) recently demonstrated that 14-month-olds' minimal-pair learning can be improved by the presentation of words by multiple talkers. This study investigates which components of the variability found in multitalker input improved infants' processing, assessing both the phonologically contrastive aspects of the speech stream and phonologically irrelevant indexical and suprasegmental aspects. In the first two experiments, speaker was held constant while cues to word-initial voicing were systematically manipulated. Infants failed in both cases. The third experiment introduced variability in speaker, but voicing cues were invariant within each category. Infants in this condition learned the words. We conclude that aspects of the speech signal that have been typically thought of as noise are in fact valuable information-signal-for the young word learner.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2010	15	6					608	635		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2010.00033.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2010.00033.x								24358016					WOS:000282511700003

Infants' Response to Pictures of Impossible Objects	INFANCY												Previous work has shown that 4-month-olds can discriminate between two-dimensional (2D) depictions of structurally possible and impossible objects [S. M. Shuwairi (2009), Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 104, 115; S. M. Shuwairi, M. K. Albert, & S. P. Johnson (2007), Psychological Science, 18, 303]. Here, we asked whether evidence of discrimination of possible and impossible pictures would also be revealed in infants' patterns of reaching and manual exploration. Nine-month-old infants were presented with realistic photograph displays of structurally possible and impossible cubes along with a series of perceptual controls, and engaged in more frequent manual exploration of pictures of impossible objects. In addition, the impossible cube display elicited significantly more social referencing and vocalizations than the possible cube and perceptual control displays. The increased manual gestures associated with the incoherent figure suggest that perceptual and manual action mechanisms are interrelated in early development. The infant's visual system extracts structural information contained in 2D images in analyzing the projected 3D configuration, and this information serves to control both the oculomotor and manual action systems.																			1525-0008						2010	15	6					636	649		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2009.00029.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2009.00029.x								32693461					WOS:000282511700004

Developmental Changes in Infants' Ability to Cope with Dialect Variation in Word Recognition	INFANCY												Toward the end of their first year of life, infants' overly specified word representations are thought to give way to more abstract ones, which helps them to better cope with variation not relevant to word identity (e.g., voice and affect). This developmental change may help infants process the ambient language more efficiently, thus enabling rapid gains in vocabulary growth. One particular kind of variability that infants must accommodate is that of dialectal accent, because most children will encounter speakers from different regions and backgrounds. In this study, we explored developmental changes in infants' ability to recognize words in continuous speech by familiarizing them with words spoken by a speaker of their own region (North Midland-American English) or a different region (Southern Ontario Canadian English), and testing them with passages spoken by a speaker of the opposite dialectal accent. Our results demonstrate that 12- but not 9-month-olds readily recognize words in the face of dialectal variation.

Abstract Rule Learning for Visual Sequences in 8-and 11-Month-Olds	INFANCY												The experiments reported here investigated the development of a fundamental component of cognition: to recognize and generalize abstract relations. Infants were presented with simple rule-governed patterned sequences of visual shapes (ABB, AAB, and ABA) that could be discriminated from differences in the position of the repeated element (late, early, or nonadjacent, respectively). Eight-month-olds were found to distinguish patterns on the basis of the repetition, but appeared insensitive to its position in the sequence; 11-month-olds distinguished patterns over the position of the repetition, but appeared insensitive to the nonadjacent repetition. These results suggest that abstract pattern detection may develop incrementally in a process of constructing complex relations from more primitive components.

Development of Vocal Protests From 3 to 18 Months	INFANCY												Infants often protest the activities of their caregivers, and this particular social interaction may provide an important window on early communication and its development. This study used naturalistic methods to investigate the development of vocal protests. Fifteen mother-infant dyads at each of 5 ages, from 3 to 18 months, were observed at home. Maternal behaviors of caregiving and prohibiting were tallied from videotapes, as were infants' protests of these behaviors. Maternal caregiving decreased with age, but maternal prohibitions increased. There were no changes over age in the probability of protesting maternal caregiving behavior; however, 12-month-olds were more likely to protest prohibitions than 6- or 8-month-olds. Older infants were also more likely to use intense protests, such as screams, than younger infants. These age-related changes were mirrored by the differences in prohibitions and protests observed between 8-month-olds who could crawl and those who could not. Findings from this study were related to previous research on infant crying as an important part of the prelinguistic communication system.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2009	14	1					44	59	PII 908188334	10.1080/15250000802569694	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000802569694								32693470					WOS:000262788800004
J	Mather, E; Plunkett, K				Mather, Emily; Plunkett, Kim			Learning Words Over Time: The Role of Stimulus Repetition in Mutual Exclusivity	INFANCY					International Conference on Infant Studies	MAR, 2008	Vancouver, CANADA					During the second year of life, infants develop a preference to attach novel labels to novel objects. This behavior is commonly known as mutual exclusivity (Markman, 1989). In an intermodal preferential looking experiment with 19.5- and 22.5-month-olds, stimulus repetition was critical for observing mutual exclusivity. On the first occasion that a novel label was presented with 1 familiar object and 1 novel object, looking behavior was unsystematic. However, on reexposure to the same stimuli, 22.5-month-olds looked preferentially at the novel object prior to the re-presentation of the novel label. These findings suggest a powerful memory mechanism for novel labels and objects, enabling mutual exclusivity to emerge across repeated exposures to potential referents.

J	Kitamura, C; Lam, C				Kitamura, Christine; Lam, Christa			Age-Specific Preferences for Infant-Directed Affective Intent	INFANCY												This study examined the developmental course of infants' attentional preferences for 3 types of infant-directed affective intent, which have been shown to be commonly used at particular ages in the first year of life. Specifically, Kitamura and Burnham (2003) found mothers' tone of voice in infant-directed speech is most comforting between birth and 3 months, most approving at 6 months, and most directive at 9 months. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess whether there is a relation between the type of affective intent used by mothers at each age point, and infants' affective intent preferences. Each infant group, 3-, 6-, and 9-month-olds, was played the 3 types of affective intent alternating across a single test session. When analyzed across age, the interactions revealed the predicted developmental trajectory; that is, infant preferences transformed between 3 and 6 months from comforting to approving, and between 6 and 9 months, from approving to directive. However, when analyzed separately by age, it was shown that 3-month-olds preferred comforting to other types; 6-month-olds preferred approving to directive, but listened equally to approving and comforting; and 9-month-olds showed no preference for any type of affective intent. Because it was possible that 9-month-olds were more focused on phonetic and phonotactic information, a new group of 9-month-olds was tested with intonation-only versions of the 3 affective intent types. Under these conditions, they were found to prefer directive to comforting, but not directive to approving types. The results of this study have implications for what infants pay attention to in their social and linguistic environment over the course of the first year.

For the young walker, coordinating all these behavioral levels may be quite daunting. In this study, we examine the whole-body strategies to which infants resort to produce their first independent steps and progress over the first months of walking experience. Six infants were followed weekly from the onset of independent upright locomotion for 8 weeks, and then every other week until 4 months of walking experience. The walking kinematics from the infants' earliest steps were cluster-analyzed and the infants were classified into 3 groups. Follow-up comparisons with kinematics recordings were used to quantify the infants' strategies more precisely and track how these early forms of walking evolved over time. Results revealed that in the first weeks of independent walking, 3 infants used a stepping strategy, 1 used a twisting strategy, and 2 used a falling strategy to move their body forward and perform their first unsupported steps. As the infants gained walking experience, their walking patterns became more similar. These findings indicate that infants discover different solutions to use their body and control their balance when beginning to walk. With time, infants adopt a more efficient solution that incorporates and integrates elements of the different strategies.

INFANCY					Biennial Meeting of the Society-for-Research-in-Child-Development	MAR-APR -, 2007	Boston, MA	Soc Res Child Dev				The developmental origins of sharing remain little understood. Using procedures adapted from research on prosocial behavior in chimpanzees, we presented 18- and 25-month-old children with a sharing task in which they could choose to deliver food to themselves only, or to both themselves and another person, thereby making it possible for them to share without personal sacrifice. The potential recipient, a friendly adult, was either silent about her needs and wants or made them explicit. Both younger and older toddlers chose randomly when the recipient was silent. However, when the recipient vocalized her desires 25-month-olds shared, whereas younger children did not. Thus, we demonstrate that children voluntarily share valued resources with others by the end of the second year of life, but that this depends on explicit communicative cues about another's need or desire.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2009	14	1					117	130	PII 908190463	10.1080/15250000802569868	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000802569868								22639549					WOS:000262788800008

However, the developmental onset of this ability is unclear. In this study, we investigated whether 9- and 12-month-olds detect voluntary and implicit as well as nonvoluntary and explicit constraints in the head touch task. Three groups of infants watched video sequences, which displayed a person illuminating a lamp using the head. The hands of the model were either free, occupied by voluntarily holding a blanket, or nonvoluntarily restrained by being tied to the table. An additional control group of infants watched the model turning on the lamp by using the hand. Given that the majority of infants imitated the head touch when the model's hands were free, there was evidence for rational imitation in comparison to the condition in which the model's hands were tied to the table, but not in comparison to the condition in which the hands were occupied by holding a blanket. Nine-month-olds showed no differences in their behavior according to the condition. These findings clarify the onset of rational imitation by showing that 12-month-olds (but not 9-month-olds) take into account a situational constraint only when the constraint is nonvoluntary and explicit.

Maternal Sensitivity and the Learning-Promoting Effects of Depressed and Nondepressed Mothers' Infant-Directed Speech	INFANCY												The hypothesis that aspects of current mother-infant interactions predict an infant's response to maternal infant-directed speech (IDS) was tested. Relative to infants of nondepressed mothers, those of depressed mothers acquired weaker voice-face associations in response to their own mothers' IDS in a conditioned-attention paradigm, although this was partially attributable to demographic differences between the 2 groups. The extent of fundamental frequency modulation (F0) in maternal IDS was smaller for infants of depressed than nondepressed mothers, but did not predict infant learning. However, Emotional Availability Scale ratings of maternal sensitivity, coded from videotapes of mothers and infants engaged in a brief play interaction, were significant predictors of infant learning, even after maternal depression, its demographic correlates, and antidepressant medication use had been taken into account. These findings are consistent with a role for experience-dependent processes in determining the effects of IDS on infant learning.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2009	14	2					143	161	PII 909669554	10.1080/15250000802706924	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000802706924								20046973					WOS:000264338100001

Two initial experiments showed that 6-, 10-, and 14-month-olds preferred IDS directed toward younger infants, and 4-, 8-, 10-, and 14-month-olds, but not 6-month-olds, preferred IDS directed toward older infants. In Experiment 3, 6-month-olds preferred IDS directed toward older infants when the frequency of repeated utterances matched IDS to younger infants. In Experiment 4, 6-month-olds preferred repeated IDS utterances over the same IDS utterances organized without repetition. Attention to repeated utterances precedes word segmentation and sensitivity to statistical cues in continuous speech, and might play a role in the discovery of these and other aspects of linguistic structure.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2009	14	2					162	194	PII 909668539	10.1080/15250000802707062	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000802707062								32693465					WOS:000264338100002

We examined coregulated communication of parent-infant dyads during 5-min laboratory play sessions at 7 and 11 months. Few differences in mutually regulated communicative exchanges emerged between maternal and paternal dyads, and few developmental changes were found across the whole sample. Families with different communication profiles were identified, and changes rather than stability characterized communicative development at the family level. The family-level differences at 7 months predicted variation in children's language and communicative skills at 14 months.																			1525-0008						2009	14	2					195	221	PII 909669125	10.1080/15250000802707070	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000802707070								32693464					WOS:000264338100003

The question of whether infants use certain features (e.g., shape or color) more than others (e.g., luminance) can only be studied legitimately if visual salience is controlled, as the magnitude of feature valueshow noticeable and interesting they arewill affect results. We employed a novel methodology, interdimensional salience mapping, that allowed us to quantify and calibrate salience changes along shape, luminance, and color feature dimensions. We then compared 9-month-old infants' identification of objects, employing feature changes that were equally salient. These results show that infants more readily identify objects on the basis of color and shape than luminance. Additionally, we show that relative salience changes rapidly in infancyin particular, we found significantly higher salience thresholds for color in younger (6.5-month-old) infantsbut that individual differences within an age group are remarkably modest.

J	Feigenson, L; Yamaguchi, M				Feigenson, Lisa; Yamaguchi, Mariko			Limits on Infants' Ability to Dynamically Update Object Representations	INFANCY												Like adults, infants use working memory to represent occluded objects and can update these memory representations to reflect changes to a scene that unfold over time. Here we tested the limits of infants' ability to update object representations in working memory. Eleven-month-old infants participated in a modified foraging task in which they saw 2 quantities of crackers sequentially hidden in buckets and then were allowed to choose between them. We manipulated the working memory demands of the task by either hiding crackers in direct succession (i.e., infants saw all of the crackers hidden in the first location, then saw all of the crackers hidden in the second location), or hiding them in alternation (i.e., infants saw some crackers hidden in the first location, then saw some crackers hidden in the second location, then saw more crackers hidden in the first location). Across 6 experiments we found that infants successfully updated their representations of the hidden arrays when crackers were presented in succession. However, when crackers were hidden in alternation and infants had to reupdate an array that was no longer in the current focus of attention, infants showed a striking pattern of failure. These results suggest that, for infants as well as for adults, the flexibility of working memory is subject to processing constraints.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2009	14	2					244	262	PII 909670407	10.1080/15250000802707096	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000802707096								32693466					WOS:000264338100005

Eight-month-olds demonstrated holistic processing of upright own-race (Caucasian) faces, but featural processing of upright other-race (African) faces. Inverted faces were processed featurally, regardless of ethnicity. Four-month-olds, however, demonstrated holistic processing of both Caucasian and African upright faces. These results demonstrate that infants' processing of own- versus other-race faces becomes specialized between 4 and 8 months.

Automated Measurement of Facial Expression in Infant-Mother Interaction: A Pilot Study	INFANCY												Automated facial measurement using computer vision has the potential to objectively document continuous changes in behavior. To examine emotional expression and communication, we used automated measurements to quantify smile strength, eye constriction, and mouth opening in two 6-month-old infant-mother dyads who each engaged in a face-to-face interaction. Automated measurements showed high associations with anatomically based manual coding (concurrent validity); measurements of smiling showed high associations with mean ratings of positive emotion made by naive observers (construct validity). For both infants and mothers, smile strength and eye constriction (the Duchenne marker) were correlated over time, creating a continuous index of smile intensity. Infant and mother smile activity exhibited changing (nonstationary) local patterns of association, suggesting the dyadic repair and dissolution of states of affective synchrony. The study provides insights into the potential and limitations of automated measurement of facial action.

A Comparative Study of Arm-Restraint Methodology: Differential Effects of Mother and Stranger Restrainers on Infants' Distress Reactivity at 6 and 9 Months of Age	INFANCY												This study examined both differential patterns and the stability of infants' (N = 70) distress reactivity across mother and stranger arm-restraint conditions when infants were 6 and 9 months of age. Reactivity measures included observational variables for the rise, intensity, and duration of infant distress as well as motor activities associated with escape behaviors. Correlation analyses revealed that infant behaviors during arm restraint were modestly stable across conditions and over time; however, mean comparisons also showed that infants' distress responses appear to be sensitive to protocol parameters (whether restrainer is mother or stranger). At 6 months of age, infants cried more during maternal restraint than with strangers and exhibited escape behaviors more frequently with mothers. Findings further indicate that infants' distress reactivity undergoes developmental alterations from 6 to 9 months of age, with infants crying more quickly, reaching peak intensity of distress faster, and displaying more distress at 9 months compared to 6 months. These changes in infants' reactivity were particularly accentuated during maternal compared to stranger restraint conditions at 9 months of age.

Fear was positively related to shyness concurrently and longitudinally, but slightly more consistently at 18 months. The moderating roles of observed maternal sensitivity and children's sex in the relation between 18-month fearfulness and 30-month shyness, and between 18- and 30-month shyness, were tested. The positive relation between mother-reported fearfulness and shyness was strongest for sons of insensitive mothers but was not significant for daughters of sensitive, average, or insensitive mothers. The positive relation between mother-reported 18- and 30-month shyness was strongest for sons of insensitive mothers and for daughters of sensitive mothers. Moreover, when using scores of fear or shyness that were independent of each other, 18-month mother-reported fearfulness continued to interact with sex and sensitivity to predict 30-month shyness; however, the positive relation between Time 1 and Time 2 shyness was consistent across sex and levels of sensitivity.

Categorical Representation of Facial Expressions in the Infant Brain	INFANCY												Categorical perception, demonstrated as reduced discrimination of within-category relative to between-category differences in stimuli, has been found in a variety of perceptual domains in adults. To examine the development of categorical perception in the domain of facial expression processing, we used behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) methods to assess discrimination of within-category (happy-happy) and between-category (happy-sad) differences in facial expressions in 7-month-old infants. Data from a visual paired-comparison test and recordings of attention-sensitive ERPs showed no discrimination of facial expressions in the within-category condition, whereas reliable discrimination was observed in the between-category condition. The results also showed that face-sensitive ERPs over occipital-temporal scalp (P400) were attenuated in the within-category condition relative to the between-category condition, suggesting a potential neural basis for the reduced within-category sensitivity. Together, these results suggest that the neural systems underlying categorical representation of facial expressions emerge during the early stages of postnatal development, before acquisition of language.					nelson, charles/LBH-6397-2024	Nelson, Charles/0000-0002-4723-247X; Richmond, Jenny/0000-0002-5808-4249													1525-0008						2009	14	3					346	362	PII 911477661	10.1080/15250000902839393	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000902839393								20953267					WOS:000266248000005

By 18 months infants are capable of learning novel words in observational (or third-party) contexts (Floor Akhtar, 2006). To examine third-party gaze following in 12- and 18-month-olds, the parent and experimenter engaged in a conversation while the infant was present. For 8 trials approximately every 30 sec the experimenter would turn her head to the right or left to fixate on a toy placed on either side of the room with the parent following suit. In the first experiment, the parent was seated next to the infant and the experimenter opposite, whereas in the second experiment the positions of the adults were switched. In Experiment 1, 18-month-olds but not 12-month-olds followed gaze. In Experiment 2, 12-month-olds acquired a tendency to follow gaze during the experimental session. These results suggest that an incipient ability to follow third-party gaze is present by 12 months and that infants acquire a more reliable and general ability to follow the gaze of noninteractive others between 12 and 18 months.

Testing was conducted using a novel set of objects designed to enable young infants to readily identify the potential outcome of the model's actions. Infants who saw an adult's attempted-but-failed actions now produced her intended outcomes at an equivalent rate to infants who saw the model's completed acts, and significantly more so than infants who either observed an adult manipulating the test apparatus using nontarget actions or who did not see any actions demonstrated on the test apparatus. This result shows that, contrary to previous studies, 12-month-olds can produce the intended but unconsummated acts of others.

Relation Between Maternal Contingent Responsiveness and Infant Social Expectations	INFANCY												This study investigated the relation between maternal contingent responsiveness and 4- and 5-month-old infants' (N = 64) social expectation behavior in a still-face procedure. Mothers were asked to interact with their infants for 2 min (interactive phase), remain still-faced for 1 min (still-face phase), and resume interaction for 2 min. Mother and infant behavior was assessed for the frequency of infant and mother smiles, mother smiles that were contingent to infant smiles and infant smiles were contingent to mother smiles during the interactive phase, and infant social bids to mother during the still-face phase. Hierarchical regression showed that mother contingent smiles during the interactive phase accounted for unique variance in infant social bids during the still-face phase beyond that accounted for by the frequency of mother and infant smiles during the interactive phase. These results support the view that young infants' social expectations and sense of self-efficacy are formed within their interactions with their caregivers.																			1525-0008						2009	14	3					390	401	PII 911476279	10.1080/15250000902839955	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000902839955								32693537					WOS:000266248000008

INFANCY					International Conference on Infant Studies	MAR, 2008	Vancouver, CANADA					Adopting a procedure developed with human speakers, we examined infants' ability to follow a nonhuman agent's gaze direction and subsequently to use its gaze to learn new words. When a programmable robot acted as the speaker (Experiment 1), infants followed its gaze toward the word referent whether or not it coincided with their own focus of attention, but failed to learn a new word. When the speaker was human, infants correctly mapped the words (Experiment 2). Furthermore, when the robot interacted contingently, this did not facilitate infants' word mapping (Experiment 3). These findings suggest that gaze following upon hearing a novel word is not sufficient to learn the referent of the word when the speaker is nonhuman.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2009	14	4					414	438	PII 913377781	10.1080/15250000902994073	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000902994073								32693449					WOS:000268280400002

This asymmetry was taken as evidence for the proposal that consonants are more important than vowels at the lexical level. This study explores this consonant-vowel asymmetry in 16-month-old infants, using an interactive word learning task. It shows that the pattern of the 16-month-olds is the same as that of the 20-month-olds. Infants succeeded with 1-feature consonantal contrasts (either place or voicing) but were at chance level with 1-feature vocalic contrasts (either place or height). These results thus contribute to a growing body of evidence establishing, from early infancy to adulthood, that consonants and vowels have different roles in lexical acquisition and processing.

J	Stenberg, G				Stenberg, Gunilla			Selectivity in Infant Social Referencing	INFANCY					International Conference on Infant Studies	MAR, 2008	Vancouver, CANADA					In laboratory studies of social referencing, infants as young as 12 months have been reported to prefer looking at the experimenter over the caregiver for clarifying information. From an expertise perspective, such behavior could be interpreted as if the infant seeks information from others and can discriminate between persons who have or do not have relevant information to provide in the laboratory. If this is the case, higher order cognitive capacities might be involved in infant selectivity in looking in social referencing situations. However, it has also been proposed that associative learning processes might account for infant preferences in such studies. To examine whether an expertise perspective or if more basic learning processes best explain infant selectivity in looking, 40 12-month-old infants were assigned to 1 of 2 comparable conditions. The experimenter versus the caregiver presented an ambiguous toy and delivered positive information about the toy. The infants preferred to look at the experimenter and they regulated their behavior more in accordance with information coming from the experimenter. Thus, an associative learning account cannot explain infant preferences in looking. The results are discussed in terms of an expertise perspective.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2009	14	4					457	473	PII 913379221	10.1080/15250000902994115	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000902994115								32693452					WOS:000268280400004

Infants were familiarized with a photograph of a woman's face and then tested with the familiar face paired with a face differing in the (a) distance separating the eyes (a configural/eyes change), (b) distance between the nose and mouth (configural/mouth change), (c) size of the eyes (featural/eyes change), and (d) size of the mouth (featural/mouth change). Infants were shown to be more sensitive to (a) configural than featural change, and (b) change around the eyes versus the mouth.

Infant Discrimination of a Morphologically Relevant Word-Final Contrast	INFANCY					International Conference on Infant Studies	MAR, 2008	Vancouver, CANADA					Six-, 12-, and 18-month-old English-hearing infants were tested on their ability to discriminate nonword forms ending in the final stop consonants /k/ and /t/ from their counterparts with final /s/ added, resulting in final clusters /ks/ and /ts/, in a habituation-dishabituation, looking time paradigm. Infants at all 3 ages demonstrated an ability to discriminate this type of contrast, a contrast that constitutes one phonetic cue for the English morphological concepts of plural, possession, and person. These results suggest that across a significant portion of the development of infants' speech perception, this type of final contrast is discriminable.

We followed 76 low-risk premature infants and their mothers from the transition to oral feeding in the neonatal period to the end of the first year. Prior to hospital discharge, microlevel patterns of maternal touch and gaze were coded during feeding and nonfeeding interactions, global patterns of maternal adaptation were assessed, and infants' neurobehavioral status was tested. Psychomotor development was evaluated at 4 months. At 1 year, feeding difficulties were determined on the basis of maternal interview and direct observations of feeding interactions. Mothers of infants who exhibited feeding difficulties at 1 year showed less affectionate touch and gaze during nonfeeding interactions and more gaze aversion and lower adaptability during feeding interactions already in the neonatal period. Infants with feeding difficulties demonstrated poorer psychomotor performance at 4 months. Feeding interactions of infants with feeding difficulties at 1 year were characterized by higher maternal intrusiveness, lower infant involvement, and greater infant withdrawal. Less maternal affectionate touch and lower maternal adaptation in the neonatal period, poor infant psychomotor skills, and higher maternal intrusiveness and lower infant involvement at 1 year predicted feeding difficulties. The findings underscore the role of the relational components across the first year in the development of feeding difficulties.

Infants' Response to Maternal Mirroring in the Still Face and Replay Tasks	INFANCY												Infants' response to maternal mirroring was investigated in 4-month-old infants. Mother-infant dyads participated in the still face and replay tasks. Infants were grouped by those whose mothers did and did not mirror their behavior in the interactive phases of the tasks. In the still face task, infants with maternal mirroring showed more attention, smiling, and positive vocalizations across the phases, although both groups of infants demonstrated the still-face effect with attention and smiling. Infants' social bidding to the mother during the still-face phase correlated with mothers' mirroring behavior. In the replay task, infants with maternal mirroring demonstrated carryover effects with smiling; infants without maternal mirroring showed no awareness of change in their mothers' behavior. In both the still face and replay tasks, infants with maternal mirroring were more engaged with their mothers. Results suggest that maternal mirroring of infants' behavior affects infants' detection of, and response to, reciprocal interaction.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2009	14	5					526	549		10.1080/15250000903144181	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000903144181								32693532					WOS:000270212900002

Here we present 6-month-old infants with a complex visual array containing faces among multiple visual objects. Despite the competing objects, infants direct their first saccade toward faces more frequently than expected by chance (Experiment 1). The attention-grabbing effect of faces is not selective to upright faces (Experiment 2) but does require the presence of internal facial elements, as faces whose interior has been phase-scrambled did not attract infants' attention (Experiment 3). On the contrary, when the number of fixations is considered, upright faces are scanned more extensively than both inverted and phase-scrambled faces. The difference in selectivity between the first look measure and the fixation count measure is discussed in light of a distinction between attention-grabbing and attention-holding mechanisms.

Development of Multimodal Processing in Infancy	INFANCY												A number of studies have investigated infants' abilities to extract and discriminate number from multimodal events. These results have been mixed for several possible reasons, including aspects of the experimental design that provide perceptual cues that are unrelated to number, and are known to influence looking preferences. This experiment used a preferential looking paradigm to investigate whether 6- to 9-month-old infants can extract the amodal property of number from an arbitrarily related multimodal event sequence when nonnumerical confounds are removed. Results demonstrate that female infants discriminate number from a multimodal presentation by 6 months, whereas males do so by 8 months. Further, the study underscores the importance of controlling for low-level perceptual cues in looking time experiments aimed at examining infants' cognitive abilities.

Infants saw a human hand holding a ring repeatedly approach the top of a plastic cone in an apparent failed attempt to place the ring on the cone. The hand and ring then bounced away from the top of the cone toward the floor. Thus, some information presented was relevant to the goal (the motion toward the goal, the afforded relationship between the ring and the cone, and the repeated attempt), but some of it was irrelevant to the goal (the movement away from the goal). Infants were presented with 2 test events: 1 that was consistent with all the trajectory information but inconsistent with the goal, and 1 that was consistent with the goal. Eight-month-olds looked longer to the trajectory-consistent event, suggesting they were able to infer the goal despite the physical ambiguity. Infants who had not been habituated to the failed attempt or who saw a matched inanimate control did not show this pattern, suggesting that infants in the first year of life actively and selectively analyze the unfulfilled goal-directed behavior of others.

In the first year of life, infants acquire considerable word segmentation abilities. Infants at this early stage in word segmentation rely to a large extent on the metrical pattern of their native language, at least in stress-based languages. In Dutch and English (both languages with a preferred trochaic stress pattern), segmentation of strong-weak words develops rapidly between 7 and 10 months of age. Nevertheless, trochaic languages contain not only strong-weak words but also words with a weak-strong stress pattern. In this article, we present electrophysiological evidence of the beginnings of weak-strong word segmentation in Dutch 10-month-olds. At this age, the ability to combine different cues for efficient word segmentation does not yet seem to be completely developed. We provide evidence that Dutch infants still largely rely on strong syllables, even for the segmentation of weak-strong words.

In Experiment 1, infants received 2 versions of a means-end task in counterbalanced order. In the action perception version, a preferential looking paradigm in which infants were shown an actor performing means-end behavior with an expected and an unexpected outcome was used. In the action production version, infants had to pull a cloth to receive a toy. In Experiment 2, infants' ability to perform the action production task with a cloth was compared to their ability to perform the action production task with a less flexible board. Finally, Experiment 3 was designed to control for alternative low-level explanations of the differences in the looking times toward the final states presented in Experiment 1 by only presenting the final states of the action perception task without showing the initial action sequence. Results obtained in Experiment 1 showed that in the action perception task, infants discriminated between the expected and the unexpected outcome. This perceptual ability was independent of their actual competence in executing means- end behavior in the action production task. Experiment 2 showed no difference in 6-month-olds' performance in the action production task depending on the properties of the support under the toy. Similarly, in Experiment 3, no differences in looking times between the 2 final states were found. The findings are discussed in light of theories on the development of action perception and action production.

The incomplete 2-tone Mooney stimuli were used because they preclude focusing both on the local features (i.e., the fine details of the individual features) and on the second-order relational information (i.e., the distance between the internal elements); therefore, face detection can rely only on a Gestalt representation of a face. Two experiments were carried out by using a preferential looking procedure. Experiment 1 demonstrated that newborns prefer upright Mooney faces to inverted Mooney faces (180 degrees rotated). Experiment 2 showed that newborns prefer a Mooney face as compared to a Mooney-like object equated for the number of elements in the upper part. Overall, the results indicate that newborns bind and organize the fragmentary parts of the Mooneized face stimulus into a whole and detect the first-order relations of a face on the basis of holistic processing.					simion, francesca/D-6175-2015	simion, francesca/0000-0002-0101-9753; LEO, IRENE/0000-0002-4925-4373													1525-0008	1532-7078					2009	14	6					641	653	PII 917026891	10.1080/15250000903264047	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000903264047								32693516					WOS:000271977200003

IDS is characterized by exaggerated intonation, as well as reduced speech rate, shorter utterance duration, and grammatical simplification. It is commonly asserted that IDS serves in part to facilitate language learning. Although intuitively appealing, direct empirical tests of this claim are surprisingly scarce. Additionally, studies that have examined associations between IDS and language learning have measured learning within a single laboratory session rather than the type of long-term storage of information necessary for word learning. In this study, 7- and 8-month-old infants' long-term memory for words was assessed when words were spoken in IDS and adult-directed speech (ADS). Word recognition over the long term was successful for words introduced in IDS, but not for those introduced in ADS, regardless of the register in which recognition stimuli were produced. Findings are discussed in the context of the influence of particular input styles on emergent word knowledge in prelexical infants.

Seven-Month-Old Infants Selectively Reproduce the Goals of Animate But Not Inanimate Agents	INFANCY												We tested 7-month-old infants' sensitivity to others' goals in an imitation task, and assessed whether infants are as likely to imitate the goals of nonhuman agents as they are to imitate human goals. In the current studies, we used the paradigm developed by Hamlin et. al (in press) to test infants' responses to human actions versus closely matched inanimate object motions. The experimental events resembled those from Luo and Baillargeon's (2005) looking-time study in which infants responded to the movements of an inanimate object (a self-propelled box) as goal-directed. Although infants responded visually to the goal structure of the object's movement, here they did not reproduce the box's goal. These results provide further evidence that 7-month-olds' goal representations are sufficiently robust to drive their own manual actions. However, they indicate that infants' responses to inanimate object movements may not be robust in this way.

We compared perception of /bu/ versus /gu/ in 6- to 8-month-olds using a visual fixation procedure. Infants were habituated to multiple natural productions of 1 syllable type and then presented 4 test trials (old-new-old-new). Perception of the new syllable (indexed as novelty preference) was compared across 3 groups: habituated and tested on syllables in quiet (Group 1), habituated and tested on syllables mixed with a nonspeech signal (Group 2), and habituated with syllables mixed with a non-speech signal and tested on syllables in quiet (Group 3). In Groups 2 and 3, each syllable was mixed with a segment spliced from a recording of bird and cricket songs. This nonspeech signal has no overlapping frequencies with the syllable; it is not expected to alter the sensory structure or perceptual coherence of the syllable. Perception was negatively affected by the presence of the auditory distracter during habituation; individual performance levels also varied more in these groups. The findings show that perceiving speech in the presence of irrelevant sounds poses a cognitive challenge for young infants. We conclude that selective attention is an important skill that supports speech perception in infants; the significance of this skill for language learning during infancy deserves investigation.					; Molnar, Monika/B-7027-2016	Polka, Linda/0000-0003-4761-9057; Molnar, Monika/0000-0003-1337-9948													1525-0008	1532-7078				SEP-OCT	2008	13	5					421	439		10.1080/15250000802329297	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000802329297													WOS:000260092700001
J	Johnson, EK; Seidl, A				Johnson, Elizabeth K.; Seidl, Amanda			Clause Segmentation by 6-Month-Old Infants: A Crosslinguistic Perspective	INFANCY												Each clause and phrase boundary necessarily aligns with a word boundary. Thus, infants' attention to the edges of clauses and phrases may help them learn some of the language-specific cues defining word boundaries. Attention to prosodically well-formed clauses and phrases may also help infants begin to extract information important for learning the grammatical structure of their language. Despite the potentially important role that the perception of large prosodic units may play in early language acquisition, there has been little work investigating the extraction of these units from fluent speech by infants learning languages other than English. We report 2 experiments investigating Dutch learners' clause segmentation abilities. In these studies, Dutch-learning 6-month-olds readily extract clauses from speech. However, Dutch learners differ from English learners in that they seem to be more reliant on pauses to detect clause boundaries. Two closely related explanations for this finding are considered. both of which stein from the acoustic differences in clause boundary realizations ill Dutch versus English.

In this study, infants received verbal and facial signals of 2 different, negatively valenced emotions (fear and sadness) as well as neutral affect via a television monitor to determine if they could make qualitative distinctions among emotions of the same valence. Twenty 12- to 14-month-olds and 20 16- to 18-month-olds were examined. Results suggested that younger infants showed no evidence of referential specificity, as they responded similarly to both the target and distracter toys, and showed no evidence of affect specificity, showing no difference in play between affect conditions. Older infants, in contrast, showed evidence both of referential and affect specificity. With respect to affect specificity. 16- to 18-month-olds touched the target toy less in the fear condition than in the sad condition and showed a larger proportion of negative facial expressions in the sad condition versus the fear condition. These findings suggest a developmental emergence after 15 months of age for affect specificity in relating emotional messages to objects.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				SEP-OCT	2008	13	5					456	468		10.1080/15250000802329370	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000802329370													WOS:000260092700003

We examined the longitudinal development of infant sleep in families experiencing high (n = 58) or low (n = 64) levels of psychosocial adversity, and the contributions of neonatal self-regulatory capacities and maternal settling strategies to this development. Assessments of infant sleep at 4-, 7-, and 12-weeks postpartum indicated no differences in sleeping difficulties between high- and low-adversity groups. However, more infant sleep difficulties were reported in the high- versus low-adversity groups at 12- and 18-month follow-ups. Neonatal self-regulatory capacities were not related to the presence or absence of adversity, or to subsequent infant sleep quality. However, there were group differences in maternal settling strategies that did predict subsequent infant sleep difficulties. The pattern of sleep disturbance observed in association with maternal psychosocial adversity at 18-months was consistent with risk for broader impairments in child functioning.

The Relation of Cumulative Demographic Risk to Mothers' Responsivity and Control: Examining the Role of Toddler Temperament	INFANCY												The relations of cumulative demographic risk and children's temperament to mothers' parenting behaviors were examined when children were 18 (T1, n = 247) and 30 (T2, n = 216) months of age. Mothers, nonparental caregivers (e.g., child care providers), and observers reported on children's temperament to create a temperament composite, and mothers reported on demographic risk variables. Maternal responsivity and control were observed during 2 mother-child interactions at both time points. Cumulative demographic risk was related to low maternal responsivity concurrently and longitudinally, even after controlling for earlier temperament and responsivity. and demographic risk was positively related to maternal control at T1 and T2. Regulated temperament (i.e., low frustration and high regulation) was linked with high maternal responsivity at T1 and T2 and low maternal control at T2. Moreover, the positive relation between cumulative risk and maternal control at T1 was stronger when children were viewed as less regulated.

Children (24-35 months old) viewed videos showing a robot attempting to manipulate an object (e.g., putting beads inside a cup) but failing to achieve its goal (e.g., beads fell outside the cup). In 1 video, the robot made eye contact with a human before and after it failed the action. In another video, the robot did not make eye contact with the human adult. Only in the former condition did children "imitate" the robot's "intended" but unconsummated actions (e.g., putting beads inside a cup). When the robot did not make eye contact, children performed poorly, at the baseline level. These results suggest that human-like gaze behaviors, not human-like morphology, may play an important role in young children's imitation of a nonhuman agent's goal-directed behaviors.

Infants' gaze was measured using a Tobii 1750 eye tracker. Six-, 9-, and 12-month-olds' first gaze shift from the model's face (after the model started turning) was directed to the attended toy. The 5-month-olds performed at random. Following this initial response, 5-, 6, and 9-month-olds performed more gaze shifts to the attended target; 12-month-olds performed at random. Infants at all ages displayed longer looking times to the attended toy. We discuss a number of explanations for 5-month-olds' ability to follow a shift in overt attention by an adult after an initially random response, including the possibility that infants' initial gaze response strengthens the representation of the objects in the peripheral visual field.

Infants' Sensitivity to the Depth Cue of Height-in-the-Picture-Plane	INFANCY												Five- and 7-month-old infants' sensitivity to the pictorial depth cue of height-in-the-picture-plane was assessed. Infants were presented with 2 objects, 1 higher than the other, and their reaching was recorded under monocular and binocular viewing conditions. The results showed that both age groups reached significantly more to the lower, apparently closer object under monocular view and that they reached equally to the 2 objects under binocular view. The results suggest that both 5- and 7-month-old infants are sensitive to the depth information provided by height-in-the-picture-plane. Demonstration of pictorial depth sensitivity at 5 months has implications for the mechanism underlying the onset of sensitivity to this type of depth information.																			1525-0008					SEP-OCT	2008	13	5					544	555		10.1080/15250000802329545	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000802329545													WOS:000260092700008

The cat is out of the bag: The joint influence of previous experience and looking behavior on infant categorization	INFANCY					4th Biennial Meeting of the Cognitive-Development-Society	OCT, 2005	San Diego, CA	Cognit Dev Soc				We examined the effect of 4-month-old infants' previous experience with dogs, cats, or both and their online looking behavior on their learning of the adult-defined category of cat in a visual familiarization task. Four-month-old infants' (N = 123) learning in the laboratory was jointly determined by whether or not they had experience with pets at home and how much they shifted their gaze back and forth between the stimuli during familiarization. Specifically, only infants with pets at home who also exhibited high levels of switching during familiarization remembered the individual cat exemplars or formed a summary representation of those cats. These results are consistent with recent theorizing about the processes of how infants' categorical representations are formed, and provide new understanding into how infants' categorization unfolds over time.

Changes in the ability to detect ordinal numerical relationships between 9 and 11 months of age	INFANCY					Biennial Meeting of the Society-for-Research-in-Child-Development	MAR, 2007	Boston, MA	Soc Res Child Dev				When are the precursors of ordinal numerical knowledge first evident in infancy? Brannon (2002) argued that by 11 months of age, infants possess the ability to appreciate the greater than and less than relations between numerical values but that this ability experiences a sudden onset between 9 and 11 months of age. Here we present 5 experiments that explore the changes that take place between 9 and 11 months of age in infants' ability to detect reversals in the ordinal direction of a sequence of arrays. In Experiment 1, we replicate the finding that 11- but not 9-month-old infants detect a numerical ordinal reversal. In Experiment 2 we rule out an alternative hypothesis that 11-month-old infants attended to changes in the absolute numerosity of the first stimulus in the sequence rather than a reversal in ordinal direction. In Experiment 3, we demonstrate that 9-month-old infants are not aided by additional exposure to each numerosity stimulus in a sequence. In Experiment 4 we find that 11-month-old but not 9-month-old infants succeed at detecting the reversal in a nonnumerical size or area-based rule, casting doubt on Brannon's prior claim that what develops between 9 and 11 months of age is a specifically numerical ability. In Experiment 5 we demonstrate that 9-month-old infants are capable of detecting a reversal in ordinal direction but only when there are multiple converging cues to ordinality. Collectively these data indicate that at 11 months of age infants can represent ordinal relations that are based on number, size, or cumulative area, whereas at 9 months of age infants are unable to use any of these dimensions in isolation but instead require a confluence of cues.																			1525-0008					JUL-AUG	2008	13	4					308	337		10.1080/15250000802188800	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000802188800								20703362					WOS:000258330300002

Nonmigrant Latina mothers and infants engaged in person-directed behaviors longer than Latino immigrant or European American mothers and infants. Mother and infant person-directed behaviors were positively related; mother and infant object-related behaviors were related for some cultural groups but not others. Nearly all mother and infant behaviors were mutually contingent. Mothers were more responsive to infants' behaviors than infants were to mothers. Some cultural differences in responsiveness emerged.

How mothers encourage and discourage infants' motor actions	INFANCY												The content of mothers' emotional, verbal, and gestural communication to their infants was examined under conditions of potential physical risk in a laboratory motor task. Mothers encouraged and discouraged their 12- and 18-month-old infants to crawl or walk down a sloping walkway. Mothers expressed positive affect on nearly every trial. They rarely expressed purely negative affect in their faces and voices, even when discouraging. Instead, they discouraged infants with a mixture of positive and negative expressions. In both encourage and discourage conditions, mothers coupled their emotional messages with rich verbal and gestural information to elicit infants' attention, regulate their location, guide their actions, and describe the situation and potential consequences of their actions. The content of mothers' communication was attuned to infants' age and locomotor experience.

Comparison at 32-37 weeks postconception of infants born 1983-1989 and 1995-2004 on the neurobehavioral assessment of the preterm infant	INFANCY												In spite of numerous recent outcome studies of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants, no data exist on their development prior to term. In this study we traced and compared the neurobehavioral development of 251 ELBW (< 1,000 g) and 240 low birth weight (LBW; 1,000 g-2,500 g) preterms born between 1995 and 2004 from 32 to 37 weeks postconceptional age (PCA), using the Neurobehavioral Assessment of the Preterm Infant (NAPI; Korner & Thom, 1990). Compared to the original NAPI cohort of 521 infants (born 1983-1989), the ELBW and LBW infants were at higher medical risk, displayed weaker motor development, a tighter scarf sign and popliteal angle at all or most PCAs, and a weaker cry at older PCAs; they did not differ in irritability and percent asleep ratings. Few differences were noted between the ELBW and LBW groups. Research is now needed to determine whether the 1995 to 2004 NAPI values of ELBW and LBW infants at 32 to 37 weeks PCA are predictive of later outcome of high-risk preterms.

J	Smith, NA; Trainor, LJ				Smith, Nicholas A.; Trainor, Laurel J.			Infant-directed speech is modulated by infant feedback	INFANCY												When mothers engage in infant-directed (ID) speech, their voices change in a number of characteristic ways, including adopting a higher overall pitch. Studies have examined these acoustical cues and have tested infants' preferences for ID speech. However, little is known about how these cues change with maternal sensitivity to infant feedback in the context of interaction. In this study, each mother watched her infant (located in an adjacent sound booth) on a video screen and talked to him or her through a microphone. The mother believed that her infant could hear her voice and she attempted to make her infant happy through her vocalizations. In reality, the infant could not hear her voice. The mother's ID speech was analyzed in real time for changes in mean pitch. For half of the infant-mother dyads an experimenter surreptitiously positively engaged the infant when the voice analysis revealed a rise in pitch, thereby producing positive reinforcement to the mother for natural higher pitched ID speech. The other half were reinforced for lower pitched ID speech. Mothers raised their pitch significantly more in the former than the latter condition, illustrating that the pitch of ID speech is dynamically affected by feedback from the infant.

Prenatal development of interlimb motor learning in the rat fetus	INFANCY												The role of sensory feedback in the early ontogeny of motor coordination remains a topic of speculation and debate. On E20 of gestation (the 20th day after conception, 2 days before birth), rat fetuses can alter interlimb coordination after a period of training with an interlimb yoke, which constrains limb movement and promotes synchronized, conjugate movement of the yoked limbs. The aim of this study was to determine how the ability to express this form of motor learning may change during prenatal development. Fetal rats were prepared for in vivo study at 4 ages (E18-21) and tested in a 65-min training-and-testing session examining hind limb motor learning. A significant increase in conjugate hind limb activity was expressed by E19, but not E18 fetuses, with further increases in conjugate hind limb activity on E20 and E21. These findings suggest substantial development of the ability of fetal rats to modify patterns of interlimb coordination in response to kinesthetic feedback during motor training before birth.

Experiment I presents evidence on the coupling of head and eye movements and thus the validity of the head camera view of the infant's visual field in the geometry of the task context. Experiment 2 demonstrates the use of this method in the naturalistic context of toy play with a parent. The results point to the embodied nature of toddlers' attentional strategies and to importance of hands and hand actions in their visual experience of objects. The head camera thus appears to be a promising method that, despite some limitations, will yield new insights about the ecology and content of young children's experiences.

J	Smitsman, AW; Cox, RFA				Smitsman, Ad W.; Cox, Ralf F. A.			Perseveration in tool use: A window for understanding the dynamics of the action-selection process	INFANCY												Two experiments investigated how 3-year-old children select a tool to perform a manual task, with a focus on their perseverative parameter choices for the various relationships involved in handling a tool: the actor-to-tool relation and the tool-to-target relation (topology). The first study concerned the parameter value for the tool-to-target relation by asking how children use a cane for either pushing an object further away (exclosure; outside the hook) or pulling an object nearby (enclosure; inside the hook). The second study concerned the parameter value for the hand-to-tool relation by assessing the hand used for grasping a spoon to feed a puppet. Results from both studies showed that on the first trial, choices were driven by task information. However, when the task switched from pulling to pushing or from left hand to right hand, or vice versa, children persevered with the choice they made during the 4 previous trials. Results are discussed in terms of the dynamical field modeling work of Esther Thelen and her colleagues. Our findings underscore Thelen's hypotheses that: (a) the action-selection process is a dynamic affair, affected by multiple influences at different time scales and its own intrinsic dynamics; and (b) that perseverative behavior is a general phenomenon that is neither indicative for a specific period in the development, nor for a particular task. Similarly, we argue that the presence (or absence) of causal understanding emerges from the action-selection process, rather than determining this process.

This study concerns the ability to represent a particular kind of spatial information, namely, the geometry of an enclosed layout-an ability present in older children, adults, and nonhuman animals (e.g., Cheng, 1986; Hermer & Spelke, 1996). Using a looking-time procedure, 4.5- to 6.5-month-olds were tested on whether they could distinguish among the corners of an isosceles triangle. On each trial, the target corner was marked by a red dot. The stimulus (triangle with dot) appeared from different orientations across trials, ensuring that only cues related to the triangle itself could be used to differentiate the corners. When orientations were highly variable, infants discriminated the unique corner (i.e., the corner with the smaller angle and two equal-length sides) from a nonunique corner; they could not discriminate between the two nonunique corners. With less variable orientations, however, infants did discriminate between the nonunique corners of the isosceles triangle. Implications for how infants represent geometric cues are discussed.																			1525-0008	1532-7078				MAR-APR	2008	13	2					103	127		10.1080/15250000701795572	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000701795572								33412723					WOS:000254838200001

Fast mapping but poor retention by 24-month-old infants	INFANCY					15th Biennial International Conference on Infant Studies	JUN 18-23, 2006	Kyoto, JAPAN	Int Soc Infant Studies				Four experiments explored the processes that bridge between referent selection and word learning. Twenty-four-month-old infants were presented with several novel names during a referent selection task that included both familiar and novel objects and tested for retention after a 5-min delay. The 5-min delay ensured that word learning was based on retrieval from long-term memory. Moreover, the relative familiarity of objects used during the retention test was explicitly controlled. Across experiments, infants were excellent at referent selection, but very poor at retention. Although the highly controlled retention test was clearly challenging, infants were able to demonstrate retention of the first 4 novel names presented in the session when referent selection was augmented with ostensive naming. These results suggest that fast mapping is robust for reference selection but might be more transient than previously reported for lexical retention. The relations between reference selection and retention are discussed in terms of competitive processes on 2 timescales: competition among objects on individual referent selection trials and competition among multiple novel name-object mappings made across an experimental session.

Half of the observers saw each mother paired with her own infant and another infant of the same age (mother tapes) and half saw each infant paired with his or her mother and with a stranger (infant tapes). Observers were asked to judge which was the mother-infant dyad in each pair. Observers' accuracy improved as infants aged and was above chance for both mother and infant tapes when infants were 6 months. Differences between mother-infant and stranger-infant dyadic communication patterns also emerged as the infants aged. At 6 months, mother-infant dyads had more symmetrical communication and less asymmetrical communication than stranger-infant dyads.																			1525-0008					MAR-APR	2008	13	2					158	171		10.1080/15250000701795614	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000701795614								33412726					WOS:000254838200003

Type of maternal object motion during synchronous naming predicts preverbal infants' learning of word-object relations	INFANCY												Mothers' use of specific types of object motion in synchrony with object naming was examined, along with infants' joint attention to the mother and object, as a predictor of word learning. During a semistructured 3-min play episode, mothers (N = 24) taught the names of 2 toy objects to their preverbal 6- to 8-month-old infants. The episodes were recoded from Gogate, Bolzani, and Betancourt (2006) to provide a more fine-grained description of object motions used by mothers during naming. The results indicated that mothers used forward/downward and shaking motions more frequently and upward and backward motions less frequently in temporal synchrony with the spoken words. These motions likely highlight novel word-object relations. Furthermore, maternal use of shaking motions in synchrony with the spoken words and infants' ability to switch gaze from mother to object contributed to infants' learning of the word-object relations, as observed on a posttest. Thus, preverbal infants' learn word-object relations within an embodied system involving tightly coupled interaction between infants' perception and joint attention, and specific properties of caregivers' naming.

Sixty-four 24-month-old infants participated. In a test of synchronic imitation, infants were given a toy while a model simultaneously performed novel actions on an identical toy. Infants were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 model conditions: a familiar person, an unfamiliar person, disembodied human hands, and disembodied robotic pincers. Infants were as likely to synchronically imitate disembodied hands as a person. Imitation of the pincers was significantly lower. This pattern suggests that 2-year-olds will engage socially with human hands in the absence of the rest of the body.

Factors influencing individual differences in these aspects of affective behavior include temperament, context of situation, and parents, to name a few. Gender differences in the expression of affective behaviors have also been implicated in past research. However, differences are not always found, especially before preschool ages. This study examined the presence of gender differences and moderating influences of gender on the expression of distress and mother-oriented behaviors (e.g., comfort seeking and proximity to mother) in 24-month-old toddlers during a series of situations designed to elicit either fear or frustration. Girls were more likely to seek contact from mother and stay in closer proximity to her compared to boys even after controlling for distress. However, the association between distress and contact seeking or proximity was significant for boys but not for girls. The discussion focuses on implications for biological and socialization effects of sex-typed behavior and consequences for adjustment.

By quasi-experimental design half of the 12- to 18-month-old infants had prior exposure to the program content and the other half did not. Cluster analysis based on parental verbalizations revealed 3 types of parental coviewing style: high, medium, and low scaffold. Looking time was significantly higher for infants previously exposed to these videos than for those who were not. Infant looking time was also significantly higher, and infants responded more, when parents provided high levels of scaffolding in the form of questions and labels or descriptions. The results suggest that both prior exposure and parental style are associated with infant attention and responsiveness to television and have important implications for both parents and television producers.

J	Singh, L; Nestor, SS; Bortfeld, H				Singh, Leher; Nestor, Sarah S.; Bortfeld, Heather			Overcoming the effects of variation in infant speech segmentation: Influences of word familiarity	INFANCY												Previous studies have shown that 7.5-month-olds can track and encode words in fluent speech, but they fail to equate instances of a word that contrast in talker gender, vocal affect, and fundamental frequency. By 10.5 months, they succeed at generalizing across such variability, marking a clear transition period during which infants' word recognition skills become qualitatively more mature. Here we explore the role of word familiarity in this critical transition and, in particular, whether words that occur frequently in a child's listening environment (i.e., "Mommy" and "Daddy") are more easily recognized when they differ in surface characteristics than those that infants have not previously encountered (termed nonwords). Results demonstrate that words are segmented from continuous speech in a more linguistically mature fashion than nonwords at 7.5 months, but at 10.5 months, both words and nonwords are segmented in a relatively mature fashion. These findings suggest that early word recognition is facilitated in cases where infants have had significant exposure to items, but at later stages, infants are able to segment items regardless of their presumed familiarity.

Peter			Behavior of mothers and infants with and without Down syndrome during the still-face procedure	INFANCY												There has been limited study of how the constitutional characteristics of infants with Down syndrome (DS) influence the patterning of their relations with caregivers. To assess natural and perturbed interactions between infants with DS and their mothers, we tested ten 6-month-old infants with DS and 20 typically developing (TD) 4-month-old of similar mental age. Participants were videotaped with their mothers in a natural face-to-face interaction, a brief period when the mothers adopted a still-face, and a subsequent reengagement phase. There was little to distinguish the infants in the initial phase of natural interaction, but the mothers of infants with DS were more likely to show assertive warmth, and unlike in the case of mothers of TD infants, high maternal directiveness tended to be associated with lower levels of infant looking and lack of fussing. During the still-face episode, infants of both groups showed reduced looking and smiling, although infants with DS tended to show lower levels of fussing and fewer in this group showed fussing in the reengagement phase. Therefore DS infants were somewhat similar to TD infants of comparable mental age in being responsive to the still-face procedure, but showed indications of group differences in intense emotional reactivity.

This study investigated whether 14-month-old infants know precisely what they have and have not shared in a special way (and with whom). In the experimental condition an adult and infant shared an object (the target) excitedly because it unexpectedly reappeared in several places. They then shared 2 other objects (the distractors) in a more normal fashion. Later, the adult reacted excitedly to a tray containing all 3 objects and then made an ambiguous request for the infant to hand "it" to her. There were 2 control conditions. In I of them, a different adult, who knew none of the 3 objects, made the ambiguous request. In the other control condition, the adult who made the request had previously experienced the objects only alone, while the infant looked on unengaged. Infants in the experimental condition chose the target object more often than the distractors and more often than they chose it in either control condition. These results demonstrate that 14-month-old infants can identify which one of a set of objects "we"-and not just I or you alone-have had a special experience with in the past.

Yet little is known about whether many of the factors that are known to affect encoding, storage, and retrieval in older children and adults are also integral to memory processes at birth. Here we tested for the presence at birth of the retroactive interference and repetition priming effects using the visual paired comparison paradigm. Newborns' memory performance on a visual recognition task was prevented by the interposition of a distractor stimulus between the habituation and the test phase (retroactive interference, Experiment 1). However, forgetting was offset by further brief exposure to the familiar stimulus (repetition priming, Experiments 2 and 3).						turati, chiara/0000-0001-7496-1830													1525-0008						2008	13	6					557	569	PII 905993797	10.1080/15250000802458666	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000802458666													WOS:000261189400001

We examined relationships among gestational age, learning speed, and behavioral and physiological reactivity in 55 preterm and 49 full-term infants during baseline, contingency, and nonreinforcement phases of a conjugate mobile paradigm at 3 months corrected age. For all infants, negative affect, looking duration, and heart rate levels increased during contingency and nonreinforcement phases, whereas respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA, an index of parasympathetic activity) decreased and cortisol did not change. Learners showed greater RSA suppression and less negative affect than nonlearners. This pattern was particularly evident in the preterm group. Overall, preterm infants showed less learning, spent less time looking at the mobile, and had lower cortisol levels than full-term infants. Preterm infants also showed greater heart rate responses to contingency and dampened heart rate responses to nonreinforcement compared to full-term infants. Findings underscore differences in basal and reactivity measures in preterm compared to full-term infants and suggest that the capacity to regulate parasympathetic activity during a challenge enhances learning in preterm infants.

J	Jones, EJH; Herbert, JS				Jones, Emily J. H.; Herbert, Jane S.			The Effect of Learning Experiences and Context on Infant Imitation and Generalization	INFANCY												Over the first years of life, infants gradually develop the ability to retrieve their memories across cue and contextual changes. Whereas maturational factors drive some of these developments in memory ability, experiences occurring within the learning event may also impact infants' ability to retrieve memories in new situations. In 2 experiments we examined whether it was possible to facilitate 12-month-old infants' generalization of learning in the deferred imitation paradigm by varying experiences before or during the demonstration session, or during the retention interval. In Experiment 1, altering the length, timing, or variability of training had no impact on generalization; infants showed a low, but consistent level of memory retrieval. In Experiment 2, infants who experienced a unique context for encoding and retrieval exhibited generalization; infants who experienced the context prior to the demonstration session, or during the retention interval, did not. Specificity is a robust feature of infant memory and is not substantially altered by encoding experiences in an observational learning paradigm. Previous history with a learning environment can, however, impact the flexibility of memory retrieval.

Infants were presented with test toys of land animals (quadrupeds), cars, and hybrids made by recombining car parts with animal parts. Infants who experienced a context emphasizing a taxonomic divide were subsequently more likely to form categories that reflected a taxonomic divide, whereas infants who experienced a context emphasizing a partonomic divide were subsequently more likely to form categories based on functional parts. These results suggest that 18-month-olds can adapt their categorization strategies flexibly in accordance with ambient contextual cues. This adds to the growing body of evidence that early categorization is flexible and not rigidly tied to characteristic features in the environment.

Using this data set, this study explored relations between maternal talk about mental states during mothers' free play with their infants and the emergence of joint visual attention in infants. Contrary to hypothesis, mothers' comments about their infants' perceptual states significantly declined after their infants began to engage in joint visual attention. Comments about other mental states did not change relative to acquisition of joint visual attention skill. We speculate that after infants begin to reliably follow gaze and points, mothers may switch the focus of their conversation from their infants' visual behavior and experiences to the object of their mutual attention.

In the first experiment, we presented a simple, partly occluded shape to the infants until habituation was reached. Then we showed either a probable completion (one that would be predicted on the basis of both local and global cues) or an improbable completion. Longer looking times were found for the improbably completed shape (compared to probable and control conditions), suggesting that the probable shape was perceived during partial occlusion. In the second experiment, infants were habituated to more ambiguous partly occluded shapes, where local and global cues would result in different completions. For adults, the percept of these shapes is usually dominated by global influences. However, after habituation the infants looked longer at the globally completed shapes. These results suggest that by the age of 4 months, infants are able to infer the perceptual completion of partly occluded shapes, but for more ambiguous shapes, this completion seems to be dominated by local influences.					van Lier, Rob/E-1654-2012	Dejonckheere, Peter/0000-0002-7993-031X													1525-0008	1532-7078					2008	13	6					660	674	PII 905999613	10.1080/15250000802458864	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000802458864													WOS:000261189400006

Development of Visual Selection in 3-to 9-Month-Olds: Evidence From Saccades to Previously Ignored Locations	INFANCY												We examined changes in the efficiency of visual selection over the first postnatal year with an adapted version of a spatial negative priming paradigm. In this task, when a previously ignored location becomes the target to be selected, responses to it are impaired, providing a measure of visual selection. Oculomotor latencies to target selection were the dependent measure. Each trial consisted of a prime and a probe presentation, separated by a 67-, 200-, or 550-msec interstimulus interval (ISI), to test the efficiency of selection as a function of processing time. In the prime, the target was accompanied by a distractor item. In the probe, the target appeared either in the location formerly occupied by the distractor (repeated distractor trials) or in one of the other two locations (control trials). We tested 41 infants in each of 3 age groups (3, 6, and 9 months) on the three different ISIs. Nine-month-old infants' saccade latencies were slowed on repeated distractors relative to control trials, given sufficiently long ISIs. Saccade latencies in the youngest two age groups showed only facilitation on repeated distractor trials at short ISIs. These results suggest that visual selection efficiency is a function of the interaction of the processing limitations of a system with environmental conditions, in this case the time allotted for the selection process.																			1525-0008						2008	13	6					675	686	PII 906001223	10.1080/15250000802459060	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15250000802459060								19337575					WOS:000261189400007

The Effect of Repetition on Infants' Imitation From Picture Books Varying in Iconicity	INFANCY												Although picture-book reading is commonplace during infancy, little is known about the impact of this activity on learning. A previous study showed that 18- and 24-month-olds imitated a novel action sequence presented in a book that was illustrated with realistic color photos, whereas they failed to imitate from books illustrated with less realistic drawings. In the research reported here, we hypothesized that increasing infants' exposure to a picture book would increase learning from books illustrated with both color photos and drawings. Independent groups of 18- and 24-month-olds were exposed to a picture book either twice in succession or 4 times in succession. The results showed that, regardless of the iconicity of the illustrations, increasing the number of reading sessions significantly improved the infants' imitation scores, compared to age-matched, no-demonstration controls. The results are discussed in relation to representational insight and cognitive flexibility.

Receptive grammatical knowledge of familiar content words and inflection in 16-month-olds	INFANCY												This study examines 16-month-olds' understanding of word order and inflectional properties of familiar nouns and verbs. Infants preferred grammatical sentences over ungrammatical sentences when the ungrammaticality was cued by both misplaced inflection and word order reversal of nouns and verbs. Infants were also sensitive to inflection alone as a cue to grammaticality, but not word order alone. The preference for grammatical sentence forms was also disrupted when adjacent function word cues were removed from the stimuli, and when familiar content words were replaced by nonce words. These results suggest that sensitivity to the relationship between functional morphemes and content words, rather than sensitivity to either independently. drives the development of early grammatical knowledge. Furthermore, infants showed some ability to generalize from familiar to nonce content word contexts.

Mechanisms of visual object recognition in infancy: Five-month-olds generalize beyond the interpolation of familiar views	INFANCY												This work examined predictions of the interpolation of familiar views (IFV) account of object recognition performance in 5-month-olds. Infants were familiarized to an object either from a single viewpoint or from multiple viewpoints varying in rotation around a single axis. Object recognition was then tested in both conditions with the same object rotated around a novel axis. Infants in the multiple-views condition recognized the object, whereas infants in the single-view condition provided no evidence for recognition. Under the same 2 familiarization conditions, infants in a 2nd experiment treated as novel an object that differed in only I component from the familiar object. Infants' object recognition is enhanced by experience with multiple views, even when that experience is around an orthogonal axis of rotation, and infants are sensitive to even subtle shape differences between components of similar objects. In general, infants' performance does not accord with the predictions of the IFV model of object recognition. These findings motivate the extension of future research and theory beyond the limits of strictly interpolative mechanisms.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2007	12	1					31	43		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00232.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00232.x								33412728					WOS:000248353300002
J	Leerkes, EM; Burney, RV				Leerkes, Esther M.; Burney, Regan V.			The development of parenting efficacy among new mothers and fathers	INFANCY												Predictors of prenatal and postnatal parenting efficacy were examined in a sample of 115 primiparous mothers and 73 fathers in an effort to examine the association between preexisting parental characteristics and prenatal efficacy and the association between prenatal characteristics and postnatal efficacy when aspects of the current parenting context are taken into account. The most robust predictors of maternal postnatal efficacy included both prenatal efficacy, which significantly predicted postnatal efficacy independent of all other predictors including the current parenting context, and perceived infant temperamental reactivity as both a main effect and as buffered by social support. This was not the case for fathers, whose postnatal efficacy was primarily a function of their amount of involvement in parenting tasks and social support. The differential predictors of mother and father efficacy as well as their implications for future research are discussed.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2007	12	1					45	67		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00233.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00233.x								33412727					WOS:000248353300003

Research on prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) indicates that exposure to stress in utero results in developmental deficits. We hypothesized that children exposed to high objective PNMS from a natural disaster early in pregnancy would exhibit higher rates of stereotypical play and lower rates of mature functional play than their low-stress counterparts would. We examined the functional play abilities of 52 2-year-olds exposed to low or high objective PNMS from a natural disaster within a nonstructured play session. Toddlers exposed to high objective PNMS, subjective PNNIS, or both exhibited less functional and more stereotypical toy play, with less diversity, compared to toddlers exposed to low FNMS. PNMS appears to affect functional play development in toddlers negatively. These results replicate delays in language and intellectual functioning observed in these toddlers using the Bayley Scales.

The other-race effect in infancy: Evidence using a morphing technique	INFANCY												Human adults are more accurate at discriminating faces from their own race than faces from;mother race. This other-race effect (ORE) has been characterized as a reflection of face processing specialization arising from differential experience with own-race faces. We examined whether 3.5-month-old infants exhibit ORE using morphed faces on which adults had displayed a crossover ORE (i.e., Caucasians performed better on Caucasian faces and Asians performed better on Asian faces). In this experiment, Caucasian infants who had grown up in a predominantly Caucasian environment discriminated 100% Caucasian faces from 70% Caucasian/30% Asian morphed faces but failed to discriminate between the corresponding 100% Asian and 70% Asian/30% Caucasian faces. Thus, 3.5-month-olds exhibited evidence of ORE. These results indicate that at least by 3.5 months of age, infants have attained enough face processing expertise to process familiar-race faces in a different manner than unfamiliar-race faces.

Infants' reactions to object collision on hit and miss trajectories	INFANCY												This experiment investigated the impact of the path of approach of an object, from head on versus from the side, and the type of imminent contact with that object, a hit versus a miss, on young infants' perceptions of object looming. Consistent with earlier studies, we found that 4- to 5-month-old infants do indeed discriminate hits versus misses. We also found a novel result regarding the path of the approaching object. The discrimination of hits from misses was modified by whether or not the approaching objects passed in front of the infants' faces; objects crossing the line of sight evoked more frequent defensive reactions than objects that did not cross the line of sight, regardless of whether or not such objects were on a collision course. These findings are discussed within the context of the development of visually guided locomotion and linear versus nonlinear paths of translation through the world.

However, most infant speech discrimination paradigms have been designed to test group effects rather than individual differences. Other procedures suffer from high attrition rates. In this study, we developed 4 variants of the Visual Habituation Procedure (VHP) and assessed their robustness in detecting individual 9-month-old infants' ability to discriminate highly contrastive nonwords. In each variant, infants were first habituated to audiovisual repetitions of a nonword (seepug) before entering the test phase. The test phase in Experiment 1 (extended variant) consisted of 7 old trials (seepug) and 7 novel trials (boodup) in alternating order. In Experiment 2, we tested 3 novel variants that incorporated methodological features of other behavioral paradigms. For the oddity variant, only 4 novel trials and 10 old trials were used. The stimulus alternation variant was identical to the extended variant except that novel trials were replaced with "alternating" trials-trials that contained repetitions of both the old and novel nonwords. The hybrid variant incorporated elements from both the oddity and the stimulus alternation variants. The hybrid variant proved to be the most successful in detecting statistically significant discrimination in individual infants (8 out of 10), suggesting that both the oddity and the stimulus alternation features contribute to providing a robust methodology for assessing discrimination in individual infants. In Experiment 3, we found that the hybrid variant had good test-retest reliability. Implications of these results for future infant speech perception work with clinical populations are discussed.

J	Bhatt, RS; Hayden, A; Quinn, PC				Bhatt, Ramesh S.; Hayden, Angela; Quinn, Paul C.			Perceptual organization based on common region in infancy	INFANCY												We examined whether infants organize information according to the newly proposed principle of common region, which states that elements within a region are grouped together and separated from those of other regions. In Experiment 1, 6- to 7-month-olds exhibited sensitivity to regions by discriminating between the displacement of an element within a region versus across regions. In Experiments 2 (6- to 7-month-olds) and 3 (3- to 4-month-olds), infants who were habituated to 2 elements in each of 2 regions subsequently discriminated between a familiar and novel grouping in familiar and novel regions. Thus, infants as young as 3 to 4 months of age are not only sensitive to regions in visual images, but also use these regions to group elements in accord with the principle of common region. Because common region analysis is critical to such basic visual functions as figure-ground and object segregation, these results suggest that the organizational mechanism that underlies many vital visual functions is already operational by 3 to 4 months of age.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2007	12	2					147	168		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00238.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00238.x								33412744					WOS:000249842600002

The effect of vocabulary size on toddlers' receptiveness to unexpected testimony about category membership	INFANCY					15th Biennial International Conference on Infant Studies	JUN 18-23, 2006	Kyoto, JAPAN	Int Soc Infant Studies				Children must be willing to accept some of what they hear "on faith," even when that testimony conflicts with their own expectations. The study reported here investigated the relation among vocabulary size, object recognition, and 24-month-olds' (N = 40) willingness to accept potentially surprising testimony about the category to which an object belongs. Results showed that children with larger vocabularies were better able to recognize atypical exemplars of familiar categories than children with smaller vocabularies. However, they were also most likely to accept unexpected testimony that an object that looked like a member of one familiar category was actually a member of another. These results indicate that 24-month-olds trust classifications provided by adult labeling patterns even when they conflict with the classifications children generate on their own.

Maternal sensitivity and child responsiveness: Associations with social context, maternal characteristics, and child characteristics in a multivariate analysis	INFANCY												This study examined unique associations of multiple distal context variables (family socioeconomic status [SES], maternal employment, and paternal parenting) and proximal maternal (personality, intelligence, and knowledge; behavior, self-perceptions, and attributions) and child (age, gender, representation, language, and sociability) characteristics with maternal sensitivity and child responsiveness in 254 European American mothers and their firstborn 20-month-olds. Specific unique relations emerged in hierarchical regression analyses. Mothers who worked fewer hours per week and reported less dissonance in their husbands' didactic parenting, whose children spoke using more vocabulary, and who reported less limit setting in their parenting and attributed their parenting failures to internal causes were observed to be more sensitive in their interactions with their children. Children in higher SES families, whose mothers worked fewer hours and attributed their parenting failures to internal causes, and who themselves used more vocabulary were observed to be more responsive in their interactions with their mothers. Although potential associations are many, when considered together, unique associations with maternal sensitivity and child responsiveness are few, and some are shared whereas others are unique.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2007	12	2					189	223		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00240.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00240.x								33412745					WOS:000249842600004
J	Leibold, LJ; Werner, LA				Leibold, Lori J.; Werner, Lynne A.			Infant auditory sensitivity to pure tones and frequency-modulated tones	INFANCY												It has been suggested that infants respond preferentially to infant-directed speech because their auditory sensitivity to sounds with extensive frequency modulation (FM) is better than their sensitivity to less modulated Sounds. In this experiment, auditory thresholds for FM tones and for unmodulated, or pure, tones in a background of noise were measured for 4-month-old infants using a conditioned response procedure. The FM tones swept from 150 to 275 Hz or from 150 to 550 Hz. The frequency of the pure tone was either 275 or 550 Hz. The results showed that infants were slightly, but significantly, more sensitive to the sounds that included 550 Hz than they were to the lower frequency sounds, whether or not the sound was frequency modulated. It appears that infants could be somewhat more sensitive to infant-directed than to adult-directed speech, not because of FM per se, but because the fundamental frequency excursions in infant-directed speech extend into a higher frequency range than those in adult-directed speech.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2007	12	2					225	233		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00241.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00241.x								33412743					WOS:000249842600005

Baby Facial Action Coding System coding of both lip corner raising (simple or non-Duchenne) and lip corner raising with cheek raising (Duchenne smile) was followed by a smile recognition task using 48 naive observers. Both types of smiles were detected in all behavioral states. Lip corner raising with cheek raising (Duchenne smiling) tended to predominate in active (rapid eye movement) sleep, suggesting a potential tie to early constituents of emotion. A significant portion of the typically briefer lip corner raising distinguished by expert coders was not recognized as smiling by the naive observers. These briefer actions may represent a motor phenomenon idiosyncratic to the neonatal period.

J	Layton, D; Rochat, P				Layton, Derek; Rochat, Philippe			Contribution of motion information to maternal face discrimination in infancy	INFANCY												The contribution of motion and feature invariant information in infants' discrimination of maternal versus female stranger faces was assessed. Using an infant controlled habituation-dishabituation procedure, 4- and 8-month-old infants (N = 62) were tested for their ability to discriminate between their mother and a female stranger in 4 different conditions varying whether motion or feature information about the faces was available. The faces were presented in a still or dynamic video image with either a positive or a negative, contrast. In each condition, infants habituated to a stranger's face and then viewed, in 3 pairs of alternating novelty test trials, either a new stranger or their mother's face. Results show that motion information contributes to the 8-month-old infants', but not the 4-month-old infants' discrimination of maternal faces. These results are interpreted in relation to recent findings and models in the adult literature suggesting that there is an enhanced contribution of dynamic information in face recognition when the face is familiar. Our data confirm that from the outset, there is a complex interplay of feature and motion information in the discrimination of the mother's face when the viewing condition is not optimal.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2007	12	3					257	271		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00243.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00243.x													WOS:000251106600002

Whereas the physical health consequences to infants of prenatal exposure to smoking are well established, the early neurobehavioral consequences are less well understood. This study investigated the neurobehavioral consequences of prenatal exposure to smoking using an epidemiologically derived sample of 454 infants who were drawn from a larger sample of 1,292 infants whose families were recruited at birth. Results indicated that, on average, infants who were exposed to higher levels of prenatal smoking exhibited less positive affect and greater irritability. Moreover, among male infants, elevated levels of prenatal exposure to smoking were associated with lower levels of approach, gross motor movement, reactivity, and attention. There was no evidence that the effects of prenatal exposure to smoking on infant neurobehavioral functioning were mediated by physical growth parameters (infant weight and head circumference) that are also known to be affected by prenatal exposure to smoking.

J	Wilcox, T				Wilcox, Teresa			Sex differences in infants' mapping of complex occlusion sequences: Further evidence	INFANCY												Recently, infant researchers have reported sex differences in infants' capacity to map their representation of an occlusion sequence onto a subsequent no-occlusion display. The research reported here sought to identify the extent to which these sex differences are observed in event-mapping tasks and to identify the underlying basis for these differences. Two experiments were conducted with 9.5-, 10.5-, and 11.5- month-olds using the following task. First, infants were shown an occlusion event in which a box and a ball emerged successively to opposite sides of a screen. Then, the screen was lowered and infants saw a single ball on the platform. Boys first showed prolonged looking to the 1-ball display at 10.5 months, suggesting that at 10.5 months, boys detected the inconsistency between the box-ball occlusion sequence and the final 1-ball display. In contrast, girls first showed prolonged looking to the I-ball display at 11.5 months. However, girls did show prolonged looking at 10.5 months if they were shown an outline of the box-ball occlusion sequence prior to the test trials. These results provide converging evidence for the conclusion that boys are more likely than girls to successfully map complex occlusion sequences onto no-occlusion displays. These results also suggest that boys perform better on event-mapping tasks because they are more adept at extracting the simple structure of complex occlusion sequences that they can then retrieve and compare to the final display, but that girls can extract the simple structure under more supportive conditions. Possible reasons for these robust, albeit transient, sex differences are suggested.

J	Mash, C				Mash, Clay			Object representation in infants' coordination of manipulative force	INFANCY												This study examined infants' use of object knowledge for scaling the manipulative force of object-directed actions. Infants 9, 12, and 15 months of age were outfitted with motion-analysis sensors on their arms and then presented with stimulus objects to examine individually over a series of familiarization trials. Two stimulus objects were used in the familiarization phase, and were identical in size, shape, and material, but different in color and weight. Following familiarization, two test objects that had been hidden from view were presented. The test objects were identical in appearance to the familiarization objects, but their color-weight correspondence was reversed. Infants' actions on the test objects revealed selective, differential preparation for the specific weights experienced during familiarization. Because the objects were equivalent in their visual affordances for action, the differential preparation and coordination of manipulative force was based on knowledge acquired during the familiarization phase. Infants are capable of utilizing object representations to coordinate manipulative force in object-directed actions.																			1525-0008						2007	12	3					329	341		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00246.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00246.x													WOS:000251106600005

Event-related potentials were recorded while infants listened to familiar words in IDS, familiar words in ADS, unfamiliar words in IDS, and unfamiliar words in ADS. The results indicated that IDS elicited increased neural activity compared to ADS for both age groups. Six-month-olds showed a boost in neural activity to IDS for familiar words only. Thirteen-month-olds exhibited increased brain activity to IDS for both familiar and unfamiliar words. The results suggested that IDS changed as a function of development and word familiarity and served as an attentional spotlight to increase brain activity to potentially meaningful words.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2007	11	1					31	62		10.1207/s15327078in1101_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in1101_2													WOS:000244472800002

Relations between mother-child interactions and the neural correlates of face processing in 6-month-olds	INFANCY					International Conference on Infant Studies	MAY 05-08, 2004	Chicago, IL					Developmental studies of face processing have revealed age-related changes in how infants allocate neurophysiological resources to the face of a caregiver and an unfamiliar adult. We hypothesize that developmental changes in how infants interact with their caregiver are related to the changes in brain response. We studied 6-month-olds because this age is frequently noted in the behavioral and neurophysiological literature as a time of transition in which infants begin to discriminate more readily between caregivers and unfamiliar adults. We used infants' behavioral responses to an original behavioral paradigm to predict event-related potential (ERP) responses to pictures of the mother's face and a stranger's face in the same group of participants. Our results suggest that individual differences in infants' proximity-seeking behaviors during interactions with the mother correlate with their neurophysiological responses to the mother's face as opposed to an unfamiliar face for the Nc component of the ERP. These results have implications for understanding the role of the changing infant-caregiver relationship on the development of the face processing system in early infancy.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2007	11	1					63	86		10.1207/s15327078in1101_3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in1101_3													WOS:000244472800003

Dynamic noun generalization: Moment-to-moment interactions shape children's naming biases	INFANCY					International Conference on Infant Studies	MAY 05-08, 2004	Chicago, IL					Recent research on early word learning suggests that children's behavior when-generalizing novel nouns integrates their prior vocabulary knowledge with the specifics of the task. This study examines how these factors interact on the moment-to-moment time scale of the training children receive and the sequence of stimuli they are shown. In I condition, we used a combination of training and stimulus factors predicted to produce a bias to generalize nouns by shape similarity. We then reduced this shape bias and amplified a bias to generalize nouns by material similarity via manipulations of training and stimuli across 3 other conditions. Additional analyses suggest that children's generalizations on individual trials are influenced by what they have seen and done on previous trials. These results highlight the importance of the task and stimuli in bringing children's prior knowledge to bear in early word learning.					; Kavlie, Jessica/F-5523-2012	Samuelson, Larissa/0000-0002-9141-3286; Kavlie, Jessica/0000-0003-3200-5239													1525-0008						2007	11	1					97	110		10.1207/s15327078in1101_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in1101_5													WOS:000244472800005
J	Stenberg, G; Hagekull, B				Stenberg, Gunilla; Hagekull, Berit			Infant looking behavior in ambiguous situations: Social referencing or attachment behavior?	INFANCY												Is infant looking behavior in ambiguous situations best described in terms of information seeking (social referencing) or as attachment behavior? Twelve-month-old infants were assigned to I of 2 conditions (Study 1); each infant's mother provided positive information about an ambiguous toy and an experimenter provided positive information. In Study 2, 12-month-old infants were assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: mother provided positive information about the toy, mother was inattentive, or mother provided negative information; the experimenter was inattentive. The infants preferred to look at the experimenter in almost all conditions and they regulated their behavior in accordance with information obtained from the experimenter. None of the studies lends support for an explanation in terms of behaviors deriving from the attachment system, and they raise questions concerning social referencing interpretations of infants' looking behavior. Other alternatives for explaining infant looking behavior in social referencing situations (e.g., associative learning) are discussed.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2007	11	2					111	129		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00218.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00218.x													WOS:000246826100001

Do infants show distinct negative facial expressions for fear and anger? Emotional expression in 11-month-old European American, Chinese, and Japanese infants	INFANCY												Do infants show distinct negative facial expressions for different negative emotions? To address this question, European American, Chinese, and Japanese 11-month-olds were videotaped during procedures designed to elicit mild anger or frustration and fear. Facial behavior was coded using Baby FACS, an anatomically based scoring system. Infants' nonfacial behavior differed across procedures, suggesting that the target emotions were successfully elicited. However evidence for distinct emotion-specific facial configurations corresponding to fear versus anger was not obtained. Although facial responses were largely similar across cultures, some differences also were observed. Results are discussed in terms of functionalist and dynamical systems approaches to emotion and emotional expression.

J	Moore, C; Mealiea, J; Garon, N				Moore, Chris; Mealiea, Jennifer; Garon, Nancy			The development of body self-awareness	INFANCY												Two experiments examined toddlers' performance on a new task designed to examine the development of body self-awareness. The new task was conceived from observations by Piaget (1953/1977) and theoretical work from Povinelli and Cant (1995) and involved a toy shopping cart to the back of which a small mat had been attached. Children were asked to push the cart to their mothers but in attempting to do so they had to step on the mat and in consequence, their body weight prevented the cart from moving. In the first experiment, performance on the shopping cart task was examined in children of 16 and 21 months both when the self was the obstacle and when a heavy weight was the obstacle. Results showed significant improvement with age in performance for the self-version of the task that was not matched by similar age differences in the weight task. In the second experiment, children's performance on both the self-version of the shopping cart and on a standard mirror self-recognition task was assessed. Results showed a significant correlation independent of age for these 2 tasks. These findings provide further evidence for the notion that toddlers develop an objective awareness of the self during the 2nd year. They are also consistent with the idea that body self-awareness is heightened in situations requiring self-monitoring during movement.

Effects of posture on newborn crying	INFANCY												Acoustic properties of the cries of 14 infants were evaluated at both 2 and 4 weeks of age when the infants were lying in a supine position and when they were sitting upright in a car seat. In the upright position, infants' breathing was more rapid and showed less individual variability. The fundamental frequency of their cries increased in the upright position, but this increase was likely attributable to increased arousal or distress, not to posture per se. There were no differences in acoustic measures related to vocal tract shape in the supine versus upright positions. Across age, there was a decline in fundamental frequency. Individual difference stability of most acoustic measures was moderate to high. The importance of postural effects on the acoustic features of cries was discussed.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2007	11	2					175	189		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00221.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00221.x													WOS:000246826100004

The influence of mouthing on infant vocalization	INFANCY					14th Biennial Conference of the International-Society-on-Infant-Studies	MAY, 2004	Chicago, IL	Int Soc Infant Studies				Although vocalization and mouthing are behaviors frequently performed by infants, little is known about the characteristics of vocalizations that occur with objects, hands, or fingers in infants' mouths. The purpose of this research was to investigate characteristics of vocalizations associated with mouthing in 6- to 9-month-old infants during play with a primary caregiver. Results suggest that mouthing may influence the phonetic characteristics of vocalizations by introducing vocal tract closure and variation in consonant production.

Such modifications have been called infant-directed action (IDA) or motionese (Brand, Baldwin, & Ashburn, 2002). We investigated the IDA features of interactiveness and simplification by quantifying eye gaze, object exchanges, and action units enacted between exchanges in 42 mothers' demonstrations of novel objects to infants (6-8 months or 11-13 months) or adults. We found more eye gaze, more object exchanges, and fewer action types per turn in demonstrations to infants relative to adults. Unlike prior research using global measurements, we detected differences in behavior directed at infants of different ages: Shorter, more frequent gazes and more exchanges characterized demonstrations to older versus younger infants. These findings indicate the fruitfulness of fine-grained analysis of IDA, and further clarify how adults may support infants' processing of human motion.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2007	11	2					203	214		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00223.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00223.x													WOS:000246826100006
J	Moore, C; Povinelli, DJ				Moore, Chris; Povinelli, Daniel J.			Differences in how 12-and 24-month-olds interpret the gaze of adults	INFANCY												This study examined the hypothesis that toddlers interpret an adult's head turn as evidence that the adult was looking at something, whereas younger infants interpret gaze based on an expectancy that an interesting object will be present on the side to which the adult has turned. Infants of 12 months and toddlers of 24 months were first shown that an adult head turn to the side predicted the activation of a remote-controlled toy on that side of the room. After this connection had been demonstrated, participants were assigned to 2 conditions. In the head turn condition the toys were removed but the adult continued to produce head turns to the side. In the toy condition the adult stopped turning but the toys continued to be activated when the participant turned toward them. Results showed that, compared to 12-month-olds, 24-month-olds were more likely to continue to turn to the side when the adult continued to turn even though there was no longer anything of interest to see. In contrast, compared to 24-month-olds, 12-month-olds were, if anything, more likely to continue to turn to the side in the condition in which the adult stopped turning. The latter result was replicated in a condition in which the activation of the toy was not contingent on the child's own head turn. These results imply that the meaning of gaze following may change significantly over the 2nd year of life. For 12-month-olds, gaze is a useful predictor of where interesting sights may occur. In contrast, for 24-month-olds, gaze may be a signal that the adult is looking at something.

J	Robinson, CW; Sloutsky, VM				Robinson, Christopher W.; Sloutsky, Vladimir M.			Linguistic labels and categorization in infancy: Do labels facilitate or hinder?	INFANCY												Although it is generally accepted that labels facilitate categorization in infancy, recent evidence suggests that infants and young children are more likely to process visual input when presented in isolation than when paired with nonlinguistic sounds or linguistic labels. These findings suggest that auditory input (when compared to a no-auditory baseline) may hinder rather than facilitate categorization. This study assessed 8-month-olds' (n = 191) and 12-month-olds' (n = 81) abilities to form categories when images were paired with nonlinguistic sounds, linguistic labels, and when presented in isolation. Overall, infants accumulated more looking when visual stimuli were accompanied by sounds or labels; however, infants were more likely to categorize when the visual images were presented without an auditory stimulus.

Individual differences in the contribution of maternal soothing to infant distress reduction	INFANCY												This study investigates individual differences in the contribution of specific maternal regulatory behaviors to the mother-infant dyad's regulation of infant distress response. Additionally, we examined the stability of infants' stress responses and the stability of specific maternal soothing behaviors. The sample included 128 mother-infant dyads that were observed during an inoculation at 2 and 6 months. The average intensity of infant cry response showed modest stability across age only before controlling for the infant's general state of irritability, and the duration of crying was not stable. Of the 8 specific maternal regulatory behaviors studied, affection, touching, and vocalizing showed the strongest stability across infant age. Finally, an index of the contingency between maternal soothing and infant cry reduction at 2 months predicted shorter cry duration but not cry intensity at 6 months. The results of this study indicate that infants whose mothers showed a greater contribution to reducing their distress at 2 months showed a shorter duration of crying 4 months later. This suggests a possible longitudinal influence of maternal regulation on infants' distress responses.

The infants helped another person by handing over objects the other person was unsuccessfully reaching for, but did not help reliably in situations involving more complex goals. When a programmed adult partner interrupted a joint cooperative activity at specific moments, infants sometimes tried to reengage the adult, perhaps indicating that they understood the interdependency of actions toward a shared goal. However, as compared to 18- and 24-month-olds, their skills in behaviorally coordinating their actions with a social partner remained rudimentary. Results are integrated into a model of cooperative activities as they develop over the 2nd year of life.																			1525-0008						2007	11	3					271	294		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00227.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00227.x								33412734					WOS:000246864000004

It is not just about location: Infants perseverate to container shape during object search	INFANCY					Biennial Meeting of the Society-for-Research-in-Child-Development	APR 15-18, 1999	ALBUQUERQUE, NM	Soc Res Child Dev				In searching for a toy hidden at a new location, infants will err by searching at the previously correct location. This study investigated the possibility that 8.5-month-old infants would perseverate on the basis of other visual features by which covers could be individuated. Infants saw a toy hidden under I of 2 distinctly shaped covers. Following successful retrievals from the Shape A cover, infants saw the toy hidden under the Shape B cover. On this B trial, the covers were at locations that had not been baited on the preceding trials, precluding location perseveration. The infants erred by choosing the unbaited Shape A cover more often than control infants presented with I type of cover throughout. The findings suggest that infants perseverate to cover shape and are form biases biased toward cover shape even when location information is sufficient to support retrieval.																			1525-0008						2007	11	3					295	303		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00228.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00228.x								33412739					WOS:000246864000005

Infants were habituated to a visual display in which they saw a toy hidden, followed by either rotation of the point of observation through the world (simulated self-movement) or movement of the object itself through the world (object movement). Following habituation, infants saw test displays in which the hidden toy reappeared at the correct or incorrect location, relative to the earlier movements. Infants habituated to simulated self-movement looked longer at the recovery of the toy from an incorrect, relative to correct location. In contrast, infants habituated to object movement showed no differential looking to either correct or incorrect test displays. These findings are discussed within a theoretical framework of spatial orientation emphasizing the availability and use of spatial information.

Thirty-two 7.5- to 11.5-month-old infants were familiarized with video sequences made up of short action clips. Narration coincided with portions of the action stream to package certain pairs of clips together. At test, packaged and nonpackaged pairs of actions were presented side by side in silence. Narration heard during familiarization influenced how infants viewed the action units, such that at test, infants older than 9.5 months (but not younger) looked longer at the nonpackaged than the packaged action sequences. The role of infant-directed speech as well as other types of acoustic input in assisting infants' processing of action is discussed.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2007	11	3					321	332		10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00230.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00230.x								33412733					WOS:000246864000007

Common coding of observation and execution of action in 9-month-old infants	INFANCY												Do 9-month-old infants motorically simulate actions they perceive others perform? Two experiments tested whether action observation, like overt reaching, is sufficient to elicit the Piagetian A-not-B error. Infants recovered a toy hidden at location A or observed an experimenter recover the toy. After the toy was hidden at location B, infants in both conditions perseverated in reaching to A, demonstrating that active search by the infant is not necessary for the A-not-B error. Consistent with prior research, infants displayed an ipsilateral bias when reaching, the so-called mysterious midline barrier. A similar ipsilateral bias was also observed depending on the manner in which the experimenter reached; infants perseverated following observation of ipsi- but not contralateral reaches by the experimenter. Thus, infants perseverated only following observation of actions they themselves were able to perform, suggesting that they coded others' actions in terms of motor simulation.

J	Newman, RS; Hussain, I				Newman, Rochelle S.; Hussain, Isma			Changes in preference for infant-directed speech in low and moderate noise by 4.5-to 13-month-olds	INFANCY												Although a large literature discusses infants' preference for infant-directed speech (IDS), few studies have examined how this preference might change over time or across listening situations. The work reported here compares infants' preference for IDS while listening in a quiet versus a noisy environment, and across 3 points in development: 4.5 months of age, 9 months of age, and 13 months of age. Several studies have suggested that IDS might help infants to pick out speech in the context of noise (Colombo, Frick, Ryther, Coldren, & Mitchell, 1995; Fernald, 1984; Newman, 2003); this might suggest that infants' preference for IDS would increase in these settings. However, this was not found to be the case; at all 3 ages, infants showed similar advantage (or lack thereof) for IDS as compared to adult-directed speech when presented in noise versus silence. There was, however, a significant interaction across ages: Infants aged 4.5 months showed an overall preference for IDS, whereas older infants did not, despite listening to the same stimuli. The lack of an effect with older infants replicates and extends recent findings by Hayashi, Tamekawa, and Kiritani (2001), suggesting that the variations in fundamental frequency and affect are not sufficient cues to IDS for older infants.

J	Zamuner, TS				Zamuner, Tania S.			Sensitivity to word-final phonotactics in 9-to 16-month-old infants	INFANCY												Previous research has shown that infants begin to display sensitivities to language-specific phonotactics and probabilistic phonotactics at around 9 months of age. However, certain phonotactic patterns have not yet been examined, such as contrast neutralization, in which phonemic contrasts are neutralized typically in syllable- or word-final position. Thus, the acquisition of contrast neutralization is dependent on infants' ability to perceive certain contrasts in final position. The studies reported here test infants' sensitivity to voicing neutralization in word-final position and infants' discrimination of voicing and place of articulation (POA) contrasts in word-initial and word-final position. Nine and 11-month-old Dutch-learning infants showed no preference for legal versus illegal voicing phonotactics that were contrasted in word-final position. Furthermore, 10-month-old infants showed no discrimination of voicing or POA contrasts in word-final position, whereas they did show sensitivity to the same contrasts in word-initial position. By 16 months, infants were able to discriminate POA contrasts in word-final position, although showing no discrimination of the word-final voicing contrast. These findings have broad implications for models of how learners acquire the phonological structures of their language, for the types of phonotactic structures to which infants are presumed to be sensitive, and for the relative sensitivity to phonemic distinctions by syllable and word position during acquisition.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2006	10	1					77	95		10.1207/s15327078in1001_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in1001_5								33412672					WOS:000239415500005

Toddlers' empathy-related responding to distress: Predictions from negative emotionality and maternal behavior in infancy	INFANCY												This study focused on the predictive contributions of infants' temperamental negative emotionality (proneness to fear, anger), sex, maternal responsivity, and their interaction on toddlers' empathy-related responding to distress in 3 contexts. Ninety-eight infants and their mothers participated in a longitudinal study. When the infants were 10 months of age, mothers completed assessments of infant temperamental anger and fear, and maternal behaviors were observed in a free-play setting. At 18 months of age, toddlers' empathy-related responding to the distress of a stranger, a crying baby doll, and the mother was assessed. A series of hierarchical and logistic regressions were performed, and results indicated that infant fear predicted higher concerned awareness toward adults and higher personal distress reactions toward the mother. In addition, maternal responsivity predicted higher concerned attention and lower personal distress reactions toward the baby doll and mother. Findings also revealed several interaction effects to predict toddlers' empathy-related responding to distress.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2006	10	2					97	121		10.1207/s15327078in1002_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in1002_1													WOS:000240803400001
J	Soussignan, R; Nadel, J; Canet, P; Gerardin, P				Soussignan, Robert; Nadel, Jacqueline; Canet, Pierre; Gerardin, Priscille			Sensitivity to social contingency and positive emotion in 2-month-olds	INFANCY												This study was aimed at sorting out conflicting results in the literature concerning 2-month-olds' sensitivity to interpersonal contingency, and investigated the potential role of infants' positive emotion in contingency detection. Infants were randomly assigned to an experimental group (EG) that was presented an uninterrupted live-replay-live sequence of three 30-sec episodes of their mothers' communicative behavior using a double video TV paradigm, or to a control group (CG) that was presented an uninterrupted 90 sec of contingent maternal interactions. Infants of the EG grimaced more than infants of the CG only during the 2nd period of social exchange (replay vs. 2nd live period), but there was an increase of grimacing and a reduction in gazing during the 3rd period of televised interactions in infants of the CG. Each group was split into 2 subgroups a posteriori according to the presence or absence of smiling during the 1st contingent episode. Smiling infants of the EG reacted more negatively during the 2nd interaction period compared to other subgroups. These findings support the view that sensitivity, not fatigue or loss of interest to maternal stimulation, accounts for 2-month-olds' expressive changes during noncontingent maternal interactions; fatigue or loss of interest better explains the decline in attention and the increase of negative expressiveness during the last period of contingent interaction. The findings also suggest that the emotional climate of dyadic exchanges could be a contributing factor to infants' ability to detect the relations between their own actions and those of their social partners.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2006	10	2					123	144		10.1207/s15327078in1002_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in1002_2													WOS:000240803400002
J	Booth, AE				Booth, Amy E.			Object function and categorization in infancy: Two mechanisms of facilitation	INFANCY												Does function facilitate categorization by focusing infants' attention generally on all commonalities among objects or specifically on functionally relevant properties? After familiarization to a novel category, 18-month-olds selected another category member from a pair of previously unseen test objects. In Experiments I and 2, infants chose globally similar over functionally similar and novel test objects. Functionally similar and novel test objects were chosen equally. These data suggest that function facilitates categorization through a general attention-enhancing mechanism. However, when functions were more uniquely and transparently tied to object properties in Experiments 3 and 4, infants chose functionally similar over novel test objects. Globally and functionally similar test objects were chosen equally. Therefore, a specific attention-enhancing mechanism also sometimes supports categorization.

Neural correlates of human and monkey face processing in 9-month-old infants	INFANCY												Behavioral and electrophysiological evidence suggests a gradual, experience-dependent specialization of cortical face processing systems that takes place largely in the 1st year of life. To further investigate these findings, event-related potentials (ERPs) were collected from typically developing 9-month-old infants presented with pictures of familiar and unfamiliar monkey or human faces in 2 different orientations. Analyses revealed differential processing across changes in monkey and human faces. The N290 was greater for familiar compared to unfamiliar faces, regardless of species or orientation. In contrast, the P400 to unfamiliar faces was greater than to familiar faces, but only for the monkey condition. The P400 to human faces differentiated the orientation of both familiar and unfamiliar faces. These results suggest more specific processing of human compared to monkey faces in 9-month-olds.					nelson, charles/LBH-6397-2024	Scott, Lisa/0000-0002-8136-891X; Nelson, Charles/0000-0002-4723-247X													1525-0008	1532-7078					2006	10	2					171	186		10.1207/s15327078in1002_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in1002_4								36998330					WOS:000240803400004

Auditory stimuli were "Functor + Content Word" versus "Nonsense Functor + Content Word" sequences. Eight-, 11-, and 13-month-old infants heard both real functors and matched nonsense functors (prosodically analogous to their real counterparts but containing a segmental change). Results reveal that 13-month-olds recognized functors with attention to segmental detail. Eight-month-olds did not distinguish real versus nonsense functors. The performance of 11-month-olds fell in between that of the older and younger groups, consistent with an emerging recognition of real functors. The three age groups exhibited a clear developmental trend. We propose that in the earliest stages of vocabulary acquisition, function elements receive no segmentally detailed representations, but such representations are gradually constructed so that once vocabulary growth starts in earnest, fully specified functor representations are in place to support it.

In Experiment 1A, 5-day but not 1-day retention was disrupted if either or both elements of the context present during the retention test were novel. In Experiment 1B, 5-day retention was observed when only a single component of the training context, visual or auditory, was present. In Experiment 2, the retention test occurred at 14 days but it was preceded 24 hr earlier by a brief reactivation treatment. When the reactivation treatment consisted of reexposing the infant to the training crib bumpers and music, or just to the training music, it was not successful. Reactivation was successful when the reactivation treatment consisted of only the training crib bumpers. These results indicate that, in this paradigm, 3-month-old infants do not encode the elements of the context holistically and that, following forgetting, the visual contextual cues become dominant over the auditory contextual cues in facilitating retrieval.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2006	10	3					201	220		10.1207/s15327078in1003_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in1003_1													WOS:000242314400001

We recorded normal-hearing (NH) mothers speaking to their children as they typically would do at home and speaking to an adult experimenter. Nine infants (10-37 months) were hearing-impaired and had used a cochlear implant (CI) for 3 to 18 months. Eighteen NH infants and children were matched either by chronological age (10-37 months) or hearing experience (3-18 months) to the CI children. Prosodic characteristics such as fundamental frequency, utterance duration, and pause duration were measured across utterances in the speech samples. The results revealed that mothers use a typical infant-directed speech style when speaking to hearing-impaired children with CIs. The results also suggested that NH mothers speak with more similar vocal styles to NH children and hearing-impaired children with Cls when matched by hearing experience rather than chronological age. Thus, mothers are sensitive to hearing experience and linguistic abilities of their NH children as well as hearing-impaired children with Cls.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2006	10	3					221	240		10.1207/s15327078in1003_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in1003_2													WOS:000242314400002
J	Mattock, K; Burnham, D				Mattock, Karen; Burnham, Denis			Chinese and English infants' tone perception: Evidence for perceptual reorganization	INFANCY												Over half the world's population speaks a tone language, yet infant speech perception research has typically focused on consonants and vowels. Very young infants can discriminate a wide range of native and normative consonants and vowels, and then in a process of perceptual reorganization over the 1st year, discrimination of most normative speech sounds deteriorates. We investigated perceptual reorganization for tones by testing 6- and 9-month-old infants from tone (Chinese) and nontone (English) language environments for speech (lexical tone) and nonspeech (violin sound) tone discrimination in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Overall, Chinese infants performed equally well at 6 and 9 months for both speech and nonspeech tone discrimination. Conversely, English infants' discrimination of lexical tone declined between 6 and 9 months of age, whereas their nonspeech tone discrimination remained constant. These results indicate that the reorganization of tone perception is a function of the native language environment, and that this reorganization is linguistically based.

Participants included 84 mother-infant dyads (43 cigarette-exposed and 41 nonexposed) who were recruited after birth and assessed at 2 to 4 weeks of infant age. Results indicated that mothers who smoked during pregnancy had higher levels of maternal insensitivity (MI) and lower levels of maternal warmth (MW) during interactions with their infant even after controlling for demographics and pregnancy alcohol use. Maternal anxiety and hostility mediated the association between smoking and MI and maternal anger mediated the association between smoking and reduced MW. In addition, there was an interaction between infant gender and maternal smoking for MW with smokers displaying less warmth to boys during interactions.					; Schuetze, Pamela/AGL-7968-2022	Eiden, Rina/0000-0002-5303-3661; Schuetze, Pamela/0000-0001-9348-5788													1525-0008	1532-7078					2006	10	3					267	288		10.1207/s15327078in1003_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in1003_4								36101896					WOS:000242314400004

A study by four-dimensional (4D) ultrasonography	INFANCY												Using four-dimensional (41)) ultrasonography, arm and hand movements toward the face were examined in 27 human fetuses at 19 to 35 weeks of gestation, thereby enabling the continuous monitoring of their faces and other surface features such as the extremities. More than half of the observed arm movements resulted in the hand touching the mouth either directly or indirectly. Moreover, the fetuses opened their mouths before their hands came in contact with their mouths. Such fetal "anticipatory" behavior suggests the possibility that human fetuses perceive the manner in which they should move their hands to make contact with their mouths. Such movements are based on knowledge about intersensorimotor relations in their bodies.

To investigate the development and flexibility of this skill, we tested 12-month-olds on a different but analogous task. Infants watched as an adult made a toy animal use a particular action to get to an endpoint. In 1 condition there was a barrier that prevented a more straightforward action and so gave the actor no choice but to use the demonstrated action. In the other condition there was no barrier, so the actor had a free choice to use the demonstrated action or not. Twelve-month-olds showed the same pattern of results as in Gergely and colleagues' study: They copied the particular action demonstrated more often when the adult freely chose to use the action than when she was forced to use it. Twelve-month-olds, too, thus show an understanding of others' intentions as rational choices and can use this understanding in cultural learning contexts.

J	Moreno, AJ; Posada, GE; Goldyn, DT				Moreno, AJ; Posada, GE; Goldyn, DT			Presence and quality of touch influence coregulation in mother-infant dyads	INFANCY												The first major goal of this study was to determine whether touch would enhance mother-infant coregulation in ordinary, nonstressful face-to-face interactions. In an experimental manipulation of presence versus absence of touch in face-to-face interactions between 79 mothers and their 3.5-month-old infants, results indicated that when touch is prohibited, relaxed and mutually attuned coregulation (asymmetrical coregulation) decreases. Contrary to expectations, coactive and mutually attuned coregulation (symmetrical coregulation) increased during prohibited touch, but this finding was qualified by a significant interaction between touch and order. The second major goal of this study was to question the assumption that the presence of touch should exert uniform effects on mother-infant interactions despite likely individual differences in the way touch is practiced. We assessed affectionate touch and stimulating touch in the touch condition of the experiment. Results indicated that the decrease in symmetrical coregulation during touch was primarily explained by those dyads that practiced more affectionate and less stimulating touch, indicating that affectionate touch is inversely related and stimulating touch is directly related to infant activity level.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2006	9	1					1	20		10.1207/s15327078in0901_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0901_1													WOS:000234956700001

Work with adults has identified networks of brain areas involved in novelty detection, this study investigated electrophysiological correlates of detection of novelty and recognition of familiarity in 9-month-old infants, using event-related potentials (ERPs). Infants were familiarized with an event in the laboratory, then ERPs were recorded as they viewed repeated presentations of pictures of this familiar event and a novel event, along with single presentations of 30 trial-unique events. A middle-latency negative component was sensitive to degree of novelty, differing in amplitude and latency by stimulus condition and across repeated presentations. Long-latency slow-wave activity also related to stimulus condition. Findings have implications for our understanding of infants' detection of novel information and the processes that render the novel familiar.

After observing I wind-up toy animal move on its own and a second wind-up toy animal move passively by an experimenter's hand, infants looked reliably longer at the former object during a subsequent stationary test, providing evidence that infants learned and remembered the mapping of objects and their motions. In further experiments, infants learned the mapping for different animals and retained it over a 15-min delay, providing evidence that the learning is robust and infants' expectations about self-propelled motion are enduring. Further experiments suggested that infants' learning was less reliable when the self-propelled objects were novel or lacked faces, body parts, and articulated, biological motion. The findings are discussed in relation to infants' developing knowledge of object categories and capacity to learn about objects in the first year of life.																			1525-0008						2006	9	1					45	71		10.1207/s15327078in0901_3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0901_3													WOS:000234956700003
J	Bahrick, LE; Lickliter, R; Flom, R				Bahrick, LE; Lickliter, R; Flom, R			Up versus down: The role of intersensory redundancy in the development of infants' sensitivity to the orientation of moving objects	INFANCY												According to the intersensory redundancy hypothesis (IRH), during early development, perception of nonredundantly specified properties is facilitated in unimodal stimulation as compared with bimodal stimulation. Later in development, attention becomes more flexible and infants can detect nonredundantly specified properties in both unimodal and bimodal stimulation. This study tested these predictions by assessing the development of infants' sensitivity to the orientation of an object striking a surface, information that is nonredundantly specified in visual and in audiovisual stimulation. Infants of 3, 5, and 8 months were habituated to unimodal visual or bimodal, synchronous, audiovisual films of a hammer tapping a rhythm in I of 2 orientations (upward vs. downward). Results demonstrated an Age x Condition interaction, where younger infants (3 and 5 months) detected the orientation change in unimodal but not bimodal stimulation, whereas older infants (8 months) detected the change in both types of stimulation. Further, in a control study, 3-month-olds detected the orientation change when bimodal stimulation was asynchronous, demonstrating that temporal synchrony impaired performance in the bimodal condition. These findings converge with those of prior studies and support predictions of the IRH.

Young infants' use of auditory information to individuate objects	INFANCY												Most research on object individuation in infants has focused on the visual domain. Yet the problem of object individuation is not unique to the visual system, but shared by other sensory modalities. This research examined 4.5-month-old infants' capacity to use auditory information to individuate objects. Infants were presented with events in which they heard 2 distinct sounds, separated by a temporal gap, emanate from behind a wide screen; the screen was then lowered to reveal I or 2 objects. Longer looking to the 1- than 2-object display was taken as evidence that the infants (a) interpreted the auditory event as involving 2 objects and (b) found the presence of only I object when the screen was lowered unexpected. The results indicated that the infants used sounds produced by rattles, but not sounds produced by an electronic keyboard, as the basis for object individuation (Experiments I and 2). Data collected with adult participants revealed that adults are also more sensitive to rattle sounds than electronic tones. A final experiment assessed conditions under which young infants attend to rattle sounds (Experiment 3). Collectively, the outcomes of these experiments suggest that infants and adults are more likely to use some sounds than others as the basis for individuating objects. We propose that these results reflect a processing bias to attend to sounds that reveal something about the physical properties of an object-sounds that are obviously linked to object structure-when determining object identity.

Cotton-top Tamarins' (<i>Saguinus oedipus</i>) expectations about occluded objects:: A dissociation between looking and reaching tasks	INFANCY												Recent work with human infants and toddlers suggests a dissociation between performance on looking and reaching tasks. Specifically, infants appear to generate accurate representations of occluded objects and their actions when tested in expectancy violation looking tasks but often fail to use this information when reaching for occluded objects. We explore a similar dissociation in cotton-top tamarin monkeys (Saguinus oedipus). We presented adult tamarins with an event in which a piece of food rolled behind an occluder and into a solid barrier. In Experiment 1, subjects were required to retrieve the hidden food using the location of the solid barrier. Like human toddlers, adult tamarins failed to take into account solidity information when reaching for an invisibly displaced object. In Experiments 2 and 3, we presented subjects with expectancy violation looking versions of the same solidity problem using an identical apparatus and setup. We presented subjects with an event in which a piece of food appeared to roll unexpectedly through a solid barrier or stopped at the appropriate spot. Although tamarins failed to locate the food in Experiment 1, the same subjects successfully detected violations of solidity in these 2 looking studies. This performance dissociation is discussed in light of similar dissociations in human toddlers and other primate species.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2006	9	2					147	171		10.1207/s15327078in0902_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0902_4													WOS:000237766400004

Two rhesus monkeys were tested in a touch screen task where the variability of elements within each visual array was systematically varied by allowing elements to vary in color, size, shape, or any combination of these dimensions. We found no evidence of a cost (or benefit) in accuracy or reaction time when monkeys were tested with stimuli that were heterogeneous in color, size, or shape. This was true even though both monkeys experienced extended initial training with arrays that were homogeneous in the color, shape, and size of elements. The implications of this finding for the mechanisms that monkeys use to represent and compare numerosities are discussed.					cantlon, jessica/A-2699-2010														1525-0008	1532-7078					2006	9	2					173	189		10.1207/s15327078in0902_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0902_5													WOS:000237766400005

Self-awareness in human and chimpanzee infants: What is measured and what is meant by the mark and mirror test?	INFANCY												The objective study of self-recognition, with a mirror and a mark applied to the face, was conducted independently by Gallup (1970) for use with chimpanzees and monkeys, and by Amsterdam (1972) for use with infant humans. Comparative psychologists have followed the model (and assumptions) set by Gallup, whereas developmental psychologists have followed a different model (e.g., Lewis & Brooks-Gunn, 1979). This article explores the assumptions in the definitions and methods of self-recognition assessments in the 30 years since these initial studies, and charts the divergence between the developmental mark test and the comparative mark test. Two new studies, 1 with infant chimpanzees and I with infant humans, illustrate a reconciliation of the 2 approaches. Overt application of the mark, or other procedures related to how the mark is discovered, did not enhance mirror self-recognition. In contrast, maternal scaffolding appears to enhance performance, perhaps by eliciting well-rehearsed verbal responses (i.e., naming self). When comparable testing procedures and assessment criteria are used, chimpanzee and human infants perform comparably. A combined developmental comparative approach allows us to suggest that mirror self-recognition may be based on a specific aspect of mental representation, the cognitive ability to symbolize.

We focused on spontaneous activity during the night partly because sleeping behavior constitutes an essential part of the infants' activity. Observation during the night also had the advantage of keeping the influence of the mothers' activity as well as the environmental stimulation constant throughout the observation period. We report several interesting findings. Behavioral states defined through overt features such as open or closed eyes were variable during the night, with the rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep patterns alternating much as they do in human infants. Although crying is one of the distinctive behavioral states in the case of human infants, the chimpanzee infants did not cry like humans. Suckling behavior was often accompanied by open eyes until the end of the first 2 months. Thereafter, suckling with the eyes closed became more prominent. Although there were no explicit stimuli, the newborns showed neonatal smiling with the eyes closed during REM sleep periods. However, neonatal smiling disappeared within the first 2 months and was replaced by social smiling with open eyes. Taken together, the results suggest a strong similarity between human infants and chimpanzee infants in terms of developmental changes in spontaneous activities at around 2 months of age.

J	Weiss, DJ; Newport, EL				Weiss, Daniel J.; Newport, Elissa L.			Mechanisms underlying language acquisition: Benefits from a comparative approach	INFANCY												One of the longstanding issues in language research has been the extent to which the mechanisms underlying language acquisition are uniquely human. The primary goal of this article is to introduce the reader to some of the recent developments in comparative language research that have shed new light on this issue. To appreciate the significance of the new developments, we begin with a brief historical overview of language studies that have adopted a comparative approach, and then discuss a subset of the relevant theoretical accounts that seek to explain why humans are the only species capable of acquiring language. We next focus on findings from behavioral studies comparing the performance of human infants and adults with nonhuman primates on tests that tap the perceptual and learning mechanisms that are fundamental to language acquisition. We argue that in cases where the behavioral data appear similar across populations, there is a need to investigate the underlying computational abilities and units of analysis to correctly specify the degree to which the mechanisms are truly shared or are uniquely specified.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2006	9	2					241	257		10.1207/s15327078in0902_8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0902_8													WOS:000237766400008

Attention to maternal multimodal naming by 6-to 8-month-old infants and learning of word-object relations	INFANCY												We examined whether mothers' use of temporal synchrony between spoken words and moving objects, and infants' attention to object naming, predict infants' learning of word-object relations. Following 5 min of free play, 24 mothers taught their 6- to 8-month-olds the names of 2 toy objects, Gow and Chi, during a 3-min play episode. Infants were then tested for their word mapping. The videotaped episodes were coded for mothers' object naming and infants' attention to different naming types. Results indicated that mothers' use of temporal synchrony and infants' attention during play covaried with infants' word-mapping ability. Specifically, infants who switched eye gaze from mother to object most frequently during naming learned the word-object relations. The findings suggest that maternal naming and infants' word-mapping abilities are bidirectionally related. Variability in infants' attention to maternal multimodal naming explains the variability in early lexical-mapping development.

These studies extend this line of research to a 3-argument structure: An agent gives an object to a recipient. We conducted 4 experiments in a novelty-preference paradigm. Infants were habituated to videotaped sequences of a puppet giving a flower to another puppet. In the test phase, the puppets' spatial positions were switched, and infants alternately saw role-reversal and direction-reversal trials. Results indicate that 10.5- and 12-month-olds but not 9-month-olds selectively encoded the change of action role (agent-recipient) over a change in the spatiotemporal properties of the interaction and that action role encoding was specific to intentional relations in a 3-argument structure. Thus, infants at the end of their 1st year seem to be sensitive to movement cues that specify intentional relations between an agent and a recipient.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2006	9	3					289	311		10.1207/s15327078in0903_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0903_2								33412679					WOS:000237902800002

The contingent responsiveness for smiles and vocalizations, while attending to the partner, was assessed for each partner in both interactions. For smiles and for vocalizations, infants were less responsive to the stranger relative to the mother when the stranger's contingent responsiveness was either more contingent or less contingent than that of the mother. Results are supportive of the hypothesis that young infants develop sensitivities to levels of social contingency present in their maternal interactions, which influence their responsiveness to others.																			1525-0008						2006	9	3					313	325		10.1207/s15327078in0903_3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0903_3								33412678					WOS:000237902800003

INFANCY												Previous research has shown that children as young as 2 can learn words from 3rd-party conversations (Akhtar, Jipson, & Callanan, 2001). The focus of this study was to determine whether younger infants could learn a new word through overhearing. Novel object labels were introduced to 18-month-old infants in 1 of 2 conditions: directly by an experimenter or in the context of overhearing the experimenter use the word while interacting with another adult. The findings suggest that, when memory demands are not too high, 18-month-old infants can learn words through overhearing.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2006	9	3					327	339		10.1207/s15327078in0903_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0903_4								33412677					WOS:000237902800004

Nineteen-month-olds' understanding of the conventionality of object labels versus desires	INFANCY												We assessed 19-month-olds' appreciation of the conventional nature of object labels versus desires. Infants played a finding game with an experimenter who stated her intention to find the referent of a novel word (word group), to find an object she wanted (desire group), or simply to look in a box (control group). A 2nd experimenter then administered a comprehension task to assess infants' tendency to extend information to a 2nd person who was not present at the time of learning. Results indicate that infants chose the target object when the 2nd experimenter asked for the referent of the novel label but not when she requested the referent of her desire. These findings demonstrate that 19-month-olds understand that words are conventional, but desires are not.

J	Valenza, E; Zulian, L; Leo, I				Valenza, E; Zulian, L; Leo, I			The role of perceptual skills in newborns' perception of partly occluded objects	INFANCY												This study explored whether the reported inability of newborns to perceive object unity could result from the limited abilities of newborns to recognize the correspondence between 2 stimuli that were identical except for the presence or absence of an occluder. Five experiments were carried out using 4 visual habituation technique. The results of Experiment I indicated that newborns were capable of recognizing the perceptual correspondence between a nonoccluded and an occluded form. More intriguing, the outcomes of Experiments 2, 3, and 4 suggested that newborns find a partly occluded form to be more similar to a completely unoccluded form than to an unoccluded form containing a gap. Finally, even if newborns are able to perceive the correspondence between a partly occluded object and a complete form, the presence of this skill does not appear sufficient to imply the ability to manifest veridical object unity perception at birth (Experiment 5).

Participants were 60 racially and ethnically diverse, inner-city men and their 6- to 11-month-old infants. Father-infant interactions were videotaped during semistructured free play in participants' homes. The quality of men's interactions with their infants was assessed using Likert ratings of their responsive-didactic and. negative-overbearing behaviors. Men engaged in significantly more responsive-didactic behaviors than negative-overbearing behaviors. A cumulative score of protective demographic factors (i.e., men residing with their infants, being married, completing high school, and obtaining income above the sample's median level) and men's experiences of childhood acceptance from their fathers uniquely predicted their responsive-didactic behaviors. Men's relationships with their partners were homogeneously strong and unrelated to fathering behaviors. This study builds on extant literature by providing a broader conceptualization of father-infant relationships and applying observational methods to the study of fathering in minority, low-income men.

Eighty-one mothers completed the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. A retrospective evaluation of labor pain was performed using the Visual Ana:log Scale at 2 days postpartum. Six weeks after birth the mothers were visited at home, completed measures of anxiety and depression, and were observed during a free play session with the infant. The mother's tendency to catastrophize pain predicted lower levels of mother-infant reciprocity at 6 weeks, controlling for maternal age, education, parity, epidural analgesia, pain perception, anxiety, and depression. Trait anxiety was related to lower maternal sensitivity. The mother's tendency to catastrophize pain was discussed in relation to the personality trait of exaggerated emotional perception of pain and its potential interference with the formation of the mother-infant relationship.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2005	8	1					43	62		10.1207/s15327078in0801_3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0801_3								33412661					WOS:000231579000003

Infant performance on a Contingency/extinction task was studied following a caregiver demonstration of the contingency on varied reinforcement schedules. Infants who observed caregivers receive any reinforcing stimulation in pretraining decreased responding over their own acquisition period, possibly because they began to habituate to the reinforcer. In extinction, infants who, observed caregivers receive partial reinforcement in pretraining were more persistent in responding than others. This suggested that direct experience with partial reinforcement is not needed for greater penistence in extinction. These studies revealed details of social learning in the 1st year.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2005	8	1					63	80		10.1207/s15327078in0801_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0801_4								33412659					WOS:000231579000004

Results from an imitation task indicated that 18-month-olds are better able to differentiate between intentional and accidental actions than 14-month-olds. Although there was no relation between infants' performance on the intention task and their general productive vocabulary, internal state language production at 30 months was predicted by infants' ability to differentiate between intentional and accidental actions about a year earlier. These findings shed light on the developmental progression of infants' concept of intention, as well as on the continuity between infants' understanding of intentional action and their ability to use internal state words.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2005	8	1					91	100		10.1207/s15327078in0801_6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0801_6								33412663					WOS:000231579000006

Middle ear function was assessed following each perception test using tympanometry. Perceptual performance was compared across 3 infant groups: (a) history-negative, infants with normal middle ear function who had never received medical treatment for OME; (b) history-positive, infants with normal middle ear function who received medical treatment for prior episodes of OME; and (c) MEE, infants presenting tympanograms indicating middle ear effusion on the day of testing. History-negative infants performed significantly better than MEE infants in both test sessions. History-negative infants also performed significantly better than history-positive infants in the 2nd test session. Findings suggest that OME has a negative impact on infant phonetic discrimination that may persist even after middle ear function has returned to normal.

Resolving this debate has important implications for perception-action dissociations in this domain of object knowledge. In Study 1, 12-month-old infants' ability to perceive the causal structure of a cloth-pulling sequence was assessed via a habituation paradigm. After seeing an event in which a supported toy was moved by pulling a cloth that it sat on, 12-month-old infants demonstrated longer looking to events that violated the causal structure of this sequence than to events that preserved the causal structure but varied other perceptual features of the event. Studies 2 and 3 investigated 10-month-olds' interpretations of means-end support sequences using both a habituation paradigm and a task that assessed infants' own means-end actions. Whereas 10-month-olds failed to demonstrate an understanding of the causal structure when tested using a flat cloth as the support (Study 2), sensitivity to this structure was apparent when a rectangular box was the support. These patterns were evident in both action and perception (Study 3). Moreover, individual variation in action task performance was related to visual habituation performance. The results are discussed with respect to the relation between action and perception in infancy.

In Experiment 1, 9-month-olds viewed an object, a photograph of the object, and 2 flat, nonpictorial displays. On average, they reached for the photograph and nonpictorial displays with their hands approximately horizontal and close to the display surfaces, but reached for the object with their hands oriented obliquely and at significantly higher heights. The infants also exhibited similar behaviors when touching the photograph and nonpictorial displays. In Experiment 2, 9-month-olds exhibited similar behaviors when touching a photograph of an object and a photograph of textured carpet. The results of both experiments suggest that 9-month-olds treat photographs of objects as 2-dimensional surfaces and not as graspable objects.

Facial expressivity from 4 to 12 months	INFANCY												Differentiation models contend that the organization of facial expressivity increases during infancy. Accordingly, infants are believed to exhibit increasingly specific facial expressions in response to stimuli as a function of development. This study tested this hypothesis in a sample of 151 infants (83 boys and 68 girls) observed in 4 situations (tickle, sour taste, arm restraint, and masked stranger) at 4 and 12 months of age. Three of the 4 situations showed evidence of increasing specificity over time. In response to fickle, the number of infants exhibiting joy expressions increased and the number exhibiting interest, surprise, and surprise blends decreased from 4 to 12 months. In tasting a sour substance, more infants exhibited disgust and fewer exhibited joy and interest expressions, and fear and surprise blends over time. For arm restraint, more infants exhibited anger expressions and anger blends and fewer exhibited interest and surprise expressions and surprise blends over time. In response to a masked stranger, however, no evidence of increased specificity was found. Overall, these findings suggest that infants increasingly exhibit particular expressions in response to specific stimuli during the 1st year of life. These data provide partial support for the hypothesis that facial expressivity becomes increasingly organized over time.

J	Dannemiller, JL				Dannemiller, JL			Motion popout in selective visual orienting at 4.5 but not at 2 months in human infants	INFANCY												The effect of element density on selective orienting was examined in 2 experiments with 2- and 4.5-month-old infants. Selective visual orienting to a singleton oscillating target that appeared with other static bars was used to study the effects of element density. Increasing the set size and density of the static bars decreased selective orienting to the moving target in the 2-month-old infants, but it increased selective orienting in the 4.5-month-olds despite the fact that the overall levels of correct orienting to the target were titrated to be the same at the 2 ages. Thus, density affected the selectivity of visual orienting to movement at these 2 ages differently with popout being evident at the older age. In the 2nd experiment, motion popout for the 4.5-month-old infants was replicated using oscillating targets that had the same peak and mean speeds but different temporal frequencies and amplitudes of oscillation. Increases in the efficiency of perceptual grouping of similar elements between 2 and 4.5 months of age could overcome the lateral masking effects of increasing element density seen at the lower end of this age range.																			1525-0008						2005	8	3					201	216		10.1207/s15327078in0803_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0803_1													WOS:000233861300001
J	von Hofsten, C; Dahlström, E; Fredriksson, Y				von Hofsten, C; Dahlström, E; Fredriksson, Y			12-month-old infants' perception of attention direction in static video images	INFANCY												Twelve-month-old infants' ability to perceive gaze direction in static video images was investigated. The images showed a woman who performed attention-directing actions by looking or pointing toward I of 4 objects positioned in front of her (2 on each side). When the model just pointed at the objects, she looked straight ahead, and when she just looked, her hands were hidden below the tabletop. An eye movement system (TOBII) was used to register the gaze of the participants. We found that the infants clearly discriminated the gaze directions to the objects. There was no tendency to mix up the 2 object positions, located 10 degrees apart, on the same side of the model. The infants spent more time looking at the attended objects than the unattended ones and they shifted gaze more often from the face of the model to the attended object than to the unattended objects. Pointing did not significantly increase the infants' tendency to move gaze to the attended object, irrespective of whether the pointing gesture was accompanied by looking or not. In all conditions the infants spent most of the time looking at the model's face. This tendency was especially noticeable in the pointing-only condition and the condition where the model just looked straight ahead.																			1525-0008						2005	8	3					217	231		10.1207/s15327078in0803_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0803_2													WOS:000233861300002

To address these issues, 60 infants (20 each at 6, 8, and 10 months of age) were presented hard and soft objects on tabletop surfaces, which varied in terms of their material properties. Tabletop surfaces were either liquid, discontinuous, flexible, or rigid. Results indicated that infants explored the objects, surfaces, and their interactions selectively, tailoring their manual actions to the material properties of the objects or surfaces. In some instances, selectivity increased with age. The implications of these findings for understanding the origins of problem solving and tool use are considered.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2005	8	3					233	252		10.1207/s15327078in0803_3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0803_3													WOS:000233861300003
J	Carpenter, M; Tomasello, M; Striano, T				Carpenter, M; Tomasello, M; Striano, T			Role reversal imitation and language in typically developing infants and children with autism	INFANCY												Three types of role reversal imitation were investigated in typically developing 12-and 18-month-old infants and in children with autism and other developmental delays. Many typically developing infants at both ages engaged in each of the 2 types of dyadic, body-oriented role reversal imitation: self-self reversals, in which the adult acted on herself and the child then acted on himself, and other-other reversals. in which the adult acted on the child and the child then acted back on the adult. However, 12-month-olds had more difficulty than 18-month-olds with triadic, object-mediated role reversals involving interactions around objects. There was little evidence of any type of role reversal imitation in children with autism. Positive relations were found between role reversal imitation and various measures of language development for 18-month-olds and children with autism.

This study asks whether similar facial movements influence adult perceptions of emotional intensity in both infant positive (smile) and negative (cry face) facial expressions. Ninety-five college students rated a series of naturally occurring and digitally edited images of infant facial expressions. Naturally occurring smiles and cry faces involving the co-occurrence of greater lip movement, mouth opening, and eye constriction, were rated as expressing stronger positive and negative emotion, respectively, than expressions without these 3 features. Ratings of digitally edited expressions indicated that eye constriction contributed to higher ratings of positive emotion in smiles (i.e., in Duchenne smiles) and greater eye constriction contributed to higher ratings of negative emotion in cry faces. Stronger mouth opening contributed to higher ratings of arousal in both smiles and cry faces. These findings indicate a set of similar facial movements are linked to perceptions of greater emotional intensity, whether the movements occur in positive or negative infant emotional expressions. This proposal is discussed with reference to discrete, componential, and dynamic systems theories of emotion.

J	Kloos, H; Keen, R				Kloos, H; Keen, R			An exploration of toddlers' problems in a search task	INFANCY												Toddlers show a surprising lack of knowledge about solidity when they are asked to search for a ball that rolled behind a screen and stopped at a barrier whose top was visible above the screen. They search incorrectly, failing to take into account the position of the barrier. This study examined details of this failure by simplifying the task in 2 ways: by using a search task that did not require children to understand solidity, and by using a prediction task that did not require children to conduct a search. For the prediction task, children had to predict where a ball was going to stop when a barrier intersected its trajectory. Children 2.0 and 2.5 years old were able to conduct a simple search and could predict, to some extent, where the ball was going to stop when the barrier was fully visible. Children did not show this predictive knowledge when the barrier was partially occluded by the screen.

J	Nichols, KE; Fox, N; Mundy, P				Nichols, KE; Fox, N; Mundy, P			Joint attention, self-recognition, and neurocognitive function in toddlers	INFANCY												Recent studies have attempted to understand the processes involved in joint attention because of its relevance to both atypical and normal development. Data from a recent study of young children with autism suggests that performance on a delay nonmatch to sample (DNMS) task associated with ventromedial prefrontal functions, but not an A-not-B/delayed response task associated with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, was related to joint attention skills (Dawson et al., 2002). Recent research also suggests that joint attention is associated with dorsalmedial brain systems linked to self-monitoring (Mundy, 2003). This study investigated the relations among joint attention, DNMS, and self-recognition performance in a longitudinal study of 39 normally developing toddlers from 14 to 18 months. The results indicated that development on the DNMS and self-recognition tasks, but not a means end task, predicted joint attention at 18 months. Further analysis showed that the model was only significant for initiating joint attention (IJA). The implications of these results for the neuro-development of IJA are discussed.

J	Thiessen, ED; Hill, EA; Saffran, JR				Thiessen, ED; Hill, EA; Saffran, JR			Infant-directed speech facilitates word segmentation	INFANCY												There are reasons to believe that infant-directed (ID) speech may make language acquisition easier for infants. However, the effects of ID speech on infants' learning remain poorly understood. The experiments reported here assess whether ID speech facilitates word segmentation from fluent speech. One group of infants heard a set of nonsense sentences spoken with intonation contours characteristic of adult-directed (AD) speech, and the other group heard the same sentences spoken with intonation contours characteristic of ID speech. In both cases, the only cue to word boundaries was the statistical structure of the speech. Infants were able to distinguish words from syllable sequences spanning word boundaries after exposure to ID speech but not after hearing AD speech. These results suggest that ID speech facilitates word segmentation and may be useful for other aspects of language acquisition as well. Issues of direction of preference in preferential listening paradigms are also considered.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2005	7	1					53	71		10.1207/s15327078in0701_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0701_5								33430544					WOS:000227601900005

Following Csibra, Biro, Koos, and Gergely (2003), infants were habituated to a simple chasing event involving animated balls, and at test saw 2 possible endings: either I ball caught the other or failed to do so. Two controls were added to the previous work. First, the total amount of motion was controlled in the test endings; second, the endings were paired with a nonchasing beginning to ensure that behavior at test reflected representation of the event beginning itself. The results replicated Csibra et al.'s finding that infants look longer at the noncatching ending following the chasing beginning; moreover, infants showed no preference for either ending following the no-chasing beginning. This study supports the claim that infants can calculate the rational ending of a goal-directed motion event.					wagner, laura/HPE-4983-2023	Wagner, Laura/0000-0001-8557-4844													1525-0008						2005	7	1					73	83		10.1207/s15327078in0701_6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0701_6								33430542					WOS:000227601900006

In each experiment, 4- or 6-month-old infants were familiarized with a collection of dogs or cats and then their response to novel dogs and cats was assessed. In Experiment 1, 4-month-old infants responded to the exclusive distinction of dogs or cats when tested in a paired-comparison task. In Experiments 2 and 3, 6-month-old infants, but not 4-month-old infants, responded to this same distinction in a successive presentation task, even when the amount of familiarization was equated to that of the paired comparison task. Therefore, familiarization with a particular set of stimuli does not induce infants to respond to a single category but rather they respond to different categories depending on features of the task.

The head-turn preference study was used to investigate the nature of English-learners' representations of iambic word onsets. Fifty-four 10.5-month-olds were familiarized to passages containing the nonsense iambic word forms ginome and tupong. Following familiarization, infants were either tested on familiar (ginome and tupong) or near-familiar (pinome and bupong) versus unfamiliar (kidar and mafoos) words. Infants in the familiar test group (familiar vs. unfamiliar) oriented significantly longer to familiar than unfamiliar test items, whereas infants in the near-familiar test group (near-familiar vs. unfamiliar) oriented equally long to near-familiar and unfamiliar test items. Our results provide evidence that infants retain fairly detailed representations of unstressed syllables and therefore support the hypothesis that infants use phonotactic cues to find words in fluent speech.

In this technique, spontaneous preferences and familiarized (postfamiliarization) preferences are measured with the same stimulus pairs under closely parallel conditions. A variety of systematic stimulus variations were used in 16-week-old infants to explore the interrelations among spontaneous preferences, familiarized preferences, and familiarization (novelty) effects. Infants were exposed to pairs of 10 degrees red and blue disks of varying colorimetric purity generated on a video monitor. Pairs of disks were identified for which spontaneous preferences were balanced at about 50-50 or unbalanced at about 75-25, and the magnitudes of familiarized preferences were determined. When spontaneous preferences were balanced at 50-50, novelty effects increased with increasing chromatic separation between the 2 stimuli, showing the independence of these variables. When spontaneous preferences were unbalanced, novelty effects were asymmetrical, being large after familiarization to the spontaneously preferred stimulus, but small or nonexistent after familiarization to the spontaneously nonpreferred stimulus. The potential uses of combined spontaneous preference and novelty preference techniques are discussed.

J	Witherington, DC				Witherington, DC			The development of prospective grasping control between 5 and 7 months: A longitudinal study	INFANCY												By 7 months, infants, when reaching for an object, visually guide their grasp by preorienting their hands to match the object's orientation. Evidence at earlier ages, however, for prospective grasp control via anticipatory hand orientation is mixed. This study examined longitudinally the development of anticipatory hand orientation in 15 infants, seen every 3 weeks between 5 and 7.5 months. On each visit, infants were given 8 trials of reaching for an object oriented vertically and horizontally. Hand orientation at the first point of contact, prior to any tactile feedback, indexed infant prospective grasp. Between 5 and 7 months, infants showed evidence for qualitative transition in prospective control of grasp, supporting the contention that control of grasp shifts from being based on tactual feedback to being visually and therefore prospectively based. Implications for how prospective grasp emerges developmentally are discussed.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2005	7	2					143	161		10.1207/s15327078in0702_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0702_2								33430547					WOS:000228911800002

Generally, younger infants appear to have more difficulty discriminating a change in the vocal properties of ID speech when they are accompanied by faces. Forty 4-month-old infants were tested using either an infant-controlled habituation procedure (Experiment 1) or a fixed-trial habituation procedure (Experiment 2). The prediction was that the infant-controlled habituation procedure would be a more sensitive measure of infant attention to complex displays. The results indicated that 4-month-old infants discriminated voice changes in dynamic face + voice displays depending on the order in which they were viewed during the infant-controlled habituation procedure. In contrast, no evidence of discrimination was found in the fixed-trial procedure. The findings suggest that the selection of experimental methodology plays a significant role in the empirical observations of infant perceptual abilities.

J	Gómez, R; Maye, J				Gómez, R; Maye, J			The developmental trajectory of nonadjacent dependency learning	INFANCY												We investigated the developmental trajectory of nonadjacent dependency learning in an artificial language. Infants were exposed to 1 of 2 artificial languages with utterances of the form [aXc or bXd] (Grammar 1) or [aXd or bXc] (Grammar 2). In both languages, the grammaticality of an utterance depended on the relation between the 1st and 3rd elements, whereas the intervening element varied freely. High variability of the middle element is known to contribute to perception of nonadjacent dependencies (Gomez, 2002), but the developmental trajectory of such learning is unknown. Experiment 1 replicated the study of Gomez with a younger age group and a more subtle variability manipulation. Twelve-month-olds failed to track nonadjacent dependencies under conditions tested here (Experiments 2a and 2b), but by 15 months, infants are beginning to track this structure (Experiment 3). Such learning has implications for understanding how infants might begin to acquire similar structure in natural language.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2005	7	2					183	206		10.1207/s15327078in0702_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0702_4								33430549					WOS:000228911800004

This experiment extends this literature by examining the effects of adults' affective expression on 7-month-olds' gaze following. The effects of 3 affective expressions-happy, sad, and neutral-on 7-month-olds' frequency of gaze following were examined. The results indicated that infants more frequently followed the gaze of an adult posing a neutral expression than that of an adult posing either a happy or a sad expression. The infants also looked proportionately longer toward the indicated target when the adult's expression was neutral. The results are interpreted in terms of infants' flexibility of attention.

We used a sensory preconditioning paradigm and a deferred imitation task to assess if 3-month-olds formed a latent association between 2 objects (S-1, S-2) that they merely saw together. Because infants cannot perform the imitation task until 6 months, we maintained the latent memory with periodic reminders until then, when we modeled the target actions on S, and tested them with S-2 24 hr later. At 6 months of age, infants who had seen S-1 and S-2 paired (but not unpaired) deferred imitation on S-2, confirming that they had associated the objects 3 months earlier. In addition, 3-month-olds who saw the objects paired and then saw the target actions modeled on S, for 60 sec also recalled and imitated them on S-2 3 months later, at 6 months of age. These data reveal that latent learning by very young infants is both extensive and enduring and document that the knowledge base begins to form early in life, long before infants are able to express what they know.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2005	7	3					243	262		10.1207/s15327078in0703_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0703_2								33430559					WOS:000230941600002
J	Barr, R; Rovee-Collier, C; Campanella, J				Barr, R; Rovee-Collier, C; Campanella, J			Retrieval protracts deferred imitation by 6-month-olds	INFANCY												Past research using a deferred imitation task has shown that 6-month-olds remember a 3-part action sequence for only I day. The concept of a time window suggests that there is a limited period within which additional information can be integrated with a prior memory. Its width tracks the forgetting function of the memory. This study asked if retrieving the memory of the modeled actions at the end of the time window protracts its retention, if the type of retrieval (active or passive) differentially influences retention, and if the retrieval delay influences its specificity. In Experiment 1, 6-month-olds either imitated the modeled actions (active retrieval group) or merely watched them modeled again (passive retrieval group) I day after the original demonstration. Both groups showed deferred imitation after 10 days. In Experiment 2, 6-month-olds who repeatedly retrieved the memory at or near the end of the time window deferred imitation for 2.5 months. In Experiment 3, 6-month-olds spontaneously generalized imitation late in the time window after I prior retrieval, whether it was active or passive. These studies reveal that the retention benefit of multiple retrievals late in the time window is huge. Because most retrievals are undoubtedly latent, the contribution of repeated events to the growth of the knowledge base early in infancy has been greatly underestimated.

Adolph's (2002) research on infants' perception of slope and gap traversability suggests that learning to avoid falling down is highly specific to the postural context in which it occurs. Infants, for example, who have learned to avoid crossing risky slopes while crawling must learn anew such avoidance when they start walking. Do newly walking infants avoid crossing the drop-off of the visual cliff? Twenty prewalking but experienced crawling infants were compared with 20 similarly aged newly walking infants on their reactions to the visual cliff. Newly walking infants avoided moving onto the cliff's deep side even more consistently than did the prewalking crawlers. Thus, in the context of drop-offs in visual texture, our results show that once avoidance of drop-offs is established under conditions of crawling, it is developmentally maintained once infants begin walking.

Two hundred fifty-two mothers in Argentina, Italy, and the United States completed vocabulary checklists for their 20-month-old children. Individual variability was substantial within each linguistic community. Minimal cross-linguistic differences were found in children's vocabulary size; however, differences among languages in the composition of children's vocabularies appeared possibly related to cultural valuing of different categories of words. Ecological setting differences within cultures appeared in children's vocabulary size, even when the composition of children's vocabularies was examined: Children living in urban areas were reported by their mothers to say significantly more words than children living in rural areas, particularly for Argentine and U. S. children. Girls had consistently larger vocabularies than boys. These findings are discussed in terms of contextual and child factors that together influence first language learning.

J	Agnetta, B; Rochat, P				Agnetta, B; Rochat, P			Imitative games by 9-, 14-, and 18-month-old infants	INFANCY												Two experiments used a mutual imitation paradigm to assess 9-, 14-, and 18-month-old infants' developing understanding of intentions in others. In the first study, I experimenter imitated the infants' actions, and another experimenter performed contingent but different actions on an identical toy. From 9 months of age, infants show discrimination between the mimicking and the contingent experimenter. In a second study, same-age groups of infants faced either an experimenter mimicking their actions on an identical object or the object mimicking them independently of any manual contact by the experimenter. Only 14- and 18-month-olds showed discrimination between the 2 conditions, this discrimination correlating with infants' relative ability to follow gaze and points in triadic exchanges. These results are interpreted as demonstrating important developmental changes between 9 and 14 months in the construal of others as intentional.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2004	6	1					1	36		10.1207/s15327078in0601_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0601_1													WOS:000224663700001

The relations between depressed and well mothers' accuracy at interpreting babies' facial expressions and the quality of the mothers' interactions with their infants were examined. In partial support of our hypotheses, depressed mothers' level of depressive symptoms was associated with less accuracy, especially regarding positive emotions. Contrary to expectations, depressed mothers did not differ from well mothers in terms of their emotion accuracy. Furthermore, depressed mothers' accuracy at interpreting infants' emotions was not significantly related to the quality of their interaction with their infants; in contrast, well mothers' accuracy for infants' negative emotions was associated with better interaction quality. These findings provide new information about depressed mothers' emotional interpretations and their parenting. The different pattern of findings for depressed and well mothers suggests that other mediating factors are important, which are discussed.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2004	6	1					37	55		10.1207/s15327078in0601_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0601_2													WOS:000224663700002
J	Hart, SL; Carrington, HA; Tronick, EZ; Carroll, SR				Hart, SL; Carrington, HA; Tronick, EZ; Carroll, SR			When infants lose exclusive maternal attention: Is it jealousy?	INFANCY												To characterize infant reactions to jealousy evocation, 94 6-month-olds and their mothers were videotaped in an episode where the mothers directed positive attention toward a lifelike doll, and in 2 contrasting interactions: face-to-face play and a still-face perturbation. Cross-context comparisons of affects and behaviors revealed that jealousy evocation responses were distinguished by diminished joy and heightened anger and intensity of negative emotionality, comparable to levels displayed during the still-face episode; heightened sadness, with durations exceeding those displayed during still-face exposure; and an approach response consisting of interest, looks at mother, and diminished distancing, which was more pronounced than that demonstrated during play. Infants' heightened anger and sadness during jealousy evocation correlated with heightened maternal sensitivity and dyadic vocal turn-taking, respectively, during play; and infants' diminished joy and interest during jealousy evocation were associated with heightened maternal withdrawal and intrusiveness, respectively, during play. Both fear and mother-directed gaze were greater in girls. The discussion argues for interpreting the infant's mixed and agitated reaction to jealousy evocation as evidence of jealousy.

J	Aksan, N; Kochanska, G				Aksan, N; Kochanska, G			Heterogeneity of joy in infancy	INFANCY												We examined 7-month-old infants' responses to 6 joy-eliciting episodes. Three episodes included and 3 did not include a major social-interactive component. Confirmatory factor analysis of infants' joy reactions in these episodes revealed that a 2-factor model significantly improved the fit over a single-factor solution. Those 2 factors represented infants' social versus nonsocial joy reactions. Different correlates of those factors supported their external validity. Only social joy was associated with the infants' positive emotional tone observed during naturalistic interactions with their mothers and fathers, and with the parents' ratings of the child's positive affect during social interactions in their daily lives. Social joy may be an early antecedent of future positive emotionality traits related to communal and interpersonal aspects of experience.

J	Hsu, HC; Porter, CL				Hsu, HC; Porter, CL			Young infants' behavioral reactivity to mild perturbation: Developmental continuity, stability, and organization	INFANCY												This study investigated the developmental continuity, stability, and organization of infants' behavioral response to mild stress from I to 3 months of age. Changes in infant stress reactivity were expected to coincide with a suspected neurobiological shift around the 2nd month. A total of 53 infants and their mothers participated in this study. At I and 3 months, infants' stress reactivity to mild perturbation was assessed by withdrawing a pacifier during nonnutritive sucking. Infant baseline heart rate activity and maternal reports of infant temperament were also obtained. Focusing on facial and vocal negativity, behavioral measures of infant reactivity to pacifier withdrawal were coded from videos. Results showed that developmental continuity and individual instability characterized changes in infant stress reactivity over the 2nd-month transition. Developmental reorganization was also evidenced by changes in the direction and magnitude of infant stress reactivity in relation to baseline heart period and maternal temperament ratings, respectively. These findings provide direct supporting evidence for the contention that changes in infant stress reactivity to mild perturbation may be a function of developmental shifts in underlying neurobiological mechanisms in early infancy.

J	Lewis, M; Hitchcock, DFA; Sullivan, MW				Lewis, M; Hitchcock, DFA; Sullivan, MW			Physiological and emotional reactivity to learning and frustration	INFANCY												This study examined the behavioral (arm, facial) and autonomic (heart rate, respiratory sinus arrhythmia [RSA], and adrenocortical axis) reactivity of 56 4-month-old infants in response to contingency learning and extinction-induced frustration. During learning, infants displayed increases in operant arm response and positive emotional expressions. Changes in average RSA(V-NA) paralleled the observed changes in facial expressions in general and maintained an inverse relation with heart rate throughout most of the session. When frustrated by extinction, infants displayed increases in negative expressions, heart rate, and a brief increase in RSA(V-NA) followed by a significant decrease. No significant changes were observed for cortisol. These behavioral and facial responses are consistent with earlier work. The physiological changes, along with the facial expressions and instrumental responses, indicate that the autonomic nervous system functions as a coordinated affect system by 4 months of age.

They were first seen at 6 months and then every 2nd month until the end of their 1 st year. Infants were presented with occlusion events covering 20% of the target's trajectory (effective occlusion interval ranged from 500-4,000 msec). Gaze was measured using an ASL 504 infrared eye-tracking system. Results effectively demonstrate that infants from 6 months of age can represent the spatiotemporal dynamics of occluded objects. Infants at all ages tested were able to predict, under certain conditions, when and where the object would reappear after occlusion. They moved gaze accurately to the position where the object was going to reappear and scaled their timing to the current occlusion duration. The average rate of predictive gaze crossings increased with occlusion duration. These results are discussed as a 2-factor process. Successful predictions are dependent on strong representations, themselves dependent on the richness of information available during encoding and graded representations.

J	Johnson, SP; Slemmer, JA; Amso, D				Johnson, SP; Slemmer, JA; Amso, D			Where infants look determines how they see: Eye movements and object perception performance in 3-month-olds	INFANCY												A fundamental question of perceptual development concerns how infants come to perceive partly hidden objects as unified across a spatial gap imposed by an occluder. Much is known about the time course of development of perceptual completion during the first several months after birth, as well as some of the visual information that supports unity perception in infants. The goal of this investigation was to examine the inputs to this process. We recorded eye movements in 3-month-old infants as they participated in a standard object unity task and found systematic differences in scanning patterns between those infants whose post-habituation preferences were indicative of unity perception versus those infants who did not perceive unity. Perceivers, relative to nonperceivers, scanned more reliably in the vicinity of the visible rod parts and scanned more frequently across the range of rod motion. These results suggest that emerging object concepts are tied closely to available visual information in the environment, and the process of information pickup.

J	McMurray, B; Aslin, RN				McMurray, B; Aslin, RN			Anticipatory eye movements reveal infants' auditory and visual categories	INFANCY												We introduce a new paradigm for the assessment of auditory and visual categories in 6-month-old infants using a 2-alternative anticipatory eye-movement response. Infants were trained by 2 different methods to anticipate the location of a visual reinforcer at I of 2 spatial locations (right or left) based on the identity of 2 cuing stimuli. After a training phase, infants were presented with a series of generalization trials in which novel (untrained) stimuli served as the cue to the anticipatory eye movement. Four experiments illustrated that infants can learn the 2-choice discriminative response during training. Infants also showed anticipatory eye movements to novel stimuli, indicating sensitivity to variations along a variety of stimulus dimensions (e.g., color, shape, orientation, spatial frequency, pitch, and duration). In addition, the paradigm can be used to assess categorization in individual infants, thereby revealing the stimulus dimensions to which infants naturally attend.																			1525-0008						2004	6	2					203	229		10.1207/s15327078in0602_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0602_4								33430530					WOS:000225055000004

Eye movements were recorded using a corneal-reflection system while the infants looked at 2 dynamic stimuli: the naturally moving face of their mother and an abstract stimulus. Results indicated that the way infants scanned these stimuli stabilized only after 18 weeks, which is slightly later than the ages reported in the literature on infants' scanning of static stimuli. This effect was especially prominent for the abstract stimulus. From the 14-week session on, infants adapted their scanning behavior to the stimulus characteristics. When scanning the video of their mother's face, infants directed their gaze at the mouth and eye region most often. Even at the youngest age, there was no indication of an edge effect.

Results of Experiment 1 confirmed previous findings, showing that when I single photograph of a face is presented in the habituation phase and when infants are required to recognize the same photograph, no differences in recognition performance with upright and inverted faces are found. However, Experiment 2 showed that, when infants are habituated to a face shown in a variety of poses and are required to recognize a new pose of the same face, infants' recognition performances were higher for upright than for inverted faces. Overall, results indicate that, under some experimental conditions, 4-month-olds process faces differently according to whether faces are presented upright or inverted.						turati, chiara/0000-0001-7496-1830													1525-0008	1532-7078					2004	6	2					275	297		10.1207/s15327078in0602_8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0602_8								33430531					WOS:000225055000008

Four contextual factors were explored: the host's responsibility for the guest's distress, similarity between the toddler and the distressed peer, relative familiarity of the peer, and the toddler's experience with peers and siblings. Hosts responded more positively to distress they had caused than to distress they witnessed. Negative reactions were most likely to be shown when hosts themselves had caused the distress of a guest of the same sex. Hosts were less likely to respond either positively or negatively if they had known their guests all their lives. Toddlers who had older siblings were more likely than other hosts to respond negatively to guests' distress.

Maternal anxiety and depression were assessed by standardized measures during the third trimester of pregnancy and postpartum. Infant negative behavioral responses to novelty were assessed using a previously validated measure at 4 months of age.

J	Schweinle, A; Wilcox, T				Schweinle, A; Wilcox, T			Sex differences in infants' ability to represent complex event sequences	INFANCY												Prior research suggests that when very simple event sequences are used, 4.5-month-olds demonstrate the ability to individuate objects based on the continuity or disruption of their speed of motion (Wilcox & Schweinle, 2003). However, infants demonstrate their ability to individuate objects in an event-monitoring task (i.e., infants must keep track of an ongoing event) at a younger age than in an event-mapping task (i.e., infants must compare information from 2 different events). The research presented here built on these findings by examining infants' capacity to succeed on an event-mapping task with a more complex event sequence to determine if the complexity of the event interferes with their ability to form summary representations of the event, and, in short, individuate the objects. Three experiments were conducted with infants 4.5 to 9.5 months of age. The results indicated that (a) increasing the complexity of the objects' trajectories adversely affected infants' performance on the task, and (b) boys were more likely to succeed than girls. These findings shed light on how representational capacities change during the first year of life and are discussed in terms of information processing and representational capabilities as well as neuro-anatomical development.					; Schweinle, Amy/L-3843-2014	Wilcox, Teresa/0000-0002-8390-5125; Schweinle, Amy/0000-0002-5813-2423													1525-0008	1532-7078					2004	6	3					333	359		10.1207/s15327078in0603_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0603_2													WOS:000226060400002

Surface attributes influence infants' sensitivity to goal-directed action	INFANCY												Three studies investigated the role of surface attributes in infants' identification of agents, using a habituation paradigm designed to tap infants' interpretation of grasping as goal directed (Woodward, 1998). When they viewed a bare human hand grasping objects, 7- and 12-month-old infants focused on the relation between the hand and its goal. When the surface properties of the hand were obscured by a glove, however, neither 7- nor 12-month-old infants represented its actions as goal directed (Study 1). Next, infants were shown that the gloved hands were part of a person either prior to (Study 2) or during (Study 3) the habituation procedure. Infants who actively monitored the gloved person in Study 2 and older infants in Study 3 interpreted the gloved reaches as goal directed. Thus, varying the extent to which an entity is identifiable as a person impacts infants' interpretation of the entity as an agent.

During habituation, infants heard 1 novel word (e.g., teek) while viewing dynamic containment events (i.e., Big Bird placed in a box) and, on other habituation trials, a second novel word (e.g., blick) while viewing dynamic support events (i.e., Big Bird placed on the box). Each novel word was presented in a sentence (e.g., "She's putting Big Bird teek the box"). During the test, infants discriminated an event that maintained the habituation word-relation pairing from one that presented a switch in this pairing. The results indicate that 14-month-olds can learn to form word-relation associations quickly, requiring only a few minutes of experience with each word-relation pairing.

We examined developmental changes in the timing of smiles during episodes of initiating joint attention that involved an infant gazing between an object and a social partner. Twenty-six typically developing infants were observed at 8, 10, and 12 months during the Early Social-Communication Scales, a semistructured assessment for eliciting initiating joint attention and related behaviors. The proportion of infant smiling during initiating joint attention episodes did not change with age, but there was a change in the timing of the smiles. The likelihood of infants smiling at an object and then gazing at the experimenter while smiling (anticipatory smiling) increased between 8 and 10 months and remained stable between 10 and 12 months. The increase in the number of infants who smiled at an object and then made eye contact suggests a developing ability to communicate positive affect about an object.						, Meaghan/0000-0002-6878-0133													1525-0008	1532-7078					2004	6	3					397	406		10.1207/s15327078in0603_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0603_5								16467930					WOS:000226060400005

Twenty-month-olds who had participated in a still-face procedure at 5 months (experience group) fixated the face of the person who had instigated the still face significantly less than the faces of 2 other novel persons. Control 20-month-olds (no-experience group) looked longer overall and fixated the target person equally or more than the 2 novel persons. In short, children who interacted with a stranger in the laboratory under both natural and anomalous social conditions just once when they were infants apparently retained a specific memory of that person and the experience into toddlerhood.																			1525-0008						2004	6	3					407	416		10.1207/s15327078in0603_6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0603_6													WOS:000226060400006
J	Izard, CE				Izard, CE			The generality-specificity issue in infants' emotion responses: A comment on Bennett, Bendersky, and Lewis (2002)	INFANCY												Bennett, Bendersky, and Lewis (2002) highlighted a need for revision, or at least clarification, of aspects of differential emotions theory (DET) that relate to the development of facial expressions of discrete emotions. Their article reveals a need for a better theoretical integration of propositions about the emergence of discrete emotions, the generality and flexibility of emotion responding, and issue of specificity in event-emotion relations. Bennett et al. tested and partly disconfirmed a hard version of an event-emotion hypothesis that predicts a specific discrete emotion expression for a specific stimulus at a particular age (4 months). They noted that some statements of DET supported their hypothesis, whereas others did not. 1 clarify the relevant theoretical issues and formulate a soft hypothesis of event-emotion relations. I suggest methodological changes that may prove necessary to verify or disconfirm hypotheses relating to infants' capacity to encode a specific discrete emotion expression at a given age.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2004	6	3					417	423		10.1207/s15327078in0603_7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0603_7													WOS:000226060400007
J	Bennett, DS; Bendersky, M; Lewis, M				Bennett, DS; Bendersky, M; Lewis, M			On specifying specificity: Facial expressions at 4 months	INFANCY												Izard (2004/this issue) clarifies the position of differential emotions theory by proposing a distinction between hard and soft versions of event-emotion expression relations. We concur that the best design to examine situational specificity in facial expressions is one that utilizes multiple stimulus situations assessed over multiple occasions and ages. However, the problem of how to identify, a priori, a family of stimulus situations remains. We offer an example from our own recent work demonstrating how facial expressions and physiological indexes may converge to indicate the presence of a meaningful family of stimulus situations. Specifically, we found evidence for a family of frustrating, goal-blocking events that elicited expressions and cortisol responses indicative of anger at 4 months. Yet, individual differences exist in that these situations also elicited expressions and cortisol changes indicative of sadness. Identification of a more comprehensive set of such situations throughout infancy will allow researchers to more systematically examine the degree to which situational specificity of emotions is present.

Infants were then administered the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (BSID) and MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory (MCDI) at 12, 18, and 24 months. Prior findings regarding the decline in look duration with age were replicated. Age-based factors were extracted from the monthly assessments, an early attention factor from 3 to 6 months and a late attention factor from 7 to 9 months. A novelty preference factor, which grouped recognition performance at 4 and 6 months of age, was also derived. The late attention factor correlated negatively with a factor score derived from the BSID mental index, and the novelty preference aggregate was correlated positively with a factor score derived from the MCDI production scores. Two clusters of infants were derived based on the developmental course of change from the early attention to late attention look duration aggregates: One cluster (n = 150) decreased strongly, and another (n = 50) increased. Infants belonging to these clusters subsequently differed on both the BSID and MCDI outcomes, with the former cluster showing distinct advantages that increased as the outcome assessments progressed from 12 to 24 months of age. This finding was bolstered by subsequent analyses of data from infants who completed all tests run from 3 to 9 months. The results of this study suggest that the developmental Course of attention during infancy is an important clue to cognitive and language outcomes in early childhood.

Whether this ability operates from birth is unknown. Three experiments were carried out with 2- to 5-day-old newborns. The first experiment replicated the previous finding that newborns are able to discriminate between direct and averted gaze, and extended this finding from real to schematic faces. In Experiments 2 and 3 newborns were faster to make saccades to peripheral targets cued by the direction of eye movement of a central schematic face, but only when the motion of the pupils was visible.

Infants' positive and negative affect and parents' positive affect and physical play were coded from videotapes. Consistent with previous research, during the normal condition, mothers displayed more positive affect than did fathers, and fathers were more likely than mothers to display physical play. Infants were more positive with mothers than with fathers. Parents' positive affect but not parent gender predicted infants' positive affect at 6 months. During the still-face condition, infants of parents with a lifetime history of depression were more likely to display negative affect and less likely to display positive affect than infants with no such parent history. Infants' affect was unrelated to parents' current level of depressive symptoms, which indicates the value of considering family history of psychopathology when examining individual differences in infants' affect.					; Forbes, Erika/J-2445-2015	Allen, Nicholas/0000-0002-1086-6639; Forbes, Erika/0000-0003-0659-7744													1525-0008	1532-7078					2004	5	1					61	84		10.1207/s15327078in0501_3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0501_3								16915346					WOS:000221386600003

One hundred and eight LBW infants and their mothers were videotaped during a typical feeding when the infant was 3 months old. This tape was used to analyze both the mother's touch and other facets of caregiving behavior using standardized coding systems. Data on perinatal medical risk were also acquired through chart review, and neurodevelopmental tests were administered to the infants at age I year. Results indicate that infants whose mothers used more stimulating touch during caregiving had better visual-motor skills at 1 year of age. In addition, infants of mothers who touched them frequently had more advanced gross motor development. Findings suggest that stimulating and frequent touch may help to compensate for early neurosensory deficits and promote neurodevelopment for LBW infants. Infant birth weight made the strongest contribution to all measures of infant neurodevelopmental status at age 1 year.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2004	5	1					85	107		10.1207/s15327078in0501_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0501_4													WOS:000221386600004

This research extends beyond prior research in that children were shown dynamic events with novel entities, and were asked not only to comprehend sentences but to use sentence structure to infer the meaning of a new word. In a 4 x 3 design, animacy status (e.g., animate agent, inanimate patient) and labeling syntax (agent, patient, nonlabel control) were varied. Across most events, 2(1)/(2)-year-old participants responded as if they expected animate entities to be named. However, in a prototypical (animate agent-inanimate patient) event condition, children responded differentially across different syntactic structures. Thus, the clearest evidence for attention to syntactic cues was found in the prototypical event condition. These results suggest that young children attend to the animacy status of unfamiliar entities, that they have expectations about animacy relations in events, and that these expectations support emerging syntactic knowledge.

J	Westermann, G; Mareschal, D				Westermann, G; Mareschal, D			From parts to wholes: Mechanisms of development in infant visual object processing	INFANCY												Visual object processing in infancy is often described as proceeding from an early stage in which object features are processed independently to a later stage in which relations between features are taken into account (e.g., Cohen, 1998). Here we present the Representational Acuity Hypothesis, which argues that this behavioral shift can be explained by a developmental decrease in the size of neural receptive fields in the cortical areas responsible for object representation, together with a tuning to specific object features. We evaluate this hypothesis with a connectionist model of infant perceptual categorization. The model shows a behavioral shift in featural to relational processing consistent with similar results observed in the infant categorization experiments of Younger (1985) and Younger and Cohen (1986).

J	Shultz, TR; Cohen, LB				Shultz, TR; Cohen, LB			Modeling age differences in infant category learning	INFANCY												We used an encoder version of cascade correlation to simulate Younger and Cohen's (1983, 1986) finding that 10-month-olds recover attention on the basis of correlations among stimulus features, but 4- and 7-month-olds recover attention on the basis of stimulus features. We captured these effects by varying the score threshold parameter in cascade correlation, which controls how deeply training patterns are learned. When networks learned deeply, they showed more error to uncorrelated than to correlated test patterns, indicating that they abstracted correlations during familiarization. When prevented from learning deeply, networks decreased error during familiarization and showed as much error to correlated as to uncorrelated tests but less than to test items with novel features, indicating that they learned features but not correlations among features. Our explanation is that older infants learn more from the same exposure than do younger infants. Unlike previous explanations that postulate unspecified qualitative shifts in processing with age, our explanation focuses on quantitatively deeper learning with increasing age. Finally, we provide some new empirical evidence to support this explanation.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2004	5	2					153	171		10.1207/s15327078in0502_3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0502_3								33401792					WOS:000221579400003

In this article, we apply a successful connectionist model of adult category learning to developmental data. The Supervised and Unsupervised Stratified Adaptive Incremental Network (SUSTAIN) model is able to account for the emergence of infants' sensitivity to correlated attributes (e.g., has wings and can fly). SUSTAIN offers 2 complimentary explanations of the developmental trend. One explanation centers on memory storage limitations, whereas the other focuses on limitations in perceptual systems. Both explanations parallel published findings concerning the cognitive and sensory limitations of infants. SUSTAIN's simulations suggest that conceptual development follows a continuous and smooth trajectory despite qualitative changes in behavior and that the mechanisms that underlie infant and adult categorization might not differ significantly.

In this article, the way in which the models are able to simulate the behavioral data is revealed, and their respective theoretical commitments are evaluated. Together the models argue that the shift from featural to correlational processing in infant categorization might be illusory, as these models are able to replicate the key behavioral features while processing correlations right from the start. As such, they claim the behavioral description of a shift is not reflected at the level of mechanism.

In 2 locomotor A-not-B tasks, 13-month-old walking infants inhibited a prepotent response under low task demands (walking on flat ground), but perseverated under increased task demands (descending a staircase). Despite elimination of factors previously associated with infant perseveration, infants still perseverated in the difficult stairs condition. Increasing cognitive load by manipulating task difficulty affected infants' ability to inhibit repeated responses that were no longer appropriate. Evidence supports a cognitive capacity account of infant perseveration, in which infants' performance depends on allocation of cognitive and attentional resources.

We assessed infants' distraction latencies longitudinally at 6.5 and 9 months as they explored toys, and we coded both their attentional state (focused vs. casual) and how long they had been looking at the toy at each distractor onset. Consistent with previous results, both attentional state and attentional inertia contributed to differences in distraction latency. Importantly, the level of attentional engagement was interactively determined by attentional state and attentional inertia. Infants were most resistant to distraction when they were judged to be in a state of focused attention following relatively long looks to the toy, and they were equivalently less resistant to distraction under all other conditions. These results are consistent with a general conceptualization of attentional engagement resulting from the interaction of multiple processes.

This study examined whether the facilitative effect of intersensory redundancy also extends to the domain of memory. We assessed bobwhite quail chicks' ability to remember and prefer an individual maternal call presented either unimodally or redundantly and synchronously with patterned light during the period prior to hatching. Embryos provided with unimodal auditory exposure failed to prefer the familiar call over a novel maternal call postnatally at 48 hr and 72 hr following exposure. In contrast, embryos provided with redundant, synchronous audiovisual stimulation significantly preferred the familiar call at 48 hr following exposure, but not at 72 hr. A second experiment provided chicks with a single 10-min refamiliarization with the familiar call at either 48 hr or 72 hr following hatching. Chicks given only unimodal auditory exposure prior to hatching did not appear to benefit from this brief postnatal refamiliarization, showing no preference for the familiar call at either 72 or 96 hr. Chicks that received redundant audiovisual stimulation prenatally showed a significant preference for the familiar call (following the brief reexposure 24 hr earlier) at both 72 and 96 hr of age. These results are the first to demonstrate that redundantly specified information is remembered longer and reactivated more easily than the same information presented unimodally. These findings provide further evidence of the salience of intersensory redundancy in guiding selective attention and perceptual learning during early development.

J	Lipton, JS; Spelke, ES				Lipton, JS; Spelke, ES			Discrimination of large and small numerosities by human infants	INFANCY												Six experiments investigated infants' sensitivity to numerosity in auditory sequences. In prior studies (Lipton & Spelke, 2003), 6-month-old infants discriminated sequences of 8 versus 16 but not 8 versus 12 sounds, and 9-month-old infants discriminated 8 versus 12 but not 8 versus 10 sounds, when the continuous variables of rate, sound duration, and sequence duration were controlled. The current studies investigated whether infants' numerical discrimination is subject to the signature ratio limit of adults' numerosity discrimination. Four experiments at 6 and 9 months provided evidence for this signature limit, suggesting that common mechanisms underlie numerosity discrimination in infants and adults. In further experiments, infants failed to discriminate 2 versus 4 or 2 versus 3 sounds when tested under the same conditions as with large numbers. These findings accord with studies using visual-spatial arrays (e.g., Clearfield & Mix, 1999) and suggest that separate systems underlie infants' representation of small and large numerosities.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2004	5	3					271	290		10.1207/s15327078in0503_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0503_2													WOS:000223050000002

This study tested the following predictions: First, in typically developing children declarative pointing emerges later than imperative pointing. Second, the capacity to use declarative pointing is linked to the understanding of other's intentions (i.e., to the capacity to reproduce other's intended acts after seeing failed attempts to perform these acts). The study was conducted in 2 phases. In the first phase, the parents of 133 typically developing infants completed the Questionnaire on Pointing Gesture, which allowed the identification of babies able to use pointing in familiar contexts. Of these children, 40 participated in the experiment and were tested on 2 tasks: a new task designed to elicit production and comprehension of imperative and declarative pointing, and a modified version of Meltzoff's (1995) task designed to assess understanding of others' intentions. Tasks were administered to each participant in 2 sessions carried out at 3-month intervals. Children were 12 months old on average at the 1st session and 15 months old on average at the 2nd session. Results showed that children produced and understood declarative pointing later than imperative pointing. Furthermore, production of declarative pointing was clearly linked to understanding of others' intentions. No relation was found between production and comprehension of imperative pointing and intention understanding. Implications from the association between declarative pointing and inferring other's intentions are discussed.

J	Fisher-Thompson, D; Peterson, JA				Fisher-Thompson, D; Peterson, JA			Infant side biases and familiarity-novelty preferences during a serial paired-comparison task	INFANCY												We monitored changes in looking that emerged when 3- to 6-month-old infants were presented with 48 trials pairing familiar and novel faces. Graphic displays were used to identify changes in looking throughout the task. Many infants exhibited strong side biases produced by infants looking repeatedly in the same direction. Although an overall novelty preference was found for the group, individual infants exhibited brief novelty runs. Few infants began with a familiarity preference. We argue that variable looking patterns emerged during the task from competition between the infants' preference to look for something novel versus their tendency to look back to previous locations. Our data suggest that looking during paired-comparison tasks is a dynamic process dependent on perceptual-motor events happening during the task itself.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2004	5	3					309	340		10.1207/s15327078in0503_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327078in0503_4													WOS:000223050000004

In this article we present the results of 2 experiments that investigated whether German children between 12 and 16 months of age can use distributional knowledge that determiners precede nouns and subject pronouns precede verbs to syntactically categorize adjacent novel words. Evidence from the head-turn preference paradigm shows that, although 12- to 13-month-olds cannot do this, 14- to 16-month-olds are able to use a determiner to categorize a following novel word as a noun. In contrast, no categorization effect was found for a novel word following a subject pronoun. To understand this difference we analyzed adult child-directed speech. This analysis showed that there are in fact stronger co-occurrence relations between determiners and nouns than between subject pronouns and verbs. Thus, in German determiners may be more reliable Cues to the syntactic category of an adjacent novel word than are subject pronouns. We propose that the capacity to syntactically categorize novel words, demonstrated here for the first time in children this young, mediates between the recognition of the specific morphosyntactic frame in which a novel word appears and the word-to-world mapping that is needed to build up a semantic representation for the novel word.

J	Shaddy, DJ; Colombo, J				Shaddy, DJ; Colombo, J			Developmental changes in infant attention to dynamic and static stimuli	INFANCY												This study examined 4- and 6-month-olds' responses to static or dynamic stimuli using behavioral and heart-rate-defined measures of attention. Infants looked longest to dynamic stimuli with an audio track and least to a static stimulus that was mute. Overall, look duration declined with age to the different stimuli. The amount of time spent in sustained attention at 4 months, but not at 6 months, was related to stimulus discrimination. These results indicate that the decline in look duration typically observed during the middle of the 1st year for static stimuli does generalize to dynamic stimuli. The results further suggest that the amount of time spent in sustained attention during habituation may be an important indicator of processing in younger infants.

Fourteen preterm (28-31 weeks gestation) and 11 full-term infants completed at least 3 conditioning sessions, I week apart, at 5 months of age (corrected age). Preterm and full-term groups demonstrated associative learning, as confirmed by comparison with an unpaired control group. Preterm infants, however, exhibited more variability in their learning rates. The majority of full-term infants and half the preterm infants exhibited rapid acquisition and gradual extinction of conditional responding. A greater proportion of preterm than full-term infants failed to acquire conditional responding within 2 training sessions. Differences in associative learning rates were not the result of differences in arousal or attentional processes. Diversity in acquisition rates exposed an increased risk for disrupted infant learning due to premature birth.

J	Hunter, SK; Richards, JE				Hunter, SK; Richards, JE			Peripheral stimulus localization by 5-to 14-week-old infants during phases of attention	INFANCY												This study examined the effect of attention in young infants on the saccadic localization of peripheral stimuli. Infants ranging in age from 5 to 14 weeks were tested using a peripheral stimulus detection paradigm. The presence of a central fixation stimulus decreased detection probability, particularly if attention was engaged with the central stimulus. Peripheral stimulus localization usually was accomplished with a single eye movement. When localization was accomplished by multiple eye movements, corrective saccades occurred most frequently and fixed-amplitude hypometric saccades occurred less frequently. A decrease in the slope of the linear component of the main sequence was found from 5 to 11 weeks of age, and this decrease was independent of attention.

J	Henderson, EN; Jennings, KD				Henderson, EN; Jennings, KD			Maternal depression and the ability to facilitate joint attention with 18-month-olds	INFANCY												Maternal depression has been associated with the mother-child dyad's ability to engage in joint attention. This study of 69 depressed and 63 control mothers and their 18-month-olds addresses how aspects of maternal psychopathology are related to joint attention during a snack interaction. Although nondepressed-mother dyads appeared better at joint attention than depressed-mother dyads, this difference was not statistically significant. Among the depressed-mother dyads, joint attention was related to presence of a comorbid Axis I diagnosis (usually an anxiety disorder) versus a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) only. Surprisingly, dyads with mothers who met criteria for a comorbid diagnosis were better at joint attention than those with MDD only, despite the fact that those mothers were likely to have longer and more severe depressive histories. The relationship between comorbid status and joint attention was mediated by the mother's affect. Rationale for the paradoxical finding that the "more pathological" mothers had greater success in engaging in joint attention is discussed.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2003	4	1					27	46		10.1207/S15327078IN0401_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0401_2													WOS:000186372000002

Both groups of infants habituated the temperature of the tube, as indicated by a decrease in holding, and dishabituated, as indexed by an increase in holding when the temperature of the tube changed.

J	Schuetze, P; Zeskind, PS; Das Eiden, R				Schuetze, P; Zeskind, PS; Das Eiden, R			The perceptions of infant distress signals varying in pitch by cocaine-using mothers	INFANCY												Perceptual responses to infant distress signals were studied in 16 cocaine-using and 15 comparison mothers. All mothers rated tape recordings of 48 replications of a newborn infant's hunger cry digitally altered to increase in fundamental frequency in 100-Hz increments. Cries were rated on 4 perceptual (arousing, aversive, urgent, and sick) and 6 caregiving rating scale items (clean, cuddle, feed, give pacifier, pick up, and wait and see) used in previous studies. Analyses of variance showed that, as cry pitch increased, cries were rated as more arousing, aversive, and urgent sounding. The highest pitched cries received the highest ratings for caregiving interventions. Main effects for cocaine use showed cocaine-using mothers (a) rated cries as less arousing, aversive, urgent, and sick; (b) indicated they were less likely to pick up or feed the infant; and (c) indicated they more likely to give the crying infant a pacifier or just "wait and see." A Group x Cry Pitch interaction effect showed that mothers in the cocaine group gave higher ratings to wait and see as the pitch of the cries increased, whereas mothers in the comparison group gave lower ratings to wait and see as the pitch of the cries increased. These ratings indicate that cocaine-using mothers found cries to be less perceptually salient and less likely to elicit nurturant caregiving responses. These results suggest that maternal cocaine use is associated with altered perceptions of infant distress signals that may provide the basis for differential social responsivity in the caregiving context.					; Schuetze, Pamela/AGL-7968-2022	Eiden, Rina/0000-0002-5303-3661; Schuetze, Pamela/0000-0001-9348-5788													1525-0008	1532-7078					2003	4	1					65	83		10.1207/S15327078IN0401_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0401_4													WOS:000186372000004

Audio recordings of mothers (6 with female, and 6 with male infants) talking to another adult and to their infant at 5 ages were low-pass filtered and rated by 60 adults on 5 scales (Positive or Negative Affect, Express Affection, Encourage Attention, Comfort or Soothe, and Direct Behavior). Mean fundamental frequency (F-0) and pitch range of utterances were also measured. Utterances associated with positive affect tend to peak at 6 and 12 months, whereas more directive utterances peaked at 9 months. Mean F-0 followed the age trend for affective utterances, and pitch range followed the trend for directive utterances. The results suggest mother speech patterns reflect, complement, and perhaps facilitate infant development.

Three orders were presented: (a) contingent, noncontingent, contingent; (b) contingent, contingent, noncontingent; and (c) noncontingent, contingent, contingent. Contingency and carryover effects were shown to both mothers and strangers in the different orders of presentation. Infants were more visually attentive to contingent interactions than to the noncontingent replay when contingent interactions occurred prior to the replay, and the infants' level of attention to the noncontingent replay carried over to subsequent contingent interactions. The 4- and 6-month-old infants showed contingency and carryover effects by their visual attention and smiling. Examination of effect sizes for attention suggests 2-month-old infants may be beginning to show the effects. Reasons for age changes in sensitivity to social contingency are discussed.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2003	4	1					111	140		10.1207/S15327078IN0401_6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0401_6													WOS:000186372000006
J	Pierroutsakos, SL; DeLoache, JS				Pierroutsakos, SL; DeLoache, JS			Infants' manual exploration of pictorial objects varying in realism	INFANCY												In previous research, we established that 9-month-old infants manually investigate pictured objects by hitting, rubbing, and grasping as if to pluck them off the page. This behavior suggests that infants do not understand the 2-dimensional nature of pictures. Although they can perceive depth cues and distinguish pictures from objects, they do not appreciate the significance of these cues; that is, they do not realize how depicted objects differ from real ones. We report 2 studies that support the idea that infants' manual response to pictures is driven by the resemblance of depicted objects to the real objects they represent. In Study 1, we report that infants' manual investigation of pictures is directly related to how realistic they are: The more depicted objects look like real objects, the more manual investigation they evoke. In Study 2, we show that 9-month-old infants' manual behaviors are concentrated on depicted objects even when there are areas of greater perceptual contrast on the page. The results are discussed with respect to the early development of pictorial competence.																			1525-0008						2003	4	1					141	156		10.1207/S15327078IN0401_7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0401_7													WOS:000186372000007

Such results suggest that infants and older animals differ in how they learn simultaneous events. This study tested whether the infant's special effectiveness with such learning is peculiar to P8-16 or is a general feature of infantile naivete seen in newborns as well. At 3 hr of age newborn rats exhibited strikingly robust sensory preconditioning and second-order conditioning, but only for simultaneous odors. Any degree of temporal disparity between odors (even 0 see) eliminated sensory preconditioning and markedly reduced second-order conditioning. This suggests that the weak differentiation among simultaneously presented stimuli in newborns may promote something similar to perceptual configuration.																			1525-0008						2003	4	2					157	176		10.1207/S15327078IN0402_01	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0402_01													WOS:000186372100001

Despite its importance for spatial perception and for guiding locomotion, very little is known about how the ability to perceive one's direction of motion, or heading, from optic flow develops early in life. In this article, we report the results of 3 experiments that tested the abilities of 4-month-old infants to discriminate optic flow patterns simulating different directions of self-motion. The combined results from 2 different experimental paradigms suggest that 4-month-olds discriminate optic flow patterns that simulate only large (> 32degrees) changes in the direction of the observer's motion through space. This suggests that prior to the onset of locomotion, there are limitations on infants' abilities to process patterns of optic flow related to self-motion.

Dyads were observed in 2 contexts (1 involved sharing pictures and the other sharing musical toys) when infants were 18 and 24 months of age. Vocal rhythmic behavior was seen in both contexts, and in both contexts mothers matched their infant's vocal rhythmic behavior at greater than chance rates. Greater matching tended to be associated with higher language scores whereas, counter to prediction, higher rates of maternal vocal rhythmic behavior tended to be associated with lower language scores. At 24 months of age, mother-daughter dyads showed more matching than mother-son dyads. These results suggest that differences in maternal production of vocal rhythmic behavior may foster different language learning strategies.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2003	4	2					201	217		10.1207/S15327078IN0402_03	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0402_03													WOS:000186372100003

Nineteen infants (6 at 6 months, 7 at 9 months, and 6 at 12 months) and their parents participated. A randomization procedure controlled for the frequencies and durations of the communicative acts identified by the parents, and the procedure produced a distribution of 10,000 "chance" agreement values for each parent pair with which their observed level of agreement was compared. The results indicated that, generally, parents could identify their infant's communicative acts consistently, and that observed levels of agreement between parents were significantly higher than would be expected by chance. Differences between mothers and fathers on their identification of communicative acts are considered in terms of the emergence of the infant's intention to communicate.																			1525-0008						2003	4	2					219	234		10.1207/S15327078IN0402_04	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0402_04													WOS:000186372100004

Mothers were observed during free play with their infants to assess their attention-directing strategies. Infants were observed during the Bayley to assess their focused attention abilities. Assessments were made when infants were 10 and 18 months. Whereas consistently high levels of maintaining over time were modestly associated with better infant focused attention at 18 months, consistently high levels of redirecting were moderately associated with poorer infant focused attention at 18 months. Additionally, more focused attention was associated with higher Bayley scores at both ages. Although the direction of effects could not be determined, the findings suggest links between maternal attention-directing strategies (maintaining and redirecting) during play and infant attentional abilities during problem solving.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2003	4	2					235	250		10.1207/S15327078IN0402_05	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0402_05													WOS:000186372100005

The testing procedure was the same for both types of words: Children were familiarized with instances of isolated nouns, and then tested on their recognition of these nouns embedded in passages. In English, typically developing infants start segmenting strong-weak nouns by 7.5 months of age, and weak-strong nouns by 10.5 months. Our clinical population was able to segment strong-weak nouns, but failed, despite chronological ages above 15 months, to segment weak-strong words. These results suggest that the development of word segmentation is seriously delayed in Williams syndrome. This deficit in early phonological processing may contribute to a fuller understanding of the late lexical onset in this population, a phenomenon that had hitherto only been explained in terms of cognitive and semantic deficits.

J	Saffran, JR; Wilson, DP				Saffran, JR; Wilson, DP			From syllables to syntax: Multilevel statistical learning by 12-month-old infants	INFANCY												To successfully acquire language, infants must be able to track multiple levels of regularities in the input. In many cases, regularities only emerge after some learning has already occurred. For example, the grammatical relationships between words are only evident once the words have been segmented from continuous speech. To ask whether infants can engage in this type of learning process, 12-month-old infants in 2 experiments were familiarized with multiword utterances synthesized as continuous speech. The words in the utterances were ordered based on a simple finite-state grammar. Following exposure, infants were tested on novel grammatical and ungrammatical sentences. The results indicate that the infants were able to perform 2 statistical learning tasks in sequence: first segmenting the words from continuous speech, and subsequently discovering the permissible orderings of the words. Given a single set of input, infants were able to acquire multiple levels of structure, suggesting that multiple levels of representation (initially syllable-level combinations, subsequently word-level combinations) can emerge during the course of learning.																			1525-0008						2003	4	2					273	284		10.1207/S15327078IN0402_07	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0402_07													WOS:000186372100007

Little is known, however, about how infants' motion processing skills are used in such tasks. One important kinetic cue for object shape is structure from motion, but its role in unity perception remains unknown. To address this issue, we presented 2- and 4-month-old infants with displays in which object unity was specified by vertical rotation. After habituation to this display, infants viewed broken and complete versions of the object to test their preference for the broken object, an indication of perception of unity in the occlusion display. Positive evidence for the perception of unity was provided by both age groups. Concomitant edge translation available in I condition did not appear to contribute above and beyond simple rotation. These results suggest that structure from motion, and perhaps contour deformation and shading cues, can contribute important information for veridical object percepts in very young infants.

It was hypothesized that infants exposed to greater levels of marital conflict would demonstrate lower levels of emotional and physiological regulation. Fifty-six low-risk infants and their mothers attended a laboratory session when infants were 6 months of age. A baseline EKG was gathered to assess infants' cardiac vagal tone and the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and Behavior Rating Scales were administered. Mothers also completed Braiker and Kelley's (1979) marital quality questionnaire. Consistent with past research with preschoolers, marital conflict was found to be linked to lower levels of emotion regulation in infants. However, unlike past research (Gottman & Katz, 1989), results indicated that marital conflict was associated with lower levels of cardiac vagal tone in infants as opposed to higher levels of vagal tone among preschoolers. These findings are explained in terms of a possible developmental alteration in the link between marital conflict and vagal tone from early infancy to later childhood. Findings also have important implications for understanding the potential impact of the early marital relational context for infants emerging regulatory abilities.

Three experiments were carried out using a visual paired-comparison task. Evidence showed that, after familiarization either to closed-shaped or to open-shaped forms, newborns manifested a novelty preference for a novel-category rather than for a familiar-category exemplar (Experiment 1). This result could not be explained either as a consequence of the newborns' inability to discriminate between instances of the same category of simple geometric forms (Experiment 2), or as a consequence of a spontaneous preference for the novel-category exemplars (Experiment 3). Overall, findings revealed that newborns are able to form broad categories of distinguishable geometric shapes by relying on the shapes' perceptual similarity.					; simion, francesca/D-6175-2015	turati, chiara/0000-0001-7496-1830; simion, francesca/0000-0002-0101-9753													1525-0008						2003	4	3					309	325		10.1207/S15327078IN0403_01	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0403_01													WOS:000186372200001
J	Younger, BA; Furrer, SD				Younger, BA; Furrer, SD			A comparison of visual familiarization and object-examining measures of categorization in 9-month-old infants	INFANCY												Three studies were conducted to determine whether differential patterns of categorization observed in studies using visual familiarization and object-examining measures hold up as procedural confounds are eliminated. In Experiment 1, we attempted as direct a comparison as possible between visual and object-examining measures of categorization. Consistent with previous reports, 9-month-old infants distinguished a basic-level contrast (dog-horse) in the visual task, but not in the examining task. Experiment 2 was designed to reduce levels of nonexploratory activity in an examining task; 9-month-olds again failed to distinguish categories of dogs and horses. In Experiment 3, we adopted a paired-comparison test format in the object-examining task. Infants did display a novel category preference under paired testing conditions. The results suggest that the different patterns of categorization often seen in looking and touching tasks are a reflection, not of different categorization processes, but of the differential sensitivity of the tasks.																			1525-0008						2003	4	3					327	348		10.1207/S15327078IN0403_02	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0403_02													WOS:000186372200002
J	Fulkerson, AL; Haaf, RA				Fulkerson, AL; Haaf, RA			The influence of labels, non-labeling sounds, and source of auditory input on 9-and 15-month-olds' object categorization	INFANCY												This experiment examines the joint influence of auditory and social cues on infants' basic-level and global categorization. Nine- and fifteen-month-olds were familiarized to a series of category exemplars in an object-examining task. Objects were introduced with a labeling phrase, a non-labeling sound, or no sound, and auditory input was presented orally by the experimenter or played on a hidden voice recorder. Novel objects from the familiarized category and a contrasting category were then presented. Results of analyses performed on novelty preference scores indicated that infants demonstrated basic-level categorization in all conditions. However, infants at both age levels only demonstrated global categorization when labeling phrases were introduced. In addition, labels led to global categorization in 9-month-olds regardless of the source of those labels; however, labels only led to global categorization in 15-month-olds when the labels were presented orally by the experimenter.																			1525-0008						2003	4	3					349	369		10.1207/S15327078IN0403_03	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0403_03													WOS:000186372200003
J	Mash, C; Keen, R; Berthier, NE				Mash, C; Keen, R; Berthier, NE			Visual access and attention in two-year-olds' event reasoning and object search	INFANCY												Several recent studies have revealed substantial limitations in 2-year-olds' ability to search accurately for objects that have undergone unseen movement, even along highly constrained paths. In many of these studies, children observed a ball as it rolled down a track and behind an occluding panel that contained 4 doors. The track had a barrier that was partly visible and could be placed in locations corresponding to the doors. When the ball came to a rest against the barrier and behind the occluder, the child's task was to find the ball by opening the correct door. The search accuracy of 2-year-olds has not differed from chance across several variations of this task. This research was conducted to identify the source of 2-year-olds' limitation in this domain. Children were granted a full view of the event before the ball was occluded with a door panel. Children's performance was better under this condition, but was still not systematically accurate unless their gaze remained locked onto the correct location. Two-year-olds' weak performance in these search tasks appears to be more a consequence of limitations in spatial integration than in their representation of unseen movement.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2003	4	3					371	388		10.1207/S15327078IN0403_04	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0403_04													WOS:000186372200004
J	Adler, SA; Haith, MM				Adler, SA; Haith, MM			The nature of infants' visual expectations for event content	INFANCY												Recent studies have revealed that young infants can form expectations for the spatial location of future visual events. Four experiments examined whether 3-month-old infants also form expectations for content features of events, defined as an invariant color combination. Infants viewed a spatially alternating (left-right) sequence of varying pictures in which pictures on one side (invariant colors) always appeared with the same color combination (e.g., red/green), while on the other side (varied colors) the pictures appeared with any of 4 possible color combinations. Results indicated that infants formed a content expectation for the invariant color combination on the invariant side, such that their anticipatory responding was disrupted by a novel color combination event and by a novel pattern event. A dissociation between reactive and anticipatory eye movements in their sensitivity to the content manipulation suggests that infants' expectations for spatial and content information engage somewhat different processes.

(subject-question) and "What did the X hit?" (object-question). Infants responded appropriately to subject-questions by 15 months of age, and to both subject- and object-questions by 20 months. At no age did infants look longer toward the object overtly mentioned in the question, as might be expected based on a surface account of early language acquisition. This suggests that infants may have some understanding of these complex structures long before they are produced.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2003	4	3					423	436		10.1207/S15327078IN0403_06	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0403_06													WOS:000186372200006

J	Adamson, LB; Frick, JE				Adamson, LB; Frick, JE			The still face: A history of a shared experimental paradigm	INFANCY					International Conference on Infant Studies	APR, 2002	TORONTO, CANADA					When faced by a suddenly unresponsive social partner, young infants typically react by sobering and gazing away. This still-face reaction has intrigued researchers for several decades. In this article, we present a history of the still-face paradigm in which we locate early observations of the still-face effect, describe the formalization of a procedure that reliably produces it, and discuss how this procedure has been used to investigate a broad range of questions about early social and emotional development. In addition, we reflect on the heuristic value of shared experimental paradigms.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2003	4	4					451	473		10.1207/S15327078IN0404_01	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0404_01													WOS:000187581600001

J	Muir, D; Lee, K				Muir, D; Lee, K			The still-face effect: Methodological issues and new applications	INFANCY												Over the last 25 years, the seemingly simple still-face phenomenon has elicited a tremendous amount of empirical and theoretical work. Adamson and Frick (2003/this issue) provide a comprehensive review and in-depth analysis of this large body of research. In our commentary, we focus on 3 major points. First, we described several methods to define operationally the still-face effect. Second, we noted the important role of adult touch in the still-face procedure, and that the effect can be reproduced without adult touch, by live, televised and "virtual" adult faces-making it a true "still-face" effect. Third, we emphasized a major methodological strength of the still-face procedure: the use of multiple response measures. By measuring both infant visual attention and affect responses, adaptations of the still-face procedure provide infant researchers with a powerful general method for studying the development of infant social competence.																			1525-0008						2003	4	4					483	491		10.1207/S15327078IN0404_03	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0404_03													WOS:000187581600003

With benefit of their review, one can identify several potentially important components of the still-face paradigm that have been neglected in past research. These are the influence of the still face on parent and infant behavior during the reunion episode and expanded measurement of the still-face effect to include theoretically important components of facial expression and the temporal organization of parent and infant behavior and physiology. In particular, by expanding what is meant by the still-face effect to encompass aspects of the reunion episode, we may discover robust probes into the parent-infant relationship and individual differences in infant attachment and emotion regulation extending across infancy and childhood.																			1525-0008						2003	4	4					493	497		10.1207/S15327078IN0404_04	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0404_04													WOS:000187581600004

J	Irwin, JR				Irwin, JR			Parent and nonparent perception of the multimodal infant cry	INFANCY												This study examined whether perceivers can detect infant distress in the visual and acoustic signals within the cry. Parent and nonparent perceivers rated distress in 3-, 6-, 8-, and 12-month-old infants' cries that were manipulated to separate facial, vocal, and bodily action. Mean perceiver ratings differed for high- and low-distress cries at each infant age on the basis of facial and vocal action, but not bodily movement. Perceivers rated the cry sound as more distressed and the cry face as less distressed with increasing infant age. Parents rated the cries as less distressed overall than did nonparents. The results suggest that information about distress is available for perceivers in the crying infant's face and voice.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2003	4	4					503	516		10.1207/S15327078IN0404_06	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0404_06													WOS:000187581600006

Participants were 90 primiparous mothers and their infants. Mothers completed questionnaires about remembered care from their own parents and their depressive symptoms prenatally, infant temperament (distress to novelty and distress to limitations), and depressive symptoms postnatally. Mothers and infants participated in a laboratory assessment of infant temperament (distress to novelty and limitations) and maternal sensitivity at 6 months postpartum. Several factors that moderate the degree of concordance between maternal reports and behavioral observations were identified, as predicted. Novelty concordance was higher when mothers reported having their emotional needs met in childhood and low prenatal depressive symptoms. Limitations concordance was higher when mothers were less sensitive during the observational tasks. Methodological and theoretical implications are discussed.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2003	4	4					517	539		10.1207/S15327078IN0404_07	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0404_07													WOS:000187581600007

More than 150 infants were visited at home with their mothers, two thirds of whom were depressed. These visits yielded 4 different observational measures of positive and negative emotionality at both 6 and 9 months. These were standard assessments (based on LabTab), naturalistic interactions, atypical reactions to the standard assessments, and the still-face procedure. Atypical reactions were consistently related to traditional measures of emotionality. Responses to the still-face procedure also generally cohered with the other measures. Aggregation improved agreement between mothers and observers. Depressed mothers' reports of negative emotionality were less accurate at 6 months than those of nondepressed mothers. Parenting experience appeared to be associated with greater maternal accuracy. Taken together the findings provide some support for both sides of the controversy surrounding the validity of maternal reports.

In addition, little is known about the stability of individual differences in attention across cognitive and social contexts. In this study, a cross-sectional sample of 50 infants (4 and 6 months of age) were first tested in a look duration and reaction time task with static visual stimuli. Next, their mothers participated with the infants in the still-face procedure, a mildly distressing social interaction paradigm that involves violation of expectancy. Individual differences in looking and emotion were stable across the phases of the still-face task. Further, individual differences in looking measures from the visual attention task were related to the pattern of looking shown across the phases of the still-face procedure. Results indicate that individual differences in attentional measures show moderate stability within cognitive and social contexts, and that the ability of infants to shift and disengage looks may affect their ability to regulate interaction in social contexts.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2003	4	4					567	588																WOS:000187581600009

A total of 497 mothers from a prospective cohort study were recruited during the last trimester of pregnancy. Infants were evaluated at 3 days with the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Scale. Maternal PND was assessed at 6 weeks postpartum with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Behavioral characteristics of the infant predicted the occurrence of PND, independent of other risk factors for PND: The lower the infants' orientation performance, the higher the risk that the mother would present with PND 6 weeks after delivery. As orientation capacities play a key role in the interactional skills developed between mothers and their infants, an infant who is difficult to engage in interaction may contribute to the risk of PND.					, sutter-dallay/S-9232-2019; Verdoux, Helene/T-1996-2019														1525-0008	1532-7078					2003	4	4					589	602		10.1207/S15327078IN0404_10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0404_10													WOS:000187581600010

Therefore, this study examined the contributions of caregiver behavior and temperament to infant joint attention development between 9 and 12 months. Data were collected from 57 infants using a caregiver-infant paradigm, an infant-tester paradigm, and a parent report of infant temperament. Nine-month measures of caregiver scaffolding and infant initiating joint attention (IJA) with testers were significantly related to 12-month infant IJA with testers. A temperament measure of positive emotional reactivity was related to 9-month IJA, and a measure of negative emotional reactivity was related to 12-month IJA. Temperament and caregiver scaffolding measures, however, were not associated with the development of infant responding to joint attention. These results further the understanding of the multiple processes that contribute to joint attention development in infancy, and support the hypothesis that initiating and responding measures tap different aspects of joint attention development.

Infants' Ability to Learn Phonetically Similar Words: Effects of Age and Vocabulary Size	INFANCY												What do novice word learners know about the sound of words? Word-learning tasks suggest that young infants (14 months old) confuse similar-sounding words, whereas mispronunciation detection tasks suggest that slightly older infants (18-24 months old) correctly distinguish similar words. Here we explore whether the difficulty at 14 months stems from infants' novice status as word learners or whether it is inherent in the task demands of learning new words. Results from 3 experiments support a developmental explanation. In Experiment 1, infants of 20 months learned to pair 2 phonetically similar words to 2 different objects under precisely the same conditions that infants of 14 months (Experiment 2) failed. In Experiment 3, infants of 17 months showed intermediate, but still successful, performance in the task. Vocabulary size predicted word-learning performance, but only in the younger, less experienced word learners. The implications of these results for theories of word learning and lexical representation are discussed.

Development of Tactile Responses in Human Preterm and Full-Term Infants From 30 to 40 Weeks Postconceptional Age	INFANCY												Maturation of tactile sensitivity prior to term was examined in 36 preterm and 13 full-term infants using a fixed-trial, habituation procedure. Each infant was presented with a series of 8 habituation (arm stroke), 2 novel (arm lift), and 2 recovery (arm stroke) stimulus trials while heart rate and body movements were recorded. Maturation was observed with a gradual increase in the magnitude of the stimulus-elicited cardiac acceleration and cardiac-movement coupling from 30 to 40 weeks postconceptional age. The majority of infants displayed habituation-an excitatory response (heart rate acceleration and body movement)-to the initial presentation of a tactile stimulus, response decline with repeated stimulations, and renewed response to a novel stimulus. A substantial number of infants (40%) failed to respond initially to the tactile stimulus, increased responding over several stimulus presentations, and failed to discriminate the presentation of a novel stimulus. We speculate that these differences in response patterns observed over all ages represent individual difference in the perception of stimulus intensity.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2002	3	1					31	51		10.1207/S15327078IN0301_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0301_2													WOS:000204990100002

Participants were 45 mother-infant dyads ( 19 cocaine exposed and 26 control infants) recruited at birth. Observations and maternal reports of infant behavior were obtained at 2 and 7 months of age, along with measures of pre- and postnatal substance use, maternal functioning, and caregiving stability. Maternal cocaine use accounted for significant variance in infant positive affect at 2 months. Other substance use and gestational age predicted infant distress to novelty and arousal during developmental assessments. At 7 months, the impact of prenatal cocaine exposure on infant affect regulation was mediated by postnatal alcohol use and caregiving stability. These findings, if replicated, suggest that 1 pathway to later problem behavior reported among substance-exposed children may be through early regulatory problems and the quality of postnatal caregiving.

J	Bennett, DS; Bendersky, M; Lewis, M				Bennett, David S.; Bendersky, Margaret; Lewis, Michael			Facial Expressivity at 4 Months: A Context by Expression Analysis	INFANCY												The specificity predicted by differential emotions theory (DET) for early facial expressions in response to 5 different eliciting situations was studied in a sample of 4-month- old infants (n = 150). Infants were videotaped during tickle, sour taste, jack-in-the-box, arm restraint, and masked-stranger situations and their expressions were coded second by second. Infants showed a variety of facial expressions in each situation; however, more infants exhibited positive (joy and surprise) than negative expressions (anger, disgust, fear, and sadness) across all situations except sour taste. Consistent with DET-predicted specificity, joy expressions were the most common in response to tickling, and were less common in response to other situations. Surprise expressions were the most common in response to the jack-in-the-box, as predicted, but also were the most common in response to the arm restraint and masked-stranger situations, indicating a lack of specificity. No evidence of predicted specificity was found for anger, disgust, fear, and sadness expressions. Evidence of individual differences in expressivity within situations, as well as stability in the pattern across situations, underscores the need to examine both child and contextual factors in studying emotional development. The results provide little support for the DET postulate of situational specificity and suggest that a synthesis of differential emotions and dynamic systems theories of emotional expression should be considered.

Maternal Depressive Symptoms and 6-Month-Old Infants' Sensitivity to Facial Expressions	INFANCY												We examined 6-month-old infants' abilities to discriminate smiling and frowning from neutral stimuli. In addition, we assessed the relationship between infants' preferences for varying intensities of smiling and frowning facial expressions and their mothers' history of depressive symptoms. Forty-six infants were presented pairs of facial expressions, and their preferential looking time was recorded. They also participated in a 3-min interaction with their mothers for which duration of both mother and infant gazing and smiling were coded. Analyses revealed that the infants reliably discriminated between varying intensities of smiling and frowning facial expressions and a paired neutral expression. In addition, infants' preferences for smiling and frowning expressions were related to self-reports of maternal depressive symptoms experienced since the birth of the infant. Potential implications for social cognitive development are discussed.

The Effect of Excessive Crying on the Development of Emotion Regulation	INFANCY												The goal of this study was to examine the effect of excessive crying in early infancy on the development of emotion self-regulation. Cry diaries were used to categorize excessive criers and typical criers at 6 weeks of age. At 5 and 10 months of age, infants and mothers participated in procedures to elicit infant reactivity and regulation during a frustration task and maternal sensitivity and intrusiveness during a free-play session. Last, maternal ratings of temperament were obtained. Results revealed excessive criers to show higher levels of negative reactivity than typical criers. Excessive criers also demonstrated lower regulation, but this finding was only significant for male infants. Boys in the excessive criers group exhibited the lowest level of emotion self-regulation. Maternal behavior and ratings of temperament at 5 and 10 months failed to distinguish the 2 cry groups. The findings suggest that excessive crying may influence the developmental trajectory of the ability of boys to self-regulate emotion. The hypothesized processes involved in this outcome are discussed.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2002	3	2					133	152		10.1207/S15327078IN0302_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0302_2								33451205					WOS:000204990200002

Infants' Behavioral Strategies for Emotion Regulation With Fathers and Mothers: Associations With Emotional Expressions and Attachment Quality	INFANCY												This study examined 12- and 13-month-old infants' behavioral strategies for emotion regulation, emotional expressions, regulatory styles, and attachment quality with fathers and mothers. Eighty-five infants participated in the Strange Situation procedure to assess attachment quality with mothers and fathers. Infants' behavioral strategies for emotion regulation were examined with each parent during a competing demands task. Emotion regulation styles were meaningfully related to infant-father attachment quality. Although expressions of distress and positive affect were not consistent across mothers and fathers, there was consistency in infant strategy use, emotion regulation style, and attachment quality with mothers and fathers. Furthermore, infants who were securely attached to both parents showed greater consistency in parent-oriented strategies than infants who were insecurely attached to one or both parents. Limitations of this study include the constrained laboratory setting, potential carryover effects, and a homogeneous, middle-class sample.

Frustration in Infancy: Implications for Emotion Regulation, Physiological Processes, and Temperament	INFANCY												A study sample of 162 six-month-old children was selected from a larger sample of 346 infants on the basis of parents' report of their infants' temperament and a laboratory assessment of temperament. Infants were classified as easily frustrated and less easily frustrated and compared on a number of emotion regulation, physiology, and temperament measures. Results indicated that male and female infants were equally likely to be classified as frustrated and less easily frustrated; however, male infants were less able to regulate physiologically. Easily frustrated infants used different emotion regulation strategies and were observed to be less attentive and more active than less easily frustrated infants when observed in the laboratory. These infants were also characterized by their parents as more active, less attentive, and more distressed to novelty. Infants classified as easily frustrated were more reactive physiologically and less able to regulate physiological reactivity than their less easily frustrated counterparts. It is hypothesized that this cluster of characteristics may constitute a unique temperamental type that may have implications for other types of behavioral functioning. Limitations of the study are that observations are based on a single brief assessment of the infant, modest effect sizes were found, and the study is cross-sectional.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2002	3	2					175	197		10.1207/S15327078IN0302_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0302_4								33451201					WOS:000204990200004

Mother-Child Coregulation During Delay of Gratification at 30 Months	INFANCY												Fifty-eight 30-month-old children and their mothers were observed during a task in which the child was asked to refrain from touching an attractive toy. Child and maternal regulatory strategies were independently coded in 5-sec intervals. Consistent with past research, the ability to refrain from touching the toy was associated with less time orienting to the forbidden object and more time focusing on other stimuli. Mothers of children who refrained from touching the toy were more likely to use distraction as a technique to assist in their children's regulation than were mothers of touchers, whereas mothers of children who transgressed used more nondistracting strategies than did mothers of nontouchers. Analysis of contingent behaviors suggested that mothers and children effectively coregulated behavior during this challenging situation, as children and mothers followed one another's lead in the allocation of attention away from the toy. These findings indicate the benefits of proactive, rather than reactive, parental strategies for assisting child delay of gratification.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2002	3	2					209	225		10.1207/S15327078IN0302_6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0302_6								33451206					WOS:000204990200006

The Development of Maternal Self-Efficacy and Its Impact on Maternal Behavior	INFANCY												A developmental model of the origins of maternal self-efficacy and its impact on maternal sensitivity was tested. Participants were 92 primiparous mothers and their 6-month-old infants. Mothers completed questionnaires about remembered care from their own parents and self-esteem prenatally, satisfaction with support, infant temperament, and maternal self-efficacy postnatally, and they participated in a laboratory observation with their infants. Maternal self-efficacy was predicted by remembered maternal care as mediated by global self-esteem. Infant soothability predicted maternal self-efficacy independently and in conjunction with distress to novelty and in conjunction with both distress to limits and satisfaction with support. Maternal self-efficacy interacted with distress to limits to predict maternal sensitivity during emotionally arousing activities. High infant distress was associated with less sensitive maternal behavior when maternal self-efficacy was moderately low and extremely high, but was positively associated with sensitive maternal behavior when self-efficacy was moderately high. Implications for future research are discussed.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2002	3	2					227	247		10.1207/S15327078IN0302_7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0302_7								33451204					WOS:000204990200007

Each participant listens to a series of short familiarization test trials. In each trial, 5 to 7 centrally-presented familiarization stimuli are followed by laterally-presented test stimuli. Infants were found to orient faster to different-category than to same-category test stimuli. This result was found despite a high degree of prosodic variability in the familiarization and test stimuli introduced by changes in talker and speaking rate. The combination of a multitrial design with use of acoustic and prosodic variability seems suitable for studying the representation of phonological categories.

Hierarchical multiple regression analyses indicated that infants who showed more attentional regulation during the still-face situation with mothers later showed a higher rate of committed compliance and a lower rate of situational compliance during cleanup with mothers. Furthermore, lower levels of attentional regulation were later associated with higher rates of assertive behavior, but only for infants in an insecure attachment relationship.																			1525-0008						2002	3	2					261	273		10.1207/S15327078IN0302_9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0302_9								33451200					WOS:000204990200009
J	Dannemiller, JL				Dannemiller, James L.			Relative Color Contrast Drives Competition in Early Exogenous Orienting	INFANCY												Young infants typically orient to a moving object, but the strength of this tendency depends on what else is in the visual field, with some objects competing for attention more effectively than others. This competition was studied in 3.5-month-old infants by manipulating the colors and spatial distributions of static elements that appeared with a small moving probe. The hypothesis was that the competition from these static bars would depend on their color contrasts. Three different color pairings were used: red with green, pink with green, and red with pink. The results were generally consistent with the hypothesis that the competition from static elements in the visual field depends on their color contrasts. Orienting at 3.5 months is determined by competition mechanisms that weight motion and color and most probably other stimulus characteristics to produce a directional response.																			1525-0008						2002	3	3					275	301		10.1207/S15327078IN0303_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0303_1								33451219					WOS:000204990300001

Ninety-six 3-month-olds watched an event sequence in which pictures appeared at 3 locations, either in regular left-center-right alternation or in a random center-side pattern. For half of the infants, the content of the central picture was predictive of the location of the upcoming peripheral event. Analyses of anticipations and interpicture fixation shifts revealed that both spatiotemporal regularity and consistent interevent contingencies fostered increased anticipation of peripheral pictures. The type of spatiotemporal sequence that infants observed also differentially biased their responses to test trials that followed the picture sequence: Infants who experienced regular alternation sequences continued the side-to-side pattern during the 2-choice test trials, whereas infants who experienced irregular sequences looked back to the location of the previous picture. Stable interevent contingencies, in contrast, did not bias infants' responses toward the contingent side during the choice test trials.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2002	3	3					303	321		10.1207/S15327078IN0303_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0303_2								33451215					WOS:000204990300002

Young Infants' Performance in the Object-Variation Version of the Above-Below Categorization Task: A Result of Perceptual Distraction or Conceptual Limitation?	INFANCY												Five experiments were conducted to examine the performance of young infants on above versus below categorization tasks. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that infants did not form abstract categorical representations for above and below when familiarized with different objects depicted in a constant spatial relation relative to a horizontal bar and tested on a novel object depicted in the familiar and novel spatial relation. Experiments 3 through 5 examined perceptual-attentional distraction versus conceptually based generalization explanations for young infant performance in the object-variation version of the above-below categorization task. Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrated that infants still did not form abstract categorical representations for above and below when object variation was removed from the familiarization trials or when object novelty was reduced during the preference test trials. However, Experiment 5 showed that 3- and 4-month-olds succeeded on the above versus below categorization task when familiarized with object variation and preference tested with a familiar versus novel object-bar relation. These results indicate that young infants can form categorical representations for above and below in the object-variation version of the above-below categorization task, but that such representations are specific to the particular objects presented. Young infant performance in the object-variation version of the above-below categorization task thus reflects a conceptually based generalization limit rather than a problem of perceptual-attentional distraction.																			1525-0008						2002	3	3					323	347		10.1207/S15327078IN0303_3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0303_3								33451220					WOS:000204990300003

The Effects of Alcohol in Breast Milk on Infant Behavioral State and Mother-Infant Feeding Interactions	INFANCY												The short-term impact of infant exposure to alcohol in breast milk on mother-infant interactions and infant arousal was examined. Fourteen mother-infant dyads were tested on 2 occasions that consisted of an alcohol administration and a nonalcohol condition. Mother-infant interactions during feeding were videotaped and coded for dyadic reciprocity, maternal noncontingency, and dyadic conflict. Infants were observed for 1 hr after receiving either plain breast milk or breast milk containing alcohol. Behavioral state, startles, and tremors were recorded every 30 sec. Mother-infant interactions were characterized by higher noncontingency and dyadic conflict in the alcohol condition. After drinking breast milk containing alcohol, infants changed behavioral state more often, startled more, and spent less time in quiet sleep and more time in quiet alert and crying states. These findings suggest that exposure to breast milk containing alcohol may not have a sedating effect, as commonly believed.

J	Singh, L; Morgan, JL; Best, CT				Singh, Leher; Morgan, James L.; Best, Catherine T.			Infants' Listening Preferences: Baby Talk or Happy Talk?	INFANCY												The most robust finding on infants' listening preferences has been widely characterized as a preference for baby talk (BT) over adult-directed speech (ADS). Although prosodic modifications characteristic of BT also convey positive affect, differences in affect across BT and ADS speech registers have not been controlled in previous studies. This set of experiments sought to elucidate the basis for 6-month-olds' listening preference by independently manipulating affect and speech register. When affect was held constant, no preference for any speech register was observed. Moreover, when ADS stimuli presented more positive affect than BT stimuli, infants' preferences followed the positive affect. Higher and more variable pitch was neither necessary nor sufficient for determining infants' preferences, although pitch characteristics may modulate affect-based preferences. The BT preference is thus attributable to a more general preference for speech that imparts relatively positive affect, a preference perhaps ascribable to a preexisting general-purpose mechanism opportunistically exploited by language.

Emotion Regulation in Context: Situational Effects on Infant and Caregiver Behavior	INFANCY												Emotion regulation is an important developmental task of the early years of life. However, situational effects are rarely examined. In this study, we evaluated situational effects on 7-month-olds' and their mothers' emotional expression and interactive regulation behavior, individual differences across situations, and intercorrelations within situations. Mother-infant dyads (N (-) 225) were observed interacting during episodes from play, teaching, and still-face situations that varied along 2 developmentally salient dimensions: emotional challenge (low vs. high), and attentional focus (face-to-face vs. object). Attentional focus affected mothers' behavior, whereas both challenge and attentional focus affected infants. Associations between mother and infant behaviors varied in each situation. High-challenge situations provided more consistent individual differences in infants and more negative behavior from mothers. Findings have implications for appropriate assessment of emotion regulation in infancy.

Speed of Processing and Face Recognition at 7 and 12 Months	INFANCY												This research examined developmental and individual differences in infants' speed of processing faces and the relation of processing speed to the type of information encoded. To gauge processing speed, 7- and 12-month-olds were repeatedly presented with the same face ( frontal view), each time paired with a new one, until they showed a consistent preference for the new one. Subsequent probe trials assessed recognition of targets that either preserved configural integrity (Study 1: 3/4 profile and full profile poses) or disrupted it while preserving featural information ( Study 2: rotations of 160 degrees or 200 degrees and fracturings). There were developmental differences in both speed and in infants' appreciation of information about faces. Older infants took about 60% fewer trials to reach criterion and had more mature patterns of attention (i.e., looks of shorter duration and more shifts of gaze). Whereas infants of both ages recognized the familiar face in a 3/4 pose, the 12-month-olds also recognized it in profile and when rotated. Twelve-month-olds who were fast processors additionally recognized the fractured faces; otherwise, processing speed was unrelated to the type of information extracted. At 7 months then, infants made use of some configural information in processing faces; at 12 months, they made use of even more of the configural information, along with part-based or featural information.																			1525-0008						2002	3	4					435	455		10.1207/S15327078IN0304_02	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0304_02													WOS:000204990400002

Infants' Use of Constraints to Speed Information Processing and to Anticipate Events	INFANCY												Two experiments were conducted with 28-week-old infants using a modification of the Visual Expectation Paradigm. The first sought to determine whether speed of information processing (SIP) could be assessed in infants using a reaction time (RT) measure and approach that is widely used to measure SIP in adults. Infants saw a center fixation cue followed by a peripheral target that could appear in 1, 2, or 4 locations. There was a linear increase in RT of eye movements as the number of locations increased from 1 to 2 and to 4 targets, suggesting that the paradigm does measure SIP. The second experiment asked whether varying the number of cue-target pairings would augment or impair infant's SIP in the trade-off between the benefit of additional information and the liability of additional memory load. The findings showed that the presence of cue information can eliminate the difference in RT between the 1-and 2-location conditions, whereas no benefit of cue was obtained for the 4-location condition.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2002	3	4					457	473		10.1207/S15327078IN0304_03	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0304_03													WOS:000204990400003

Prenatal Cardiac Function and Postnatal Cognitive Development: An Exploratory Study	INFANCY												Fetal cardiac function was measured at 24, 30, and 36 weeks gestation and quantified in terms of heart rate, variability, and episodic accelerations. Children's representational capacity was evaluated at 27 months in terms of language and play. Thirty-and 36-week-old fetuses that displayed greater heart-rate variability and more episodic accelerations, and fetuses that exhibited a more precipitous increase in heart-rate variability and acceleration over gestation achieved higher levels of language competence. Thirty-six-week-old fetuses with higher heart-rate variability and accelerations, and steeper growth trajectories over gestation, achieved higher levels of symbolic play. Cardiac patterning during gestation may reflect an underlying neural substrate that persists through early childhood: Individual variation in rate of development could be stable, or efficient cardiac function could positively influence the underlying neural substrate to enhance cognitive performance.

The Development of Anticipatory Postural Adjustments in Infancy	INFANCY												Efficient voluntary action requires postural adjustments that compensate for potential balance disturbances before they occur. These anticipatory postural adjustments have been widely investigated in adults, but relatively little is known about their development, especially during infancy. This study examined the early development of anticipatory postural activity in support of pulling action while standing. A total of 34 infants between 10 and 17 months were tested. The task required infants to open a cabinet drawer to retrieve toys while a force resisting the pulling action was applied to the drawer. The experiment included between 9 and 13 pulling trials. The force resisting the pull was doubled after the first 4 initial trials and returned again to its original value after another 4 trials. Electromyographic activity from the gastrocnemius and biceps brachii muscles was recorded. The proportion of pulls involving anticipatory activity in the gastrocnemius muscles progressively increased between 10 and 17 months. In addition, infants with considerable experience in opening drawers learned to recruit greater strength of their anticipatory postural adjustments for heavier pulls. Implications for the role of motoric experience in anticipatory postural activity are discussed.

The Effect of the Number of A Trials on Performance on the A-Not-B Task	INFANCY												The A-not-B error (Piaget, 1954), which occurs when infants search perseveratively on reversal trials in a delayed-response task, is one of the most widely studied phenomena in developmental psychology. Nonetheless, the effect of A-trial experience on the probability and magnitude of this error remains unclear. In this study, 9-month-old infants were tested at location A until they searched correctly on 1, 6, or 11 A trials. Results revealed an effect of A trials on the proportion of infants who erred on the first B trial, and on the number of errors prior to a correct search at B (i.e., the error run). These effects were asymptotic, or U-shaped, consistent with a dual-process model according to which A-trial experience increases habit strength but also provides opportunities for reflection on task structure.

Infants' Responses to Gender-Inconsistent Events	INFANCY												Toddlers' knowledge of the stereotyping of traditionally feminine and masculine household activities was examined using the preferential looking paradigm. Seventy-seven 24-month-old infants observed a series of 9 pairs of photographs, each portraying a male and female adult engaged in the same stereotyped or gender-neutral activity (e.g., ironing, hammering, or reading). Longer looking times were predicted on stimuli inconsistent with gender stereotypes (e. g., looking longer at the man putting on lipstick than at the woman). The results suggested that toddlers have acquired some knowledge of the gender stereotyping of feminine activities by their 2nd birthday.					serbin, lisa/F-3979-2011														1525-0008						2002	3	4					531	542		10.1207/S15327078IN0304_07	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0304_07													WOS:000204990400007

Relations Between Measures of Irritability and Contingency Detection at 6 Months	INFANCY												The hypothesis that irritability and contingency detection are negatively correlated was examined in thirty-one 6-month-old infants. Observation and maternal report-based assessments of irritability were correlated with both a criterion score and a continuous score of contingency detection. Results indicated that greater irritability in infants was associated with lower contingency detection scores. Discussion focuses on identifying processes by which the 2 constructs may be associated.

J	Schafer, G; Mareschal, D				Schafer, Graham; Mareschal, Denis			Modeling Infant Speech Sound Discrimination Using Simple Associative Networks	INFANCY												Infants' responses in speech sound discrimination tasks can be nonmonotonic over time. Stager and Werker (1997) reported such data in a bimodal habituation task. In this task, 8-month-old infants were capable of discriminations that involved minimal contrast pairs, whereas 14-month-old infants were not. It was argued that the older infants' attenuated performance was linked to their processing of the stimuli for meaning. The authors suggested that these data are diagnostic of a qualitative shift in infant cognition. We describe an associative connectionist model showing a similar decrement in discrimination without any qualitative shift in processing. The model suggests that responses to phonemic contrasts may be a nonmonotonic function of experience with language. The implications of this idea are discussed. The model also provides a formal framework for studying habituation-dishabituation behaviors in infancy.

J	Bosch, L; Sebastián-Gallés, N				Bosch, Laura; Sebastian-Galles, Nuria			Evidence of Early Language Discrimination Abilities in Infants From Bilingual Environments	INFANCY												Previous research data indicate that soon after birth, infants from monolingual families can discriminate utterances drawn from languages that differ prosodically, but discrimination between rhythmically similar languages, such as English and Dutch, has not yet been established by 2 months of age. In the case of bilinguals, the question of how early they can distinguish between the languages of exposure remains unanswered. The goal of this study was to analyze language discrimination capacities in 4-month-old bilingual infants simultaneously exposed to 2 Romance languages belonging to the same rhythmic category, Spanish and Catalan. Using a familiarization-preference procedure, 2 groups of bilingual-to-be infants showed a capacity to discriminate between these 2 familial languages. Moreover, when compared with 2 groups of infants from monolingual environments, the size of the observed effects was the same. These results can be taken as initial evidence of an early capacity to distinguish languages in simultaneous bilingual exposure, thus challenging the hypothesis that language discrimination capacities are delayed in bilinguals.

The Development of Visual-Tactual Perception of Objects: Amodal Relations Provide the Basis for Learning Arbitrary Relations	INFANCY												Infants of 4 and 6 months were familiarized with an object visually and tactually and then tested for visual-tactual matching on the basis of amodal and arbitrary relations or arbitrary relations only (Experiment 1). Results indicated that both the 4-and the 6-month-olds were capable of matching when amodal information specifying the common shape of the visual and tactual stimulation was available during test. In contrast, only the 6-month-olds were capable of matching on the basis of arbitrary relations between the haptically experienced shape of the object and its color or pattern. A control study (Experiment 2) demonstrated that the 4-month-olds were, in fact, able to discriminate the colors or patterns used. Results were interpreted as consistent with findings in the area of audiovisual event perception, demonstrating a developmental lag between detection of amodal and arbitrary relations. Finally, Experiment 3 explored the basis for 6-month-olds' detection of the arbitrary relations in Experiment 1. Results demonstrated that when amodal information for shape was eliminated during familiarization, infants were no longer able to match on the basis of arbitrary relations. These findings are consistent with an invariant-detection view and suggest that amodal information can serve as a basis for learning about arbitrary relations.

What's in a Name When It Isn't a Word? 17-Month-Olds' Mapping of Nonverbal Symbols to Object Categories	INFANCY												Infants begin acquiring object labels as early as 12 months of age. Recent research has indicated that the ability to acquire object names extends beyond verbal labels to other symbolic forms, such as gestures. This experiment examines the latitude of infants' early naming abilities. We tested 17-month-olds' ability to map gestures, nonverbal sounds, and pictograms to object categories using a forced-choice triad task. Results indicated that infants accept a wide range of symbolic forms as object names when they are embedded in familiar referential naming routines. These data suggest that infants may initially have no priority for words over other symbolic forms as object names, although the relative status of words appears to change with development. The implications of these findings for the development of criteria for determining whether a symbol constitutes an object name early in development are considered.

J	Hsu, HC; Fogel, A				Hsu, Hui-Chin; Fogel, Alan			Infant Vocal Development in a Dynamic Mother-Infant Communication System	INFANCY												This study is an investigation of the development of infant vocalization in a changing and dynamic mother-infant communication system. Thirteen infants and their mothers were observed weekly from 4 to 24 weeks of age in a face-to-face interaction situation. Three patterns of mother-infant communication dynamics were classified: symmetrical (mutual engagement by mother and infant), asymmetrical (mother active while infant inactive), and unilateral (mother active while infant disengaged). Two types of infant nondistress vocalizations were categorized: syllabic (speechlike) and vocalic (nonspeechlike) vocalizations. It was hypothesized that the quantity and quality of infant nondistress vocalizations are associated with the patterns of mother-infant communication and that these associations change developmentally. The results demonstrated that the rates of syllabic and vocalic vocalizations were positively associated with symmetrical communication but negatively associated with unilateral communication. Syllabic vocalizations were more likely to occur in symmetrical mother-infant communication. Developmentally, whereas a curvilinear growth pattern (inverted U shape) of the rate of syllabic vocalizations was found in symmetrical communication, a linear increase was found in unilateral communication. A relational approach to infant vocal development in a changing and dynamic communicative context is discussed.																			1525-0008	1532-7078					2001	2	1					87	109		10.1207/S15327078IN0201_6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0201_6								33451227					WOS:000204989600006

In TP and MO, a female model alternated between demonstrating the gesture for 20 sec and presenting a passive, motionless face for 20 sec. In CO, she presented a passive face in both the "demonstration" and "passive" intervals. The participants' eyes were more widely open in the demonstration intervals of TP and MO than in the passive intervals, indicating that they were attending to the gestures. In TP, the participants produced more TP responses than MO responses, but in MO there was no effect, undermining the neonatal imitation hypothesis.					sommer, iris/D-1190-2014														1525-0008						2001	2	1					111	122		10.1207/S15327078IN0201_7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0201_7								33451226					WOS:000204989600007

Cortical Indexes of Saccade Planning Following Covert Orienting in 20-Week-Old Infants	INFANCY												This study examined scalp-recorded, event-related potential (ERP) indexes of saccade planning in 20-week-old infants. A spatial cuing procedure was used in which the infants were presented with a central fixation stimulus and a peripheral cue. A peripheral target followed the cue on the ipsilateral or contralateral side of the cue. The procedure resulted in covert orienting of attention in these participants, reflected in behavioral (e.g., response facilitation or inhibition of return depending on cue-target stimulus-onset asynchrony) and ERP (P1 facilitation to ipsilateral target) indexes of covert orienting of attention. A presaccadic ERP that occurred over the frontal cortex about 50 msec before the saccade onset was largest when the saccade was to a target in a cued location. A presaccadic ERP potential that occurred about 300 msec before the saccade onset was largest for the saccades toward the cued location whether the target was present or not. These results suggest that saccade planning occurs in infants at this age and that infant saccade planning is controlled by cortical systems.

Differential Frontal Cortex Activation Before Anticipatory and Reactive Saccades in Infants	INFANCY												Neural correlates of anticipatory and reactive saccades were studied in 4-month-old infants by recording high-density event-related potentials. Infants were presented with a fixed sequence of stimulus presentation to which they rapidly showed anticipatory saccades, as well as continuing with some reactive (stimulus-driven) saccades. As in a previous study, no clear evidence was found for adultlike, saccade-related potentials, although some presaccadic differences between reactive and anticipatory saccades were observed. Infants also showed different stimulus offset-related effects preceding the 2 types of trials with a right-frontal positivity when an anticipatory look follows, but only left-frontal positivity when a reactive saccade follows.

J	Wentworth, N; Haith, MM; Karrer, R				Wentworth, Naomi; Haith, Marshall M.; Karrer, Rathe			Behavioral and Cortical Measures of Infants' Visual Expectations	INFANCY												Features of the habituation paradigm were combined with the visual expectation paradigm to examine behavioral and cortical indexes of infants' visual expectations. Eight 3-month-old infants watched an alternating picture sequence while their eye movements were videotaped and their cortical electrophysiological activity (event-related potential [ERP]) was recorded. Two ERP epochs were examined: a 3,000-msec stimulus-locked epoch included 1,000 msec before stimulus onset through 1,000 msec after stimulus offset; and a 1,200-msec response-locked epoch included 700 msec before saccade onset through 500 msec after the saccade. All infants anticipated upcoming pictures, and eye movement latencies for pictures that were not anticipated were comparable to saccade latencies reported in other visual expectation studies of infants at this age. Three components were identified in the stimulus- locked ERP waveform: a slowly developing negativity prior to picture onset, a postonset negative slow wave, and a late negative deflection that peaked about 750 msec after picture onset. All stimulus- locked components were larger for familiar than for unfamiliar pictures; prestimulus negativity was also greater before anticipated pictures. The response-locked waveform contained 2 prominent features: a slowly increasing negative shift (NS) that began about 500 msec before saccade onset and a positive presaccadic potential that occurred about 30 to 90 msec before the saccade. Response-locked components were larger for anticipatory saccades at the frontal scalp site; for reactive saccades, response-locked components were larger at the vertex. Results are informative about ERPs in infants, cortical control of eye movements, and the development of visual expectations.																			1525-0008						2001	2	2					175	195		10.1207/S15327078IN0202_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S15327078IN0202_4													WOS:000204989800004
