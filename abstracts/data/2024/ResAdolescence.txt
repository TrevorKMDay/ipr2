The e-cigarette assessment for youth-Revised (EAsY-R): Preliminary results of a pilot study of measure refinement via cognitive interviewing	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The prevalence of youth vaping has, in a relatively short time, become an "epidemic." In the wake of such labeling by the Surgeon General, a number of important examinations of vaping have been conducted. These have largely focused on high school and college-age youth as this demographic shows the greatest prevalence of use. Nonetheless, no measure has been made available which might allow for the comprehensive assessment of quantity and frequency of vaping among this age group, thus aiding in standardization across settings. The current study utilized cognitive interviews with high school and college-age youth who use vaping devices to inform the preliminary development of such an assessment. The sample consists of eight students between the ages of 15 and 24 (Mage = 18.75, SD = 2.73, 62.5% female, 75.0% Hispanic/Latino/a/x, 100.0% White). Interviewing and measure refinement were conducted in a two-phase iterative fashion. Suggestions made during cognitive interviews resulted in the refinement of assessed content type, updated categories and pictures of vaping devices, as well as updated and age-relevant terminology. Further, instructions were streamlined, and assessment items and multiple-choice options were refined to maximize clarity and to minimize participant confusion. The result of this study, the E-Cigarette Assessment for Youth Revised, is a unique tool for standardizing examinations of the quantity and frequency of vaping behaviors among high school students and college-age youth.

The qualitative and longitudinal survey involved six participants who were members of two different families, as follows: four female adolescents, one adult woman, and one adult man. It was found that adolescents and their families understood work as a context for nurturing moral values, learning skills, and meeting needs. Observation, however, found that work also involved exposure to risks. The study reviews the role of work in adolescence as a cultural component in some rural contexts and how this should be taken into account to avoid an ethnocentric and universalistic interpretation that divides adolescence between "normal" and "abnormal."

In multilevel models assessing within-person change, boys gained female friends when they were in same-sex romantic relationships, compared to when they were single. In contrast, girls in same-sex relationships lost female friends and gained male friends. Adolescents in other-sex romantic relationships gained same-sex friends compared to when they were single. Results advance understanding of adolescent social and sexual development, suggesting that sexual minority adolescents find allies when dating but may struggle to maintain same-sex friendships.

This longitudinal study examined the within-person co-development of adolescents' autonomy and relationships with parents and friends. Adolescents (N = 244 M-age = 11.54, SD = 0.43 at T1; 50% boys) participated in a four-wave study across 2 years in the Netherlands. In random-intercept cross-lagged panel models, within-person results showed that higher levels of autonomy predicted less parental psychological control but not vice versa. However, no lagged-effects between friend support and autonomy were found. This study suggests that adolescents' autonomy steers changes in parental psychological control.

A Resistance Framework for Racially Minoritized Youth Behaviors During the Transition to Adulthood	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The transition from adolescence to adulthood is a challenging time marked by rapid changes in relational connections, housing status, and academic or work trajectories. We emphasize how structural inequality shapes racially minoritized youth behaviors and center the potential for resistance, arguing that a resistance lens allows us to deepen our understanding of the transition to adulthood for racially minoritized youth. Throughout the paper, we include research on how racially minoritized youth experience marginalizing institutional structures concurrently across multiple systems and their resulting behaviors. We end with the clinical and research implications of a resistance framework to illuminate resistance-informed responses such as rethinking risk and creating spaces for youth-led self-making, youth-adult partnerships to scaffold transitions, and cultivating youth activism.

Two studies tested a new model of cheating in high school. In Study 1, 85 high schoolers in the Western U.S. reported their perceptions, evaluations, and motivations surrounding their own and hypothetical cheating. In Study 2, 83 teachers reported their views about cheating; we also analyzed course syllabi. About half of the adolescents reported unintentional cheating, and many judged their own cheating-but not hypothetical cheating-as acceptable. Decisions to cheat were responses to competing pressures, low value placed on the assignment, and other considerations. Study 2 revealed teacher-student disagreements about cheating, and minimal content about academic integrity in syllabi. The findings supported the proposed model of adolescent cheating.

Daily Discrimination and Affect in Latinx Adolescent-Parent Dyads Residing in Northeast United States	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												In this 14-day study, we tested whether Latinx adolescents' (M-age = 12.76 years, 52% female; 52% U.S. born; N = 21) and parents' (95% female; 24% U.S. born) daily discrimination experiences were associated with their own and other's daily affective states. Results indicated that on days when adolescents reported discrimination, they reported higher negative affect and marginally lower positive affect and, interestingly, parents reported higher positive affect. On average (i.e., across the 2-week period), adolescents' discrimination was associated with higher adolescent negative affect and lower parent positive affect. Together, findings suggest that Latinx adolescents' discrimination experiences are linked to their own affective states and their parents'. Results underscore how discrimination is linked to the affective states present in family contexts.

Emotion Regulation (ER) may be an important protective resource for these adolescents. The present study tested the links between ER and internalizing and externalizing problems in 131 first- and second-generation Chinese American adolescents. Adolescents' reappraisal was associated with less internalizing and externalizing problems; adolescents' suppression was associated with more internalizing and externalizing problems. These links were somewhat more pronounced in adolescents high in American cultural orientation as well as in adolescents low in Chinese cultural orientation. Our results advance our understanding of the links between ER and psychological health in Chinese American youth.

Work and School Pathways Into the Transition to Adulthood: Adolescent Family, Individual, and Industry Precursors	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Many young adults in countries with advanced economies make linear career transitions from school to work. However, there is a great variability in youth's postsecondary education and early work experiences and more work is needed to identify the career trajectories of modern youth. Using longitudinal data on 1747 young adults from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth-1997, the current study identifies work and school pathways commonly seen in the transition to adulthood and investigates multiple levels of adolescent precursors. Using latent class analysis, we identified four work and school pathways centered on educational attainment. Whereas parental education and future educational expectations in adolescence significantly shaped the career pathways, local labor market conditions played a limited role in predicting these pathways.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2022	32	2			SI		785	804		10.1111/jora.12674	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12674		AUG 2021						34382291					WOS:000684031700001

Codevelopment of Delinquency, Alcohol Use, and Aggression Toward Peers and Dates: Multitrajectory Patterns and Predictors	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												We aimed to characterize developmental patterns of involvement in alcohol use, delinquency, and interpersonal aggression in a normative sample of adolescents by applying multitrajectory group-based modeling. Using seven waves of data from a cohort sequential study spanning the 6th to 12th grades (n = 2,825; 50% girls), we identified four distinct trajectory groups: low risk (33%), declining peer aggressors (44%), peer and dating aggressors (13%), and multidomain high risk (10%). Across all comparisons, girls were more likely than boys to be members of the peer and dating aggressor group and less likely to be members of the multidomain high-risk group. Moreover, individual (self-control, negative emotionality), family (family violence, parental monitoring), and peer (substance use norms) distinguished class membership.

Quantitative analyses examined how retaliatory desire and action were associated with variations in youths' lifetime exposure to violence (ETV) and recent victimization by peers at school. These measures of violence exposure were related to revenge only in the context of unforgiven harms. Qualitative analyses explored aspects of youths' narrative accounts that may underlie the observed associations. Overall, findings suggest that ETV may interfere with youths' capacity to reflect on revenge in ways that recognize their own fallibility and thus open the door to forgiveness.

We did not find that single universal trajectories characterized adolescent externalizing and internalizing symptoms across cultures, but instead found significant heterogeneity in starting points and rates of change in both externalizing and internalizing symptoms across cultures. Some similarities did emerge. Across many cultural groups, internalizing symptoms decreased from ages 8 to 10, and externalizing symptoms increased from ages 10 to 14. Parental warmth appears to function similarly in many cultures as a protective factor that prevents the onset and growth of adolescent externalizing and internalizing symptoms, whereas the effects of behavioral control vary from culture to culture.

Data were collected from 245 Portuguese adolescents (14-19 years old, 63% female) by using the experience sampling method. Multilevel modeling revealed that challenge-skill and positive affect were positively associated with optimal experience, while negative affect was negatively associated with optimal experience. Effortless attention mediated the associations between internal states and optimal experience, while activity and company only moderated some of these associations. These findings will inform practitioners about the factors that should be addressed in interventions with adolescents to promote optimal experiences in their lives.					; Faria, Susana/C-2176-2015; Freire, Teresa/D-6911-2012	Tavares, Dionisia/0000-0003-1115-0242; Faria, Susana/0000-0001-8014-9902; Freire, Teresa/0000-0001-5773-381X													1050-8392	1532-7795				MAR	2020	30	1					266	284		10.1111/jora.12522	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12522								31246377					WOS:000516654100018

Twenty semistructured, one-to-one interviews were conducted with mentors (n = 11) and mentees (n = 9) recruited from two different London local authorities. Participants' accounts were interpreted through a developmental lens to uncover developmental aspects and locus mechanisms through which transformative change took place. Resilience as a healthy outcome was the result of the dual function the mentoring relationship performed. The mentoring relationship was protective against the risks associated with transitioning to independent living and/or adulthood, and promoted internal assets and competencies whereby the mentees' ability to resist them was enhanced. Establishing a trustworthy connection with a role model promoted developmental domains within mentees.

We apply latent class analysis to nationally representative data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health; N = 10,149) to examine (1) what religiosity profiles exist among adolescents and (2) how they predict sexual behavior and romantic relationship status in adolescence and young adulthood. Religiosity in multiple domains was associated with lesser odds of sexual behavior compared to profiles marked by only affiliation, private, or public religiosity. Findings suggest that examining multiple facets of religiosity together is important for understanding how religiosity is associated with sexual behavior.

We conducted an analysis of bibliographic data, including titles, abstracts, keywords, indexing terms, and citation data to assess the sheer numbers, audience and reach, publication types, and impact of puberty-related publications. Findings suggest that puberty-related publications are increasing in sheer numbers, and have reach in many fields as befits an interdisciplinary science.

Sexual Behavior and Heavy Episodic Drinking Across the Transition to Adulthood: Differences by College Attendance	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Despite a growing literature on college students' sexual behaviors, little is known about how sexual behaviors, and their associations with alcohol, differ for college and noncollege attenders, and whether these patterns represent changes during college or an extension of pre-college behaviors. This paper applied time-varying effect models to data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health to examine (1) prevalence of four sexual behaviors from ages 14 to 24 and (2) how their association with frequent heavy episodic drinking varied across these ages for college and noncollege attenders. Nonattenders have higher prevalence of all sexual behaviors than college attenders across most ages; however, the association between heavy episodic drinking and sexual behaviors is stronger for college attenders during ages 18-20.

Role of Social Environmental Protective Factors on Anxiety and Depressive Symptoms Among Midwestern Homeless Youth	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												We employ a social stress framework, which examines the influence of multiple stressors (e.g., physical abuse, foster care placement) on an individual's ability to function (e.g., mental well-being), to longitudinally examine the effects of stressful life events on mental health and the role of the social environment in this process among 150 homeless youth. Results revealed that numerous stressors, such as physical abuse and running away from home more frequently, were associated with greater depressive symptoms and elevated anxiety. Having mentors and family and friends from home that youth can rely on resulted in more positive social support, which subsequently lowered the risk for depressive symptoms and anxiety at wave 2.

An Explanatory Model of Dating Violence Risk Factors in Spanish Adolescents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Dating violence is a serious public health issue that needs further understanding in terms of risk factors that may be involved in it. The main goal of this study was to test a mediational model of dating violence risk factors. The sample was composed of 477 secondary and college students from Spain (59% females). A dynamic developmental explanatory model considering aggressiveness, insecure attachment, interparental conflict, and peer dating violence was tested using a multigroup structural equationmodel. Aggressiveness partially mediated the relation between anxious attachment and dating violence and fully mediated the association between interparental conflict resolution and dating violence. Furthermore, perceived peer dating violence was a direct predictor of dating violence. Implications for prevention and intervention plans are discussed.					van de Vijver, Fons/A-4317-2012; Alonso-Arbiol, Itziar/B-5095-2011	Aizpitarte, Alazne/0000-0001-8074-8446; Alonso-Arbiol, Itziar/0000-0002-4638-085X													1050-8392	1532-7795				DEC	2017	27	4					797	809		10.1111/jora.12315	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12315								29152871					WOS:000415897400006

Using an accelerated longitudinal design and latent class growth analysis, we identified four subgroups of NSSI trajectories: negligible (74.6%), experimental (12.8%), moderate decreasing (10.8%), and high fluctuating (1.9%). Adolescents reporting both intrapersonal (i.e., impulsive behaviors and depression) and interpersonal (i.e., unstable relationships and parental criticism) risk factors were significantly more likely to follow the latter three trajectories. The findings of this study suggest there is heterogeneity in NSSI development among adolescents and highlight the contributions of both intrapersonal and interpersonal risk factors in the engagement in NSSI.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2017	27	2					392	406		10.1111/jora.12273	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12273								28876527					WOS:000401163500009

Data were collected from one cohort of seventh-grade middle school students (N = 754) from four schools. Using structural equation modeling, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses assessed measurement models and tested measurement invariance by gender for aggression measures. Analyses invoked baseline data only. Physical and psychological TDV perpetration measures achieved strict measurement invariance, while bullying perpetration demonstrated partial strict invariance. Electronic TDV and sexual harassment perpetration achieved metric/scalar invariance. Study findings lend validation to prior and future studies using these measures with similar populations. Future research should increase attention to measurement development, refinement, and testing among study measures.

Understanding the factors associated with forced sex is important for informing prevention programs aimed at reducing sexual violence and HIV and AIDS. Multilevel regression models test the association between sexual situation self-efficacy and forced sex among 2,893 South African adolescents. Findings suggest that youth are more likely to experience forced sex after periods of time when their levels of self-efficacy are lower than their average levels of self-efficacy. Furthermore, youth who are lower on their self-efficacy compared to their peers are more likely to experience forced sex. Implications for prevention research are discussed.

Harsh Parenting, Deviant Peers, Adolescent Risky Behavior: Understanding the Meditational Effect of Attitudes and Intentions	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Although research supports the influence of parents and peers on adolescent risky behavior, less is known about mechanisms proposed to explain this relation. This study examined the influence of adolescent attitudes and intentions about such behaviors. Prospective, longitudinal data came from rural youth who participated throughout adolescence (n = 451). Observed harsh parenting and relationship with deviant peers was assessed in early adolescence, attitudes and intentions were measured during middle adolescence, and risky behavior was assessed in late adolescence. Results indicated that parenting and deviant peers was related to engagement in tobacco use, alcohol use, and risky sexual behaviors. Moreover, attitudes and intentions mediated this relationship even after parent use and adolescent early involvement in these behaviors were taken into account.

Peer Influence on Prosocial Behavior in Adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Adolescence is a time of increased sensitivity to peer influence, which creates vulnerabilities but also opportunities. In this study, we examined the influence of peers on prosocial behavior in 12- to 16-year-old adolescents (N = 197). We utilized a public goods game in which participants made decisions about the allocation of coins between themselves and the group. Participants received manipulated peer feedback on a subset of decisions. Results indicate a significant interaction between feedback condition (prosocial, antisocial, or no feedback) and allocation choices: Prosocial behavior increased after prosocial feedback and decreased after antisocial feedback. These findings support the idea that peer influence creates not only vulnerabilities, but also opportunities for healthy prosocial development and social adjustment learning.

Negotiating Family Obligations and Educational Goals Among College-Enrolled Youth on Jeju Island, Korea	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This survey study examined the role of parents in the educational goals of 265 college-enrolled youth (1927years; M=22years; 64% female students) on Jeju Island, Korea. A model of shared agency was applied to identify the processes through which associations between family assistance and adjustment can be explained. Four factors of parental educational involvement were found: coactivity (consisting of autonomy support and collaboration), accommodation, noninvolvement, and directing. Results indicated that family assistance was positively related to adjustment and only coactivity was positively correlated to both family assistance and adjustment. Mediation analyses also indicated that youth's provision of family assistance was associated with lower levels of depression and higher satisfaction with life and educational progress through coactivity.

We find that the impacts of these welfare and anti-poverty programs on boys' and girls' developmental outcomes during the transition to early adolescence differ as a function of neighborhood poverty levels. The strongest positive impacts of these programs are among boys who lived in high-poverty neighborhoods at the time their parents enrolled in the studies, with smaller or nonstatistically significant effects for boys in lower-poverty neighborhoods and for girls across all neighborhoods. This research informs our understanding of how neighborhood context and child gender may interact with employment-based policies to affect children's well-being.

JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This longitudinal study was designed to investigate whether or not social connectedness predicts psychological well-being over time. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the temporal relations between these constructs assessed yearly for 3 similar to years for a sample of 1,774 10- to 15-year-olds (at Time 1). Results indicated that global connectedness (i.e., connectedness combined across the domains of family, school, peers, and neighborhood) predicted well-being, but no reciprocal relation was found. However, reciprocal relations were revealed by analyses that examined connectedness at the domain level, that is, for family and school contexts. The results suggest that youth who reported higher levels of social connectedness at one point in time would subsequently report higher well-being (i.e., life satisfaction, confidence, positive affect, and aspirations).

However, children's and adolescents' understanding of the concept of wisdom has hardly been investigated. In the current study, 80 children and adolescents completed a questionnaire concerning an event where they had been wise and an event where another person acted wisely. Most participants reported difficult life situations such as conflicts or accidents. In describing their wisdom, they focused on being empathic and supportive, which is likely related to their predominant developmental tasks. The persons described as wise were on average 29 years old. Contrary to expectations more females than men were described as wise. As expected, wisdom descriptions differed somewhat by gender and age group.

This study examined coping self-efficacy as a mediator of the relationship between peer victimization and psychological maladjustment in order to gain an understanding of this heterogeneity in children's responses to victimization. In this study, 2,161 children (1,071 females and 1,090 males), ranging in age from 10 to 15 years, 63% White, 17% Middle-Eastern, 10% Asian, and 10% from other ethnic groups, participated. Results from the mediational analysis revealed that four coping self-efficacy domains differentially mediated the relationship between peer victimization and social anxiety, cognitive depression, and externalizing symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of increasing children's coping self-efficacy for proactive behavior, avoiding self-blame, victim-role disengagement, and avoiding aggressive behavior in order to attenuate the negative psychological outcomes of peer harassment.

Social preference did not predict any of the risk behaviors assessed, although the interaction between gender and social preference was predictive of sexual behavior. Perceived popularity in Grade 10 was predictive of increased alcohol use and sexual activity in Grade 12 for both boys and girls. A reciprocal relationship was found for boys, in which smoking in Grade 10 also predicted gains in perceived popularity over time. Furthermore, results suggested that gains in perceived popularity may be associated with subsequent losses in social preference over time, lending support for the "cycle of popularity" observed by Eder. Implications are discussed, including the personal impact of risk behaviors on perceived popular teens, as well as the broader influence their behavior may have on their less popular counterparts.

This paper examines the "sciences" practiced by G. Stanley Hall in his Adolescence of 1904 and by contemporary researchers who study youth in 2004. After briefly reviewing the nature of Hall's empiricism, we draw on a representative sample of articles (n=182) published between 1999 and 2004 in specialty journals to analyze the interdisciplinary science of adolescence today. Results reveal that Hall was largely concerned with the conceptual and empirical description of phenomena, and he seldom offered causal explanations. In contrast, contemporary research frequently neglects description and emphasizes causal modeling. While a shift in focus from description to causation may seem a natural progression, we conclude by arguing that description is necessary even for a "mature" science. The study of adolescence needs a new regime of scientific practice that fully appreciates the value of both description and causal modeling.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2005	15	4					383	394		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2005.00103.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2005.00103.x													WOS:000233518500004

Multiple regression analyses indicated that the increase in reported levels of general friendship support from Time 1 to Time 2 (a 1-year period) was greater for those who reported more positive perceptions of school climate at Time 1. The increase in general friendship support from Time 1 to Time 2 was also greater for those who reported lower support scores from mothers at Time 1. Findings suggest a compensatory model of relationships and draw attention to the importance of exploring the ecological context of adolescent friendships.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2001	11	4					325	349																WOS:000172811100001

Adolescents and young adults judged that it is important to help, satisfying to help, and wrong not to help, particularly when the recipients are in close relationships. With increasing age, helping behavior was viewed less as an obligation and more as a matter of personal choice with distant relationships. Female participants judged it more important to help, overall, than did male participants, but there were no gender differences for how satisfying it would be to help or whether it would be wrong not to help.

Eleven- to 16-year-old adolescents and their mothers were videotaped while engaging in conversations about everyday topics, dating and sexuality, and conflicts. Nonverbal displays of affiliation, embarrassment, and contempt were found to be fairly stable across conversations, across members of the same dyad, and across time for the mothers. However, there were some effects of conversational topic in that adolescents displayed less affiliation in the conflict conversation than in the other conversations during the 1st session. In addition, boys displayed more contempt when talking about dating and sexuality than about conflicts. Over the 2-year period, the level of affiliation decreased for adolescents, and maternal conversational dominance increased. In all conversations and at both time periods, adolescents displayed more embarrassment and contempt and less affiliation than did mothers. Both maternal and adolescent levels of affiliation during the conversations in the Ist session predicted degree of satisfaction with certain family characteristics expressed in the 2nd session.																			1050-8392						1997	7	2					221	239		10.1207/s15327795jra0702_6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0702_6													WOS:A1997WQ17300006

Little is known about developmental change in these activities and definitions among youth, especially in rural America, although they represent social capital far human development. Using multiple dimensions of religious development (church attendance, involvement in church activities, felt religiosity, religious identity), this panel study (7th-10th grades) investigated their developmental pathways over a 4-year period, giving particular attention to changing influences among farm and nonfarm rural youth. Data come from 365 White, two-parent families in the Iowa Youth and Families Project. Adolescents who have grown up on a farm have stronger ties to religious institutions than nonfarm youth, and they express stronger commitments to religious values. The correlates of religious change and continuity indicate that social identities and qualities of the parent-child relationship are important influences.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					1997	7	4					431	456		10.1207/s15327795jra0704_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0704_5													WOS:A1997YA02100005

Strategies to promote safety for sexual and gender minority youth in secondary schools: A longitudinal analysis	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												In order to promote school safety for sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY), many schools implement strategies such as SGM-focused policies and gender-sexuality alliances (GSAs). Little is known about the effects such strategies have over time on feelings of safety at school for SGMY. Hierarchical Linear Models were conducted using longitudinal data from 417 SGMY attending secondary schools to examine trajectories of feelings of safety and the effects of SGM-focused policies, GSA presence, or GSA membership on feelings of safety. Findings indicate that SGM-focused policies and GSAs had direct benefits for safety at school SGMY, both independently and in combination; however, GSA membership was not. Schools should implement a combination of school strategies to promote safer environments for SGMY.					Russell, Stephen/JTT-7077-2023; Ioverno, Salvatore/X-5284-2018	Sherwood, S.

Alabama (2012), the Supreme Court abolished mandatory juvenile life without parole (JLWOP) sentences and subsequently decided that the ruling applied retroactively (Montgomery v. Louisiana, 2016), effectively rendering thousands of inmates eligible for resentencing and potential release from prison. In its decisions, the Court cited developmental science, noting that youth, by virtue of their transient immaturity, are less culpable and more amenable to rehabilitation relative to their adult counterparts. Specifically, the Court notes adolescents' propensity for impulsive action, sensitivity to social influence, and difficulty understanding long-term consequences. Even so, these rulings raised concerns regarding the consequences of releasing prisoners who had committed heinous crimes as juveniles. Several years after the Court's decision, preliminary data are now available to shed light on rates of recidivism among those released. The current paper comprises three goals. First, we discuss the science of adolescent development and how it intersects with legal practice, contextualizing the Court's decision. Second, we present recidivism data from a sample of individuals formerly sentenced to JLWOP in Pennsylvania who were resentenced and released under Miller and Montgomery (N = 287). Results indicate that 15 individuals received new criminal charges up to 7 years postrelease (5.2%), the majority of which were nonviolent offenses. This low rate of recidivism is consistent with the developmental science documenting compromised decision-making during the adolescent years, followed by desistance from criminal behavior in adulthood. Lastly, we discuss the importance of interdisciplinary collaborations between researchers and legal practitioners, as well as critical future avenues of research in this area.

In honor of his many contributions, this paper applies his ideas of developmental continuity and discontinuity to understand the process by which PROSPER delivered universal prevention programs (delivered in Grades 6 and 7) affect young adult outcomes. Guided by these developmental models, we deconstructed adolescent substance use initiation trajectories into two discrete phases-early and late adolescence, demarcated by substance use initiation levels at the end of 9th grade. We evaluated the effects of PROSPER interventions on these phases, and in turn, the effects of adolescent substance use initiation on young adult antisocial behavior, alcohol and drug use consequences, and depression symptoms. This sample included 1,984 young adults who participated in the PROSPER intervention trial in Grade 6 (two cohorts, 2002 and 2003), followed over 8 adolescent measurement occasions (Fall and Spring of Grade 6; Spring of Grades 7-12). Young adult outcomes were averaged across three waves (collected at ages 20, 23, and 25). PROSPER interventions were associated with reduced substance use initiation in early adolescence, but not escalation during late adolescence. In turn, substance use in both early and late adolescence was uniquely associated with young adult antisocial behavior, depression symptoms, and substance use consequences. PROSPER interventions were associated with young adult antisocial behavior and problematic substance use via reduced risk for early initiation status. Findings are discussed in terms of developmental continuity and discontinuity.

The results from 496 Vietnamese high school students show that students' acceptance of school violence and their experience of being the victim of school violence have a significant, and direct, positive effect on their violent behaviors at school. In the moderation model, when students' perception of school climate is more positive, the effect of their acceptance of violence on their violent behaviors at school reduces, implying the moderating effect of school climate. The results have practical implications for educators and policy makers to intervene school violence in Vietnam.

To expand on prior research on mostly white samples, we surveyed first-year students of color from our predominately white university (Southeastern US) to identify risk factors for mental health symptoms and potentially co-occurring problematic alcohol use. Results showed significant associations between microaggressions and poor campus climate (hypothetical predictors) with depressive, anxiety, somatic symptoms (hypothetical outcomes) that were indirectly linked through perceived stress, poor sleep, and academic burnout (hypothetical mediators). Poor campus climate, academic burnout, and using alcohol to cope were the most relevant to alcohol use disorder symptoms.

We address this limitation using a mixed-methods approach. We elicited free responses from contemporary college students (N = 74, M-age = 20.1 years) describing a time they took a risk. Qualitative analysis informed the construction of a self-report positive risk-taking scale, which was administered to a population-based sample of adolescents (N = 1,249, M-age = 16 years) for quantitative validation and examination of associations with normative and impulsive personality. Sensation seeking predicted negative and positive risk-taking, whereas extraversion and openness were predominantly related to positive risk-taking. Results provide promising evidence for a valid measure of adolescents' engagement in positive risks.

Personalized Neural Networks Underlie Individual Differences in Ethnic Identity Exploration and Resolution	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined how ethnic identity relates to large-scale brain networks implicated in social interactions, social cognition, self-definition, and cognitive control. Group Iterative Multiple Model Estimation (GIMME) was used to create sparse, person-specific networks among the default mode and frontoparietal resting-state networks in a diverse sample of 104 youths aged 17-21. Links between neural density (i.e., number of connections within and between these networks) and ethnic identity exploration and resolution were evaluated in the full sample. Ethnic identity resolution was positively related to frontoparietal network density, suggesting that having clarity about one's ethnic group membership is associated with brain network organization reflecting cognitive control. These findings help fill a critical knowledge gap about the neural underpinnings of ethnic identity.

One hundred and twenty-six adolescents (M = 11.88 years; SD = 1.02) residing in the Southeastern United States comprised the study sample. Results indicated that school discrimination was associated with greater depressive symptoms, lower academic persistence, and lower school satisfaction (at 1-year follow-up). In a counterintuitive pattern, adolescents' perceptions of disciplinary inequities were associated with greater persistence. This investigation provided partial support for gender variation. Perceptions of school disciplinary inequities were associated with lower educational aspirations for girls, whereas systemic school discrimination was more strongly associated with boys' educational aspirations. Overall, our study suggests that school-specific systemic discrimination and disciplinary practices shape Black adolescents' adjustment.

Latent transition analysis revealed that after 1 year, transitions congruent with peer influence (whereby non-drinking adolescents initiated alcohol use in the presence of drinking peers) and reverse peer influence were observed in both states; however, transitions congruent with peer selection (whereby drinking adolescents self-selected into drinking peer groups) were only observed among Victorian early adolescents. Findings were interpreted to suggest that Australian family and cultural norms that more commonly allow early adolescent alcohol use lead to a higher rate of peer selection.

Measurement of Dating Aggression During Middle School: Structure, Measurement Invariance, and Distinction From General Aggression	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Two studies examined the factor structure of a modified version of the Safe Dates dating aggression scale and evaluated whether dating aggression is distinct from general aggression during early adolescence. Analyses were conducted on a derivation sample of 3,894 adolescents from 37 schools (Study 1) and an independent cross-validation sample of 938 middle school youth (Study 2). Categorical confirmatory factor analyses supported a two-factor model (perpetration and victimization) over models differentiating psychological and physical forms of aggression. The model was invariant across time, sex, grade, and season. Study 2 also supported dating aggression as distinct from general aggression. Results supported measuring dating aggression perpetration and victimization as latent constructs represented by ordered categorical indicators that capture item severity and frequency.

Influences on Boys' Marijuana Use in High School: A Two-Part Random Intercept Growth Model	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined differences in predictors of marijuana use versus quantity of marijuana use across the high school years, using annual assessments from the Oregon Youth Study (OYS) and a two-part model for semicontinuous data. The OYS is a community sample of at-risk boys followed from age 10years. To capture dynamic prediction effects, change scores of predictors, as well as baseline scores, were included. Baseline predictors predominantly showed associations with the intercepts but not with the slopes of growth models. Change scores for parental monitoring, peer substance use, and antisocial behavior and deviant associations were associated with both parts of the model. Findings highlight the importance of looking at marijuana use compared with the quantity of marijuana use.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				MAR	2014	24	1			SI		117	130		10.1111/jora.12030	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12030								24976739					WOS:000331528500009

The research is not cross-cultural; by contrast, it situates youth engagement contextually, using local perspectives, especially perspectives of adolescents themselves, on growing up well under adverse circumstances, to interrogate conceptions of resilience in cultural context. Participants are viewed as members of cultural communities: observations with a small number of individuals are not generalized to national groups. Rather, knowledge gained by these methods is employed to enrich knowledge of the processes of majority-world youth thriving despite such adversities as poverty and social displacement.

We draw on cross-sectional survey data from 4033 1222-year-olds (50.3% males) from two Kenyan urban slums and subsequent in-depth interviews conducted with a subset of 75 youth when they were 1324years old (45.3% males). We observe that despite the challenges characteristic of urban slums, some youth maintain high aspirations and try to achieve them through education, delinquency, residential mobility, and religion. We note that others adjust their aspirations to account for limited opportunities. Overall, our findings highlight positive youth agency and underscore the need to improve the quality of life in urban slums.

JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Community studies indicating that affluence has social-emotional consequences for youth have conflated family and neighborhood wealth. We examined adolescent boys' delinquency and adolescent girls' anxiety-depression as a function of family, neighborhood, and cumulative affluence in a sample that is primarily of EuropeanAmerican descent, but geographically and economically diverse (N=1,364). Boys in affluent neighborhoods reported higher levels of delinquency and girls in affluent neighborhoods reported higher levels of anxiety-depression compared with youth in middle-class neighborhoods. Neither family affluence nor cumulative affluence, however, placed boys or girls at risk in these domains. Indeed, boys' delinquency and girls' anxiety-depression levels were lowest for those in affluent families living in middle-class neighborhoods.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2013	23	2			SI		274	282		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2012.00829.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2012.00829.x													WOS:000319332400007

Dyads discussed positive and negative topics and then separately reviewed a videotape of the interaction and rated their own and the other person's affect at one-minute intervals. We used multilevel modeling to analyze the association between one's rating of the other person's affect and the other person's affect (empathic sensitivity), and the association between one's rating of the other person's affect and one's own affect (perceived concordance). Adolescents empathic responsiveness was predicted by attachment style, vagal tone, and interactions between them.

We interviewed 89 Jewish and 180 Arab American high school students about their exposure to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, their social cognitive reactions to it, and their stereotypes toward ethnic groups. Beyond the effects of ethnic identity, the degree to which adolescents identified with Israelis and Palestinians in the media was a key variable linking exposure to media depictions of the conflict and the implicit ethnic stereotypes they displayed about Jewish Americans and Arab Americans.

Data were obtained from three annual longitudinal surveys of youth aged 10 - 17 at the first administration (N = 932 at Wave 3). Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that 4 correlated factors corresponding to Social Risk, Social Benefit, Health Risk, and Pleasure adequately represented the expectancy items. High alpha coefficients and stability across survey waves indicated good internal and test - retest reliability for these factors. Latent variable autoregressive analyses indicated that Social Risk expectancies predicted changes in sexual behavior over the course of the study. Multigroup analyses established that the measurement and predictive models were equivalent for males and females and across age groups. The ASEXS provides researchers with a useful measure for examining adolescents' expectancy beliefs about the consequences of sexual behavior.

Findings show that network size decreases over time. Homeless youth with a conduct disorder begin street life with small networks that remain small over time. Caregiver abuse is associated with smaller emotional networks due to fewer home ties, especially to parents, and a more rapid loss of emotional home ties over time. Homeless youth with major depression start out with small networks, but are more likely to maintain network ties. Youth with substance abuse problems are more likely to maintain instrumental home ties. Finally, homeless adolescents tend to reconnect with their parents for instrumental aid and form romantic relationship that provide emotional support.

J	Saewyc, EM				Saewyc, Elizabeth M.			Research on Adolescent Sexual Orientation: Development, Health Disparities, Stigma, and Resilience	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The decade between 1998 and 2008 saw rapid increases in research on adolescent sexual orientation development and related health issues, both in the quantity and in the quality of studies. While much of the research originated in North America, studies from other countries also contributed to emerging understanding of developmental trajectories and social influences on the health of sexual minority adolescents. This paper reviews the body of research from the past decade on adolescent sexual orientation, focused on issues of measurement, developmental trajectories, evidence related to health disparities, and the risks and protective factors that help explain the health and developmental challenges some lesbian, gay, and bisexual adolescents experience. Although many sexual minority adolescents face stigma and rejection within their families, their schools, or their communities, it should be noted that most successfully navigate the developmental tasks of adolescence and attain similar levels of health and well-being as their heterosexual peers, often despite the stigma and discrimination they encounter. Further research is needed to understand population trends as well as individual patterns of development, cultural variations in both development and health disparities, the interplay of general and unique risk factors that contribute to various health disparities and protective factors that buffer those risks, and interventions to promote the healthy development of sexual minority adolescents.

Data were collected at birth through middle adolescence. Data on number of sexual partners and contraception use at age 16 defined sexual abstinence (SAs, n=73), high-risk sexual behavior (HRTs, n=45) and low-risk sexual behavior (LRTs, n=49) groups. Moffitt's (1993) antisocial behavior taxonomy, problem behavior theory (Jessor & Jessor, 1977), social control theory (Hierschi), and a biosocial model (dry, 1988) guided expectations of differential group prediction. Variables from each of three developmental periods (< age 12, ages 12-13, age 16) were significantly associated with sexual behavior groups. The most salient factors that differentiated LRTs from SAs were physical maturation at age 13 and romantic relationship progression and alcohol use at age 16. Romantic relationship progression and drug use at age 16 differentiated HRTs from SAs.

The sample was a panel of 5,104 sixth, seventh, and eighth graders in three public school systems surveyed every 6 months for five assessments. Hierarchical generalized linear models showed that adolescents less embedded in the network, with greater status, and with closer social proximity to peer substance users were more likely to use substances. Also, adolescents in less dense networks and networks with higher smoking prevalence were more likely to smoke and use marijuana. Results establish the utility of social network analysis for measuring peer context and indicate that conventionality of relationships-having friends in the network, being liked but not too well liked, and having fewer friends who use substances-is most beneficial.

In a sample of middle adolescents and their parents (N=677), it was found that parents' AAD scores and maladaptive perfectionism were positively related to psychological control, whereas parents' CSBR scores were negatively related to psychological control. Further, psychological control served as an intervening variable in the links between parent characteristics and adolescent well-being. These findings suggest that two qualitatively different types of psychological control may exist: one originating from parents' separation anxiety and another originating from parents' maladaptive perfectionist standards.

Using a sample of 369 two-parent families with 2 children (a target adolescent in the 8th grade and a sibling aged 10 to 18), we investigated whether the sibling's negative attributions regarding the target adolescent were associated with mother's and father's negative attributions regarding the target adolescent, or the gender constellation and birth order of the sibling pair. In addition, we used the self-reported negative attributions of both siblings and adolescents to investigate whether attributions predicted one's own behavior, or whether the behavior of the partner predicted the perceiver's negative attributions. Structural equation models showed that mothers' and fathers' negative attributions regarding the target adolescent predicted concurrent negative attributions for girls, but not boys. In addition, siblings' negative attributions regarding each other predicted their negative and positive behavior toward the partner 2 years later. The positive behavior of the attribution target also predicted the perceiver's negative attributions, but its effect was weaker. Girl sibling pairs were less negative in their attributions than cross-sex sibling pairs and boy sibling pairs. Finally, although younger siblings were less negative in their attributions than older siblings, this difference decreased over time. This study advances the knowledge of negative attributions in close relationships by identifying family correlates of an understudied, but important, close relationship.

J	Wichstrom, L				Wichstrom, L			The impact of pubertal timing on adolescents' alcohol use	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The relation between pubertal timing and alcohol use was investigated in a nationally representative sample (N = 4,686) of junior high school students who were followed up 2 years later (N = 3,862). Information regarding pubertal timing and status, sex-role identification, number of alcohol intoxications, substance use, sexual behavior, friends' alcohol use, and involvement in other types of problem behaviors was obtained. The results showed that early timing of pubertal development correlated with number of alcohol intoxications and number of units consumed on each occasion, and, to a lesser degree, with the frequency of alcohol use. Moreover, correlations were stronger among males than among females. Substantial parts of the association between pubertal timing and alcohol intoxications were mediated through friends' problem behavior. Pubertal timing predicted alcohol use at follow-up, but the effect was mostly due to increased alcohol intoxications at initial testing.

To this end, we investigated two components of pubertal maturation (i.e., onset of menarche and perceptions of pubertal timing) in a multiethnic, multisocioeconomic sample of urban adolescent girls (N = 866). There were 314 African American, 404 Latins, and 148 White adolescents across low, middle, and high socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds who completed self-report measures of these indicators of pubertal maturation. Adolescents' age at interview ranged from 8.1 to 16.44 years old (M = 12.08, SD = 2.38 years old). Primary caregivers reported information about each family's socioeconomic factors (e.g., primary caretaker's educational attainment, annual household income, and occupational prestige). At the time of the first assessment, 41% of the sample was menarcheal. The range of ages for onset of menarche was consistent across racial/ethnic groups. Results indicated that Latina girls reached menarche significantly earlier than did their White counterparts. However, after controlling for socioeconomic indicators, the significant age difference in menarcheal onset between Latina and White girls disappeared. This finding highlights the importance of including socioeconomic factors in explorations of menarcheal differences across race/ethnicity. Latinas reached menarche earlier than African Americans, and this difference across racial/ethnic groups persisted even after controlling for SES indicators.

Via longitudinal path models, we also separately tested the possibility of bidirectional effects between parental relationships and dieting and parental relationships and body image. Early adolescent girls (N = 127) who were predominantly of normal weight, were seen for 2 consecutive years (M = 12.19 and M = 13.15 years), completed measures assessing their dieting, body image, and relationships with their parents, and had their weights and heights measured. Mothers rated their daughters' pubertal growth by indicating their daughters' level of breast development using the Tanner rating system. Results indicate that girls' perceptions of their relationships with their parents were associated with their dieting attitudes and behaviors, and body image at Time 1 and Time 2. Body mass (kg/m(2)) was only associated in the concurrent regression models. Potential bidirectional effects between parental relationships and dieting or body image revealed significant longitudinal direct effects from parental relationships to dieting and to body image. Findings indicate that for this sample of White, middle-class, young adolescent girls, it appears that negative parent-adolescent relationships are linked to higher diet scores over the 1-year period; however, higher dieting scores are not linked to deteriorating family relationships over time.

Separate models were built for peer rejection and peer acceptance. In 10th grade, 56 boys were virgins and 21 were sexually experienced, the majority with multiple partners. As predicted, peer rejection in sixth grade was associated with number of sexual partners 4 years later via self-restraint and misconduct. Specifically, peers low in self-restraint were rejected by classmates. As adolescents, low-restraint boys were more involved in misconduct, which in turn was associated with number of sexual-partners. Peer acceptance was also associated with number of sexual partners, although via a different path. Boys popular in elementary school were more likely to date extensively during adolescence and to drink alcohol at parties and other gatherings. Dating and alcohol afforded greater opportunities for sexual intercourse with multiple partners.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					1995	5	4					387	411		10.1207/s15327795jra0504_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0504_1													WOS:A1995RV13500001

A sample of 55 young adolescents, their mothers, and their fathers provided self-reports on a scale of affect over a week, following the procedures of the Experience Sampling Method. Analyses showed modest associations between adolescents and parents both in (a) their global emotional patterns (adolescents' and parents' means and variances in affect were correlated); and (b) their immediate emotions (when together, their momentary affect was correlated). These associations varied by the age and gender of the adolescent and the gender of the parent. Time sequence analyses suggested that the similarity in affect between parents and adolescents was partly attributable to transmission of emotions, particularly from daughters to parents and from fathers to sons.																			1050-8392						1994	4	4					567	583		10.1207/s15327795jra0404_8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0404_8													WOS:A1994QL36700008

Across two datasets linking individual-level survey data (N = 1692) and administrative records (N = 300,063; Mage = 12.4, 52% female, 48% male), schools' stated support for diversity (via a pro-diversity mission statement) was related to adolescent mental health and academic achievement, but in nuanced ways depending on individual racial/ethnic backgrounds, the racial/ethnic diversity of the student body and teachers, and the extent of racial disparities in discipline and gifted education. Findings suggest that communicating support for diversity without redressing systemic inequities in school discipline and academic tracking will not reduce racism-related achievement gaps and may instead exacerbate mental health disparities.

Short-term impact of a combination intervention on family cohesion: Results from a pilot cluster-randomized clinical trial in Northern Ghana	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Child labor remains a concern in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, evidence-based preventive efforts are limited. We analyzed longitudinal data from Ghanaian adolescent girls in a pilot randomized clinical trial testing the preliminary impact of a combination intervention on family cohesion as a protective factor against child labor and school dropout. While there was no statistical difference between the control and intervention groups at 9 months, the results show that family cohesion scores improved significantly from baseline to 9 months for the ANZANSI intervention group. Qualitative results indicated improved family cohesion in the intervention group. Hence, future studies should further examine this promising social work intervention.

Complicating critical discussions in gender sexuality alliances: Youth desire for intersectional conversations and the experience of fragmentation	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Gender sexuality alliances (GSAs) represent consciousness-raisings that hold potential for critical consciousness development in youth. In this study, we focus on critical reflection-the understanding that oppression is structured and maintained by human action. We engage intersectionality as our analytical framework and analyze both student interview data (n = 38) and advisor closed-ended and open-ended survey data (n = 58) to examine: (1) the nature/content of critically reflective discussions in GSAs and (2) how advisors support critically reflective discussions in GSAs and their role in these discussions. Our findings suggest that (1) conversations centering race and its intersections with other socio-structural axes occur, albeit infrequently; (2) youth recognize and understand the concept of intersectionality in nuanced ways, desire to have critical intersectional conversations, and experience fragmentation from conversations around race, sexuality, and gender if they are situated at privileged locations on those axes; and (3) students want advisors to engage in critically reflective discussions in GSAs. The findings suggest that interventions and programming are needed that could cultivate advisors' and youth leaders' skills in facilitating intersectional dialogues for critical reflection among members.

Empirical examination of measurement models for PWB in adolescence is lacking. Thus, the current study examined PWB in a longitudinal, diverse sample of 433 adolescents (non-Latinx Black: 37.6%; non-Latinx White: 25.9%; Latinx: 36.5%; Male adolescents: 50.1%). A one-factor, correlated six-factor and hierarchical models were examined across racial/ethnic (White, Black, and Hispanic) and gender (female, male) identities, after which the best fitting model was selected to undergo invariance testing. A one-factor structure was superior, and exhibited strict invariance across racial/ethnic and gender identities at each wave of the study, as well as longitudinal invariance within the entire sample.

Psychometric Evaluation of the Affect Regulation Checklist: Clinical and Community Samples, Parent-Reports and Youth Self-Reports	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The Affect Regulation Checklist (ARC) was designed to capture affect dysregulation, suppression, and reflection. Importantly, affect dysregulation has been established as a transdiagnostic mechanism underpinning many forms of psychopathology. We tested the ARC psychometric properties across clinical and community samples and through both parent-report and youth self-report information. Clinical sample: Participants included parents (n = 814; M-age = 43.86) and their child (n = 608; M-age = 13.98). Community sample: Participants included independent samples of parents (n = 578; M-age = 45.12) and youth (n = 809; M-age = 15.67). Exploratory structural equation modeling supported a three-factor structure across samples and informants. Dysregulation was positively associated with all forms of psychopathology. In general, suppression was positively associated with many forms of psychopathology, and reflection was negatively associated with externalizing problems and positively associated with internalizing problems.

Thirty-five interviews conducted in 2020 with high-school-aged students in Chicago were analyzed to better understand young people's experiences developing an understanding of anti-Asian racism and anti-Blackness. Results indicated that participants overwhelmingly engaged in sustained conversations about Black Lives Matter and/or made efforts to address anti-Blackness within their families, but engaged in limited conversations about anti-Asian racism. Furthermore, conversations at home and school often failed to contextualize anti-Asian racism, specifically in relation to the experiences of other oppressed groups. Findings highlight a need for research on and practice with Chinese American adolescents to recognize the unique racial positioning of Asian Americans under White supremacy.

Peer Adversity Predicts Interpersonal Needs in Adolescent Girls	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The need to belong (NTB) and need for approval (NFA) are fundamental interpersonal needs vital to social development. Although these needs are universal, individual differences in the strength of these needs likely emerge from critical social experiences. In particular, given the growing salience of peer social evaluation and belonging across adolescence, interpersonal needs during this stage may be strongly tied to both early and recent experiences in the peer group. The aim of the present study was to examine the contribution of lifetime and recent peer adversity to both general and situation-specific interpersonal needs in a sample of adolescent girls (N = 89, M-age = 15.85). Results revealed that recent peer adversity predicted avoidance-oriented NFA, whereas a significant interaction between lifetime and recent peer adversity predicted approach-oriented NFA. Although neither lifetime nor recent peer adversity predicted individual differences in NTB, both predicted threats to interpersonal needs in the context of a laboratory manipulation of social exclusion. Specifically, both lifetime and recent peer adversity predicted greater need-threat prior to the exclusion, but only individuals who had experienced lifetime peer adversity continued to display ongoing high levels of threatened interpersonal needs.

Results revealed recency effects of grade 9 looks on popularity/likability and dating/sexual behaviors and a lingering amplification effect of grade 3 looks on popularity/likability at the start of high school.

A Meta-Analysis of Friendship Qualities and Romantic Relationship Outcomes in Adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Romantic relationships are one of the most significant interpersonal ties in adolescence, thus understanding factors that may contribute to their formation and quality are important. The current meta-analysis focuses on links between friendship quality and romantic relationship outcomes for adolescents up to 18 years. In a series of meta-analyses (k = 28 studies, N's = 946-4,040), friendship qualities were not related to romantic involvement. However, we did find robust evidence of continuity between friendship qualities and romantic relationship qualities. Additionally, adolescents experienced more negative quality in their romantic relationships than in their friendships. These findings suggest that friendships have implications for adolescents' romantic relationships, although more research is needed on specific quality associations, and the mediators of these relations.

The Development of Self-Compassion, Empathy, and Prosocial Behavior in Adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Both self-compassion and empathy have been theorized to promote prosociality in youth, but there is little longitudinal data examining this possibility. We assessed self-compassion, empathy, and peer-rated prosociality yearly, in a cohort of 2,078 youth across 17 schools (M age at T1 = 14.65 years; 49.2% female), as they progressed from Grade 9-12. We utilized multi-level modeling to predict prosocial behavior, nested within students, classes, and schools. We found that self-compassion and empathy uniquely predicted peer-rated prosocial behavior. However, only empathy predicted increases in prosocial behavior across time. While self-compassion is not selfish, it does not appear to facilitate the development of kindness toward adolescent peers. Self-compassion may help to buffer against possible negative effects of empathic distress.

J	James, A; Ward, RM				James, Anthony; Ward, Rose Marie			Temporal Relation Between Youths' Perceived Spirituality and Indicators of Positive Development	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Using data from the 4-H Study of Positive Youth Development (PYD), we employed a cross-lagged model to examine the temporal order of the relationship between PYD and youths' spirituality. Our sample consisted of 1,842 youth from 32 states in the continental United States. Mean age across the two waves of data used in this study was 15.5 and 16.6, respectively. The cross-lagged model allowed us to test the model suggesting that youth must develop certain abilities (e.g., Cs of PYD) prior to constructing and internalizing abstract notions of spirituality. Findings supported this argument, with relations varying across conceptions of spirituality. This study provides a more comprehensive understanding of mechanisms and processes linking youths' spirituality and PYD, highlighting several important implications for research and practice.

An Integrative Model of Social, Motivational, and Emotional Approaches in Adolescents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Loneliness has been linked to many physical and mental health problems, especially during adolescence. From evolutionary, social needs, and cognitive approaches, this study examined whether emotional repair, relatedness need, and peer-rated indicators of relations behave in predicting loneliness, considering all approaches together. The sample consisted of 373 adolescents measured longitudinally at three time points. Results of a cross-lagged panel design found that, considering all the influences together, relatedness need showed the highest strength to predict loneliness. Furthermore, adolescents who were accepted by their peers and whose relatedness need was satisfied activated emotional regulation which additionally produced a decrease in prospective feelings of loneliness. In addition, loneliness has been shown to be a consequence of these variables.

The teaching of emotional skills has an important impact on reducing aggression in schools. However, little scientific evidence has shown the explanatory mechanism through which this training reduces aggression during adolescence. This article aims to provide evidence for the effectiveness of a 3-year longitudinal intervention among adolescents in nine Spanish schools. A total of 476 adolescents participated. Results showed a reduction in physical and verbal aggression in Time 2 through the reduction in negative affect, anger, and hostile feelings, compared with an active control group. The training seems to be crucial for dealing with the emotional and cognitive components of aggression and, thus, their behavioral manifestations.

We revealed that magazine exposure positively correlated with the internalization of appearance ideals and the attribution of social rewards to attractiveness which, in turn, related to social appearance anxiety. Internalization and attribution of social rewards formed a reinforcing spiral; once internalized, early adolescents associate positive things with appearance ideals (e.g., peer acceptance) and the perception of rewards increases early adolescents' inclination to internalize ideals. Given the adverse consequences of social appearance anxiety, the findings warrant research on the role of media in the occurrence of social appearance anxiety.

The population-based TOPP study (N=459) was used to investigate (1) child-rearing conflict trajectories through four time points during childhood and adolescence (ages 8-16), and (2) associations between conflict trajectories and child characteristics (i.e., birth order, gender, externalizing patterns from early childhood). Latent profile analysis identified six distinct trajectories. Conflict levels decreased for most respondents over the adolescent offspring period, but offspring's birth order and externalizing problems were related to less typical trajectories and higher levels of conflict. Onset of externalizing problems was of additional importance for the course of parental child-rearing conflicts. The results highlight the perception of the whole family as an interwoven system.

Sympathy was examined as a possible mediator. Three hundred and eight randomly selected families completed Waves 3, 4, and 5 of the Flourishing Families Project. Multiple group comparison via structural equation modeling compared differences between girls and boys. Sibling affection (T3) was positively associated with adolescents' sympathy (T4) and prosocial behavior (T5). Sibling hostility (T3) was positively associated with adolescents' depression (T5) and externalizing behavior (T5) (for boys only), even after controlling for parent and friend relationships.

Consequently, such research has often emphasized the negative influences of peers. This study, however, operationalizes peer influence through best-friend communication against substance use and examines whether it indirectly protects against substance use by promoting anti-substance use norms. Structural equation modeling was utilized with longitudinal survey data from 277 Latino and 350 non-Latino white 6th-8th-grade-students. For Latino and non-Latino white students, best-friend communication was indirectly related to alcohol and cigarette use through norms. Best-friend communication also was indirectly related to marijuana use, but only for non-Latino white students and for male students.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				SEP	2015	25	3					534	550		10.1111/jora.12147	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12147													WOS:000358083000010

The purpose of this study was to investigate, among a sample of adolescents in foster care, whether the degree of caregiver-adolescent disagreement on adolescents' internalizing problems would be associated with adolescent externalizing problem behaviors over time. Two measures of adolescent caregiver agreement, the Pearson's r and intraclass correlations, were used with data drawn from a nationally representative study of children on foster care. Growth curve analyses of 180 adolescents revealed that the higher adolescent and caregiver agreement on adolescents' internalizing problems at Wave I, the slower the increase in externalizing problems over time.					cui, ming/L-6608-2019; McWey, Lenore/JZC-9078-2024	Cui, Ming/0000-0002-3669-3473; McWey, Lenore/0000-0003-0642-7841													1050-8392	1532-7795				MAR	2015	25	1					44	50		10.1111/jora.12105	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12105													WOS:000350125300006

We propose that the presence of peers increases the salience of the immediate rewards of a risky choice. The current study examined the effect of peer presence on reward sensitivity in a sample of 100 late adolescents ages 18 through 20 (M = 18.5) using a delay discounting task, which assesses an individual's preference for immediate versus delayed rewards. Participants were randomly assigned to complete the task alone or with 2 same-age, same-sex peers observing. Consistent with our prediction, adolescents demonstrated a greater preference for immediate rewards when with their peers than when alone. Heightened risk taking by adolescents in the company of their friends may be due in part to the effect that being with one's peers has on reward sensitivity.

This study uses hierarchical linear modeling to assess the effects of school context on gender differences in depressive symptoms among adolescents based on two waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=9,709 teens, 127 schools). Analysis indicates significant school-level variation in both overall symptom levels and the average gender gap in depression net of prior symptoms and individual-level covariates. Aggregate levels of depressive symptomatology were positively associated with contextual-level socioeconomic status (SES) disadvantage. A cross-level contingency emerged for the relationship between gender and depressive symptoms with school SES and aggregate perceived community safety such that the gender "gap" was most apparent in contexts characterized by low SES disadvantage and high levels of perceived safety. These results highlight the importance of context to understanding the development of mental health disparities.

It was based on 2 longitudinal projects: the JyvAskylA Longitudinal Study of Personality and Social Development (JYLS; N=196 boys and 173 girls) conducted in Finland and the Columbia County Longitudinal Study (CCLS; N=436 boys and 420 girls) conducted in the United States. The same peer-nominated items for aggression were used in both studies at age 8; comparable measures of aggression were also available in adolescence (age 14 in the JYLS/19 in the CCLS) and adulthood (ages 36/30 and 42/48). Results showed that in both countries and in both genders, aggression in school age was linked significantly to physical aggression and lack of self-control of anger in adulthood but not to verbal aggression. This differential predictability of aggression over 40 years suggests that individual differences in physical aggression are more determined by lasting individual differences (including emotional reactivity) than are individual differences in verbal aggression.

Gender- and age-related differences in the association between social relationship quality and trait levels of salivary cortisol	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The majority of studies linking individual differences in the quality of social relationships and activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis have focused on the early development of attachment between infants and their caregivers. Later in development, during middle childhood and adolescence, the parallel HPA links to age-appropriate social relationships with peers, parents, and siblings remain largely unspecified. This study addressed this knowledge gap. Early morning saliva samples were obtained from 367 children in middle childhood (ages 6-10) and 357 adolescents (M age=11-16 years) on two successive days 1 year apart and assayed for cortisol. Latent state-trait modeling was employed to separate variance in cortisol levels attributable to "stable trait-like" versus "state or situational specific" sources to minimize the high moment-to-moment variation in basal adrenocortical activity. During adolescence but not middle childhood, and for girls but not boys, lower levels of "trait cortisol" were associated with poor quality social relationships. The pattern was robust, extending to the quality of relationships with parents, siblings, and peers. Importantly, the relationship was independent of the rates of internalizing or externalizing problem behavior. We found that isolating the variance in cortisol levels attributable to stable intrinsic sources revealed an interpretable pattern that linked individual differences in basal HPA activity to social relationships during adolescence. Studies are needed to reveal the biosocial mechanisms involved in the establishment of this gender- and age-specific phenomenon and to decipher whether or not individual differences in this hormone-behavior link are adaptive.

Beyond simple prevalence estimates, however, little research has been conducted on substance use in the school context. The present investigation was an in-depth study of students' attitudes and behaviors regarding alcohol and marijuana use during the school day. Based on a representative sample of 1123 high school students, this study assessed the frequency of alcohol and marijuana use at school among demographic subgroups, the accessibility of drugs in school, and students' perceived consequences of being caught using drugs in school. The results showed that male and Hispanic students had higher levels of drug use at school than female and white students, respectively; that school drug use increased with age, and that alcohol and marijuana were easily obtained and used on school grounds. A large percentage of students were not aware of the specific actions taken in their schools to punish drug use. The need for additional research on school-related drug use is emphasized.																			1050-8392						2006	16	1					69	77		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2006.00121.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2006.00121.x													WOS:000234855200006

However, few studies examine whether different cultural and ethnic groups share these factors. This study is an attempt to fill a gap in research by examining similarities and differences in risk factors across racial and ethnic groups. The social development model has shown promise in organizing predictors of problem behaviors. This article investigates whether a version of that model can be generalized to youth in different racial and ethnic groups (N=2,055, age range from 11 to 15), including African American (n=478), Asian Pacific Islander (API) American (n=491), multiracial (n=442), and European American (n=644) youth. The results demonstrate that common risk factors can be applied to adolescents, regardless of their race and ethnicity. The findings also demonstrate that there are racial and ethnic differences in the magnitudes of relationships among factors that affect problem behaviors. Further study is warranted to develop a better understanding of these differential magnitudes.

Models with separate growth trajectories for aggression, drug use, and delinquent behavior provided the best fit for both samples and revealed relations between initial levels of aggression and subsequent changes in the other behaviors. Boys and girls differed in their initial levels of these behaviors, but not their patterns of change. Differences in growth curve trajectories were found across samples. These findings have important implications for assessment and prevention of problem behaviors in adolescents.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2005	15	2					179	203		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2005.00091.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2005.00091.x													WOS:000228750800003
J	Smetana, JG; Metzger, A				Smetana, JG; Metzger, A			Family and religious antecedents of civic involvement in middle class African American late adolescents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												We examined family and religious/spiritual antecedents and correlates of current and intended civic involvement in 76 middle class African American late adolescents (M=18.43 years) who had been followed longitudinally for 3 years. Adolescents' spirituality/religiosity and mothers' current involvement influenced the overall ratings and more specifically, current church and community (but not political) involvement, as assessed on a 14-item measure expanded from Youniss et al. (1997). In addition, greater family income, earlier spirituality, and less receptivity to mothers in observed dyadic interactions led to more community involvement in late adolescence. Intended civic involvement was predicted by greater spirituality and mothers' (and in exploratory analyses, fathers') observed positive communication (but not mothers' warmth and prosocial behavior) in dyadic interactions 3 years earlier; the effect of middle adolescents' spirituality on late adolescents' ratings of future civic involvement was fully mediated by adolescents' current spirituality/religiosity.

Same-gender friendships, affiliation with mixed-gender groups, dating, and romantic relationships were investigated in a sample of 1,284 young adolescents of diverse ethnocultural backgrounds. Data were collected cross-sectionally in Grades 5 through 8, as well as longitudinally in the fall and spring of an academic year. Consistent with a stage model, affiliation with mixed-gender groups and dating were qualitatively distinct activities that were sequentially organized and facilitated the progression from same-gender friendships to dyadic romantic relationships. The results also provide insights on how the developmental context may alter stage pathways: Dating activities were incorporated with mixed-gender affiliations, group-based romantic stages showed more stability than other stages, and the ethnocultural context influenced romantic timing. Finally, results indicated that participation in romantic activities heightened adolescents' future interest in having a romantic relationship.																			1050-8392						2004	14	2					185	207		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2004.01402003.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2004.01402003.x													WOS:000221766500003

Growth curve analyses were performed using hierarchical linear modeling to consider psychosocial background, motivation and school attitudes, and parental and peer influences at age 14 as predictors of concurrent substance use and change in substance use. Results indicated that school misbehavior and peer encouragement of misbehavior were positively associated with substance use at age 14 and with increased use over time; school bonding, school interest, school effort, academic achievement, and parental help with school were negatively associated. The protective effects of positive school attitudes and perceptions of high status connected to academics were stronger for low-achieving compared with high-achieving youth. Implications for a developmental perspective on substance use etiology and prevention are discussed.

In a variable-centered approach, factor analyses yielded five dimensions of support: three specific to providers (parent, friend, and sibling support) and two specific to provisions (convergence of goals and respect for autonomy). Only parental support was found to change (decrease) across age. In a person-centered approach, five types of adolescents with different configurations of perceived support were identified. The first three types differed in overall level of support (high, average, and low) for all of the five dimensions; the fourth type represented extremely low support from parents with above-average support from best friends; the fifth type consisted of adolescents with no best friend. These configurations were significantly related to different patterns of adolescent adjustment in various domains (psychological well-being, delinquency, substance use, and peer-group functioning).					scholte, ron/G-2030-2012														1050-8392						2001	11	1					71	94		10.1111/1532-7795.00004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1532-7795.00004													WOS:000168071800004
J	Hamburg, DA; Takanishi, R				Hamburg, DA; Takanishi, R			Great transitions: Preparing American youth for the 21st century - The role of research	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This article summarizes the findings of the Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development's concluding report, Great Transitions: Preparing Adolescents for a New Century (Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development, 1995). Research indicates that adolescents face increasingly poor odds for success in today's rapidly changing societies. The natural inclination to experiment with risky behavior is occurring at an earlier age, and the potential for disability, even death, is thus greater. Great Transitions recommends a generic approach to preventive interventions for adolescents that includes: reengaging families with their adolescents, designing developmentally appropriate schools, promoting the health of adolescents, strengthening communities with youth, and promoting the constructive potential of media. Research opportunities suggested by the report include: biological aspects of adolescence, economic factors in adolescent development, time use studies on families and adolescents, and evaluation of preventive interventions.																			1050-8392						1996	6	4					379	396																WOS:A1996VT15100003

By mid-adolescence (age 13 to 15 years), however, girls show significantly higher rates of depressive disorders and depressive symptoms than boys. I argue that the emergence of gender differences in depression are most likely due to an interaction of two factors: (a) Girls enter early adolescence with a style of responding to frustration and distress that is less efficacious and action-oriented than boys, and (b) girls begin to face certain uncontrollable stressors in early adolescence to a greater extent than boys.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					1994	4	4					519	534		10.1207/s15327795jra0404_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0404_5													WOS:A1994QL36700005

However, little is known about the role of the media in influencing attitudes in adolescence. Combining information environment and ecological development theories, the current study examined the longitudinal associations between the quantity, valence (i.e., neutral, positive, and negative), and target (i.e., migrant, refugee, and foreigner) of the news about ethnic minority groups and youth's affective and cognitive prejudice. In total, 962 adolescents (Mage = 15.67, 48.13% females) completed questionnaires at two time points, and news data were gathered from a national newspaper. While news quantity did not matter, positive and negative news were respectively associated with reduced and increased levels of cognitive, but not affective, prejudice. Nuanced associations emerged when accounting for the news target. Results were replicated regardless of adolescents' direct consumption of newspapers. These findings highlight the role of the information environment and suggest the need to account for it in planning interventions.

Parallel process latent growth modeling on three-wave data from ethnically diverse Swiss adolescents (N = 1365; Mage 13.67 years, 48.6% female), showed baseline-level associations between short-term mindsets and risk behaviors, and between the two risk behaviors. Additionally, correlated change (co-development) existed between short-term mindsets-particularly impulsivity-and delinquency, but not between short-term mindsets and cannabis use. These results support the above-mentioned theories and emphasize the importance of investigating the correlates of change in delinquency and cannabis use separately, as divergent findings might emerge. These divergent findings could partially stem from Switzerland's liberal views on cannabis use.

Links between socioeconomic position and cognitive and behavioral regulation in adolescence: The role of pubertal development	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Adolescent cognitive and behavioral regulation is influenced by multidimensional and multidirectional processes within and across biological and contextual systems that shift throughout development. Key among these influences are distal processes such as early life socioeconomic position (SEP), and proximal processes such as pubertal development, but questions remain concerning how links between SEP, pubertal development, and cognitive and behavioral regulation accumulate and unfold over adolescence. In the current study, and in line with Dr. John Schulenberg's foundational work, direct associations between SEP, puberty, and adolescent cognitive and behavioral regulation were examined; then pubertal timing and tempo were considered as moderators and mediators of links between SEP and adolescent cognitive and behavioral regulation. Data were drawn from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development, a longitudinal study of 970 youth (52% male; 80% White, 13% Black, and 7% another race/ethnicity). Cognitive and behavioral regulation was measured using direct assessments of working memory, planning, risky decision-making, and impulse control at age 15. SEP included maternal education and family income-to-needs and was averaged from birth to 54 months old; estimates of pubertal timing and tempo were derived using logistic growth curve models from age 9 to age 15. SEP was directly associated with cognitive and behavioral regulation. Pubertal development tended to moderate those links, but rarely mediated them. Specifically, socioeconomic disadvantage along with earlier timing or faster tempo tended to be associated with worse cognitive and behavioral regulation. Overall, findings suggest that pubertal timing and tempo may exacerbate existing environmental constraints.

Interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Youth described choosing social interactions carefully, avoiding high-violence areas, and keeping busy with activities. Many youths discussed the necessity of minimizing contact with peers to avoid violence, resulting in isolation from friends and increased engagement with family at home. Adult supports reflected upon an intergenerational transfer of violence avoidance, safety planning, and coping strategies through sharing their own lived experiences. Dyads highlighted the need for intergenerational programming to address social isolation and build supportive social networks.

Participants were 349 first-year university students (39.8% male, M-age = 18.20) and their mothers (M-age = 49.10) in Hong Kong. Latent class growth analysis identified two subgroups based on levels of mothers' threat perceptions (i.e., lower vs. higher). Multi-group random-intercept cross-lagged models found that, at the within-person level, students' reconsideration of educational commitments positively predicted helicopter parenting only for mothers with higher threat perceptions. These findings mainly support youth-driven effects on overbearing parenting behaviors. Mothers' threat perceptions might exacerbate these excessive responses to youth's academic turbulence.

Using a nationally representative sample of 15- to 18-year-old adolescents from the American Time Use Survey (N = 10,341; 47% female; 57% white), structural equation modeling demonstrated that late SOTs mediated links between evening activities, social contact, locations, and shorter sleep durations.

Therefore, the present study examined how the temporal development of perceived autonomy support from their German language arts teachers is related to changes in four different facets of students' well-being. Longitudinal data from 3446 adolescents from Germany (N-Schools = 178) on five measurement points (Grades 5-9) were analyzed using latent growth curve models. Satisfaction with school, enjoyment of school, and self-rated health decreased over time, while social integration remained stable. Perceived teacher autonomy support also declined between Grades 5 and 9. Furthermore, baseline levels of perceived teacher autonomy support and facets of well-being were positively related. Finally and most importantly, our results indicated that changes in perceived teacher autonomy support were positively associated with the development of satisfaction with school, enjoyment of school, and self-rated health, but not social integration. The findings suggest that perceived teacher autonomy support plays an important role in the development of students' well-being in adolescence.

In both cohorts, the largest group reported low substance use and high well-being, with a smaller group exhibiting maladaptive trajectories for both substance use and well-being. Two additional groups were identified during middle adolescence characterized by either low well-being or high substance use. Family connectedness was a protective factor, while high peer connectedness was a risk factor for substance-use groups and low peer connectedness for languishing.

Participants were 93 adolescents (47.31% girls, M-age = 16.04) and their mothers (M-age = 45.83) from middle-class families. Mothers immigrated to Israel from the Former Soviet Union or Western countries (Myears-in-Israel = 19.75). We used a multimethod multi-informant approach that included a novel narrative procedure for assessing acculturative stress and benefit finding. Structural Equation Modeling supported the hypothesis, suggesting that research on and practice with adolescents in immigrant families should consider the meaning parents derive from their immigration experiences.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2021	31	2					351	367		10.1111/jora.12601	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12601		DEC 2020						33377229					WOS:000603301000001

Adolescents' Evaluations of Political Leaders: The Case of President Donald Trump	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The current study explored youths' views of President Donald Trump using quantitative ratings and open-ended responses from a diverse sample of 1,432 U.S. adolescents from three geographic regions. Adolescent demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, race, geographic location) were systematically associated with their views about Trump. Open-ended responses demonstrated substantial variability in youths' rationales for approving or disapproving of the president. Adolescents' attitudes were informed by knowledge of the president's leadership attributes, political views and policies, and their own experiences. Findings indicate that adolescents draw upon and synthesize a broad range of information when formulating their political views and coordinate this knowledge with their own opinions and experiences when evaluating political figures.

The questionnaire-based data were analyzed with growth mixture modeling and four burnout profiles were identified among student-athletes. From the found burnout profiles, two were typical for the interviewed subsample of elite athletes (n = 17), that is, burnout risk and non risk profiles. We generated rich descriptions of well-being and ill-being, showing that elite athletes in two burnout profiles differed in their experienced demands and resources related to individual and environmental factors.

This study examined how personal friendship network characteristics were associated with obesity-related behaviors from late childhood to early adolescence. Two waves of friendship, physical activity, screen time, and dietary recall data were collected from 11- to 13-year-old students (99% retention) in Australia (n = 308) over a five- to eight-month period. Regression models identified friendship network characteristics that predicted later health behaviors which varied by gender and behavior type, such as the number of friends positively associated with physical activity intensity (males) and screen time (females).

Surveys were administered to all 10th- and 11th-grade students at participating high schools at baseline (mean age = 16.10, SD = .71) and 1 year later. Girls reported higher levels of self-competence in close friendships and more depressive symptoms, whereas boys reported higher levels of self-competence in athletics and physical appearance. However, there were no gender differences in the associations between self-competence and depressive symptoms. Results from autoregressive, cross-lagged path analyses indicated that depressive symptoms predicted self-competence more consistently than self-competence predicted depressive symptoms during middle-late adolescence.

A polygenic risk score indexed genetic risk for poor response inhibition. Adolescents' performance on a response inhibition task mediated the relation between adolescents' polygenic risk scores and mother's inconsistent parenting (i.e., evocative rGE), even after controlling for mothers' genetic risk (i.e., passive rGE). Mothers' inconsistent parenting subsequently prospectively predicted adolescents' externalizing problems. Adolescents' response inhibition also prospectively predicted later externalizing behaviors. These findings were subgroup-specific, with greater risk for non-Hispanic Caucasian boys with substance-disordered parents. Results suggest that poor response inhibition may increase risk for adolescents' externalizing problems both directly and by evoking certain environmental conditions.

Participants completed questionnaires at 12th grade, 2 and 4 years after high school. Results indicated that parent support increased across this period for participants from European backgrounds but remained stable for participants from Asian and Latin American backgrounds. Peer and sibling support remained relatively stable. Supports had specific implications for self-esteem and depressive mood. On average, young adults with higher levels of support reported greater expectations to reciprocate support within the family.

The Peer Network Origins of Adolescent Dating	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The proximity of dating partners in peer friendship networks has important implications for the diffusion of health-risk behaviors and adolescent social development. We derive two competing hypotheses for the friendship-romance association. The first predicts that daters are proximally positioned in friendship networks prior to dating and that opposite-gender friends are likely to transition to dating. The second predicts that dating typically crosses group boundaries and opposite-gender friends are unlikely to later date. We test these hypotheses with longitudinal friendship data for 626 ninth-grade PROSPER heterosexual dating couples. Results primarily support the second hypothesis: Romantic partners are unlikely to be friends in the previous year or share the same cohesive subgroup, and opposite-gender friends are unlikely to transition to dating.

Development and Lability in the Parent-Child Relationship During Adolescence: Associations With Pubertal Timing and Tempo	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Adolescents' and parents' reactions to pubertal development are hypothesized to contribute to changes in family dynamics. Using 7-year longitudinal data from the NICHD-SECCYD (488 boys, 475 girls), we examined relations between pubertal development (timing, tempo) and trajectories (developmental change and year-to-year lability) of parent-child conflict and closeness from age 8.5 to 15.5years. Changes were mostly characterized by year-to-year fluctuationslability. Parent-child conflict increased and closeness decreased some with age. Pubertal timing and tempo were more consistently associated with lability in parent-child relationships than with long-term trends, although faster tempo was associated with steeper decreases in parent-child closeness. Findings provide a platform for examining how puberty contributes to both long-term and transient changes in adolescents' relationships and adjustment.

Beginning in the fall of 7th grade, 825 American and Chinese children (mean age=12.73years) reported on their autonomous (vs. controlled) motivation as well as unpleasant and pleasant affect every 6months until the end of eighth grade. In both the United States and China, there were negative reciprocal pathways between children's autonomous motivation and unpleasant affect. Over time, heightened autonomous motivation predicted dampened unpleasant affect, which in turn predicted heightened autonomous motivation. Positive reciprocal pathways between children's autonomous motivation and pleasant affect were evident over time only in China.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				DEC	2014	24	4					646	653		10.1111/jora.12054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12054								25593503					WOS:000344789500009

We found that the increase in delinquency associated with gang membership was concentrated in two combinations: serious violence and drug selling; and serious violence, drug selling, and serious theft. Several covariates were similarly associated with multitype serious delinquency and gang membership (age, historical time, Black race, and residential mobility), suggesting that these behaviors may share common developmental, familial, and contextual risks.

We hypothesized that intraracial friendships would be beneficial for racial or ethnic minority youth because such relationships provide protection and solidarity in a discriminatory society. Results revealed that most youth had only intraracial best friends during middle school, but 38% had at least one interracial best friend. Associations between interracial best friendships and well-being varied by racial group; Black and Asian American youth with only interracial best friends reported lower emotional well-being than those with only intraracial best friends.

Alcohol Use and Popularity: Social Payoffs From Conforming to Peers' Behavior	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Although many economic analyses of adolescents have examined the costs of risky behaviors, few have investigated the gains that young people derive from such actions, particularly in terms of social payoffs for complying with peer behavior. This paper studies the relationship between adolescents' use of alcohol (relative to that of their peers) and popularity at school. We use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a rich and nationally representative survey with detailed information on social networks. Our findings suggest that adolescents are socially rewarded for conforming to their peers' alcohol use and penalized (to a lesser degree) for increasing their consumption above that of their peers. Male adolescents are rewarded for keeping up with their peers' drinking and for getting drunk. Female adolescents are rewarded for drinking per se, but not necessarily for keeping up with their peers. The results offer new information on peer influence and have implications for substance abuse interventions at school and in the community.					; , Edward/B-2211-2009	French, Michael/0000-0002-2812-916X; , Edward/0000-0003-4555-0631													1050-8392						2011	21	3					559	568		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00704.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00704.x								21860582					WOS:000293790200004

Specific models considered the main effects of both previous adolescent delinquency and violence and current opposite sex romantic partners' criminality and violence, as well as the interaction of these with each other and by sex of primary participant. Main effects for adolescent delinquency and partners' criminality were significant; however, the results of the interactions by sex suggest different patterns of results for males and females. Models run separately by sex showed that having a prior delinquent history predicted adult criminality for males but not for females, while being in a relationship with a criminal partner increased the odds of criminal behavior in young adulthood for both males and females. A different pattern of results was found for violence in young adulthood. Having a prior violent history predicted adult violence for males and females. However, being in a relationship with a violent partner increased the odds of violent behavior for females only.																			1050-8392						2011	21	3					608	618		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00693.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00693.x													WOS:000293790200009

We examined the interaction of a stressor (receipt of public assistance) and a gene regulating MAOA in the prediction of change in adolescent depressive symptoms and body mass index (BMI). Participants were drawn from the National Longitudinal Study on Adolescent Health (Add Health) genetically informative subsample. We focused on males due to the fact that males only have one MAOA allele. Growth curve analyses were conducted to assess the associations between public assistance, MAOA allele, and their interaction and the intercept and slope of depressive symptoms and BMI. The results indicated that among males, MAOA allele type interacted with receipt of public assistance in the prediction of rate of change in both depressive symptoms and BMI from early adolescence through early adulthood. Males with the short MAOA allele whose families received public assistance tended to experience increased growth in depressive symptoms and BMI. Implications of the findings for understanding the relations among stress, physiology, and development are discussed.

Mexican American Parents' Involvement in Adolescents' Peer Relationships: Exploring the Role of Culture and Adolescents' Peer Experiences	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined the nature and correlates of Mexican American mothers' and fathers' involvement in adolescents' peer relationships along 4 dimensions: support, restriction, knowledge, and time spent with adolescents and peers. Mexican American adolescents and their parents in 220 families described their family relationships, cultural orientations/values, and experiences with adolescents' peers in home interviews. In addition, time-use data were collected during a series of 7 phone calls to measure parents' time spent with adolescents and peers and parents' knowledge of adolescents' daily experiences with peers. Multilevel models revealed connections between parents' involvement in adolescents' peer relationships and both parents' Mexican and Anglo orientations and familism values and adolescents' peer experiences (e.g., deviant peer affiliations, friends' ethnic orientation). Findings further revealed some evidence that parent and adolescent gender moderated the patterns, with mothers' (but not fathers') restrictions on peer relationships being associated with adolescents' deviant peer affiliations and parents placing greater restrictions on daughters' than on sons' peer relationships when they had more frequent deviant peer affiliations.

Construction of Social Reality During Early Adolescence: Can Expecting Storm and Stress Increase Real or Perceived Storm and Stress?	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examines whether mothers' or adolescents' expectations concerning "storm and stress" behaviors at adolescence predict subsequent real or perceived adolescent behavior and attributes during the early years of adolescence. The study used a short-term longitudinal design. Participants were 6th- and 7th-grade adolescents and their mothers (N=270 families). Data were collected via telephone interviews and questionnaires at 2 time points approximately 1 year apart. Results indicated that adolescents' expectations for risk-taking/rebelliousness and for alienation and mothers' expectations for risk-taking/rebelliousness predicted increases in corresponding adolescent-reported outcomes over the 1-year period. Results are most consistent with the possibility of perceptual biases with respect to storm and stress behaviors, but could indicate the existence of self-fulfilling prophecies, particularly for risk-taking/rebelliousness.																			1050-8392						2009	19	2					261	285		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00596.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00596.x													WOS:000266243800005

Results showed that for both boys and girls, the trajectories of depressed mood between the ages of 12 and 23 took an inverse U-shape with its peak in mid-adolescence. Furthermore, pubertal timing was a significant predictor of depressed mood at age 12. The pubertal timing effect was nonlinear, suggesting that at age 12, early and late maturing youths were at risk of experiencing elevated levels of depressed mood. The adverse effect of off-time maturation gradually dissipated over time. Moreover, in early adolescence, teenagers, particularly girls, were adversely affected by dating, and off-time physical maturation exacerbated the negative effects of dating. However, the interactive effect of dating and pubertal timing gradually decreased with age. Our findings underscore the importance of examining junctures of biological and social challenges in adolescence to gain better understandings of young people's emotional experiences over time.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2009	19	1					47	74		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00581.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00581.x													WOS:000263521200004

Data for this study were drawn from a multimethod study of ethnically and socioeconomically diverse early adolescents in three mid- to high-achieving schools in New York City. After accounting for the influences of race/ethnicity, social class, gender, immigrant status, and self-esteem, parental ethnic-racial socialization was associated with higher levels of ethnic centrality (i.e., the extent to which youth identify themselves in terms of their group), more positive private regard (i.e., feelings about one's own ethnic group), and public regard (i.e., perceptions of other people's perceptions of their ethnic group). Ethnic discrimination from adults at school and from peers was associated with more negative perceptions of one's ethnic group (i.e., public regard). In addition, the association of ethnic-racial parent socialization and ethnic identity beliefs was stronger for those who reported higher levels of adult discrimination. Results highlight key ways in which ethnic identity may be shaped by the social ecologies in which adolescents are embedded.

J	Hayford, SR; Furstenberg, FF				Hayford, Sarah R.; Furstenberg, Frank F., Jr.			Delayed adulthood, delayed desistance? Trends in the age distribution of problem behaviors	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												As the transition to adulthood becomes more protracted and less orderly, fewer young people occupy adult roles and experience the social control associated with these roles. One might therefore expect behaviors associated with the teenage years to spill over into older age groups, reflecting postponed entrance into full social adulthood. We test this hypothesis by examining trends over time in the age distribution of crime, substance use, and violent death. We find little evidence that behaviors typical of adolescence are moving upward to older ages. Although the achievement of adult roles is being pushed to older ages, this stretching of the transition to adulthood is not reflected in the observed patterns of substance use, violent death, and arrests.

J	Keels, M				Keels, Micere			Second-generation effects of Chicago's Gautreaux residential mobility program on children's participation in crime	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Data from the Gautreaux residential mobility program, which relocated low-income African American families from high poverty, segregated inner-city, Chicago neighborhoods into mostly European American, suburban neighborhoods, and mostly European American or mostly African American neighborhoods within Chicago, are used to assess whether children's later involvement with the Illinois criminal justice system is associated with the characteristics of their placement neighborhoods. I find that suburban placement provides a strong protective benefit for boys, primarily for drug offenses. Conversely, girls placed in suburban neighborhoods were more likely to be convicted of a criminal offense. Qualitative data indicate that children placed in the suburbs experienced a dramatic reduction in direct exposure to gangs and drugs. Children placed in higher SES neighborhoods within Chicago still attended lower performing schools and the surrounding neighborhoods offered many opportunities for participation in delinquent activities.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2008	18	2					305	351		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2008.00562.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2008.00562.x													WOS:000256100900006

A latent growth curve analysis of prosocial behavior among rural adolescents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The present study was designed to investigate stability and changes in prosocial behavior and the parent and peer correlates of prosocial behavior in rural adolescents. Participants were from a rural, low SES community in the Eastern United States. The participants were in 7th, 8th, and 9th grades at Time 1 and 10th, 11th, and 12th grades at Time 4, and completed measures of prosocial behavior and quality of parent and peer relationships. Latent growth curve modeling revealed that despite moderate stability in individual differences in prosocial behavior and slight increases in quality of peer and parent relationships, level of prosocial behavior declined until late high school with a slight rebound in grade 12. Furthermore, increases in the quality of peer relationships predicted decreases in prosocial behavior for girls but not boys. Discussion focuses on continuity and change in prosocial behavior and the gender-based relations between quality of parent and peer relationships and prosocial behaviors in adolescence.

The participants were 734 Swedish adolescents (335 boys and 399 girls) who filled in questionnaires measuring their achievement beliefs and behaviors, depressive symptoms, engagement with school, and norm-breaking behavior. By using clustering-by-cases analysis, five achievement orientation groups were identified: optimism, defensive-pessimism, self-handicapping, and learned helplessness, and a group showing average levels of criteria variables. The results showed further that a decrease in depressive symptoms and an increase in engagement with school predicted a move to the use of optimistic and defensive-pessimistic groups, whereas a reverse pattern predicted a move to the helplessness and self-handicapping groups. Moreover, the optimistic and defensive-pessimistic achievement orientations at Time 1 predicted an increase in engagement with school and a decrease in depressive symptoms later on, whereas self-handicapping and learned helplessness predicted a decrease in engagement with school and increases in depressive symptoms and norm-breaking behavior.

Adolescent reports of family and parenting processes from youth in four countries	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The current investigation cross-nationally examined the relationship between adolescent reports of family or parenting processes and a series of developmental outcomes in a sample of adolescents (N = 8,417) from Hungary, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United States. Based on confirmatory factor analyses and tests of scalar equivalence, results suggest that the Adolescent Family Process Measure (AFP), which assesses maternal and paternal closeness, support, monitoring, communication, conflict, and peer approval, was valid and reliable for males, females, middle adolescents, and late adolescents in all four national contexts. In addition, based on model-free LISREL analyses, findings suggested that the relationships between these family processes and measures of adolescent externalizing (alcohol use, drug use, school misconduct, and total deviance) and internalizing (anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and low well-being) behaviors were similar cross-nationally. Findings are discussed in terms of their importance for the conceptualization and measurement of family and parenting processes.

It also examined the role of parental warmth, low hostility, and child management practices in inhibiting the growth trajectories of these developmental problems. Specifically, parenting was hypothesized to exhibit either a compensatory or buffering effect on age-related increases in adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. Data were collected annually from 319 mothers, fathers, and their adolescent children (168 girls, 151 boys). The results demonstrated significant gender differences in growth trajectories of externalizing and internalizing problems. Both the compensatory and buffering hypotheses were supported with regard to externalizing problems. A compensatory effect of parenting practices on levels of internalizing problems also was demonstrated.

Hierarchical regression analyses showed that adolescents' school perceptions were significant predictors of their academic and psychological adjustment at the end of 8th grade after accounting for their demographic characteristics, prior academic ability, and prior adjustment assessed at the beginning of 7th grade. Perceptions of positive teacher regard and an emphasis on individual effort and improvement in school (school task goal structure) were associated with increases in academic values, feelings of academic competence, and academic achievement; and decreases in depressive symptoms from 7th to 8th grade. Perceived teacher regard also predicted diminished anger and school truancy and increases in self-esteem over time. Perceptions of an emphasis on competition and differential treatment by ability in middle school (school ability goal structure) were related to diminished academic values, feelings of self-esteem, and academic achievement; and increases in school truancy, anger, and depressive symptoms over time. The developmental significance of adolescents' perceptions of middle school for multiple aspects of their adjustment is discussed.																			1050-8392						1998	8	1					123	158		10.1207/s15327795jra0801_6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0801_6													WOS:000071970400006

One of the most critical events for sexual-minority adolescents is disclosing their sexual identity to family members. In this article, empirical research is addressed that documents the percentage of youths who disclose to their families, the time during the "coming-out" process that youths disclose to family members, and the manner in which disclosure occurs. Mother-father differences are explored, and, when applicable, data on disclosure to siblings and extended family members are reviewed. The implications of these findings for youths, parents, and the family system are summarized and future research needs are suggested.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					1998	8	1					49	68		10.1207/s15327795jra0801_3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0801_3													WOS:000071970400003

Screening for disruptive behavior in adolescents at risk using the strengths and difficulties questionnaire	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Disruptive behavior in adolescents is burdensome and may continue into adulthood if left unidentified. The strengths and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ) can screen for disruptive behavior, but its psychometric properties in high-risk samples and ability to predict delinquency warrant further investigation. In 1022 adolescents, we investigated the predictive validity (on average 1.9 years after screening) of the self-reported SDQ on disruptive behavior disorders and delinquency, measured with multi-informant questionnaires and structured interviews. We compared three scoring methods: total, subscale, and dysregulation profile scoring. In this high-risk sample, SDQ subscale scores predicted disruptive behavior outcomes best. Predictive values for the specific types of delinquency were small. Concluding, the SDQ can be used in high-risk settings for early identification of youth with disruptive behavior.

Participants nominated friends and self-reported their tobacco and alcohol use at seventh and again at eighth grade. Longitudinal social network analyses revealed evidence of friend influence but not selection over smoking and drinking. Boys increased their levels of smoking at rates greater than that of girls, but no sex moderation of either selection or influence was found. In interpreting these results, it is important to understand the gender norms for Chinese boys and girls and the cultural context of tobacco and alcohol use.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2023	33	2					591	602		10.1111/jora.12828	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12828		JAN 2023						36625141					WOS:000911336700001

We interviewed 20 diverse adolescents (X = 18.45) about their experiences with bullying and school discipline. Using a qualitative mapping technique, we analyzed the pathways between victimization and punishment that emerged from our participants' narratives. Our analyses revealed that among the adolescents who had experienced victimization related to their sexual orientation and/or gender identity (or expression) (n = 17), most of them (n = 15) had also experienced punishment connected to their victimization. We identified five pathways linking victimization and bullying. Further, we found that the majority of participants were navigating school contexts rife with pervasive and ongoing harassment and that adults ineffectively intervened and often compounded the harm experienced.

Adolescent Bullying and Weapon Carrying: A Longitudinal Investigation	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Using four data waves from an ongoing longitudinal study, we examined the longitudinal association between weapon carrying and bullying (i.e., bully, victim, bully-victim). Participants were 1,042 adolescents (55.9% female) recruited from Texas high schools, including Hispanic (31.7%), White (30.3%), African American (26.6%), and other (11.4%) with a mean age of 15.1 years at baseline. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that only baseline bully-victim was linked to weapon carrying and only 1 year later (Adjusted odds ratio = 1.76, 95% confidence interval: 1.08, 2.85), after controlling for baseline weapon carrying, age, gender, race, and parent education. No significant longitudinal association was found with bully or victim. Findings emphasize the importance of interventions targeting both bullying perpetrators and victims, while also highlighting the necessity of longitudinal research.

A sample of 107 youth and their parents participated in a study spanning from mid-adolescence (T1) to late adolescence (T2). At T1, family members discussed a contentious issue, which was coded for parents' nonverbal warmth. At T1 and T2, youth reported on their friends' and their own risky behaviors. Fathers' warmth moderated each prospective association between deviant peers and risky behaviors. Mothers' warmth did not emerge as a significant moderator. Girls, in particular, benefitted from fathers' warmth as a buffer in the trajectory from T1 risky behaviors to T2 risky behaviors and deviant peers.

In this study effects of a long (10 weekly sessions) and a short (one day, four sessions) cyberbullying prevention program based on the ToRA were compared with a control group over 9 months. Longitudinal data from 722 students (mean age = 13.36) on cyberbullying, somatic symptoms, attitudes, and norms were analyzed within a structural equation model. Participation in the long intervention group significantly reduced cyberbullying (d = -0.584) and somatic symptoms (d = -0.316). No between-group differences emerged for attitudes and norms. Developmental trajectories and associations were found to be as suggested by ToRA in both cross-sectional and change-score analyses.

We examine a life-course perspective and incorporate theories of emotion regulation and self-referent behavior. Using structural equation models and hierarchical growth curve models with the Kaplan Longitudinal and Multigenerational data, the results indicate that parental anger leads to anger in adolescence, supporting theories of learning through modeling in adolescence. In young adulthood, as predicted by self-referent behavior theory, parental anger contributes to increases in self-derogation. Interestingly, maternal anger, but not paternal anger, is correlated with child's anger and self-derogation.

This article assesses the promises and challenges of using bi-weekly mobile diaries administered over the course of a year to study adolescent partnership dynamics. Descriptive findings illustrate the potential of bi-weekly diaries for both capturing the longitudinal complexity and fluidity of adolescent partnerships as well as for reducing retrospection biases. Results also underscore several challenges, including those posed by missing data, and highlight several strategies for maximizing participant engagement and reliably tracing adolescent partnerships.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				SEP	2019	29	3					646	661		10.1111/jora.12472	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12472								31573770					WOS:000488692700008

Developmental Change in Sibling Support and School Commitment Across Adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												School commitment typically declines across adolescence, but the family-level factors that explain this decline have not been fully characterized. This study investigated sibling support as a family resource in predicting school commitment across 7th-10th grade using a sample of 444 adolescents (M-ages = 12.61, 13.59, 14.59, 15.58 years). Results showed that sibling support linearly increased and school commitment decreased and stabilized, independently, over time. Sibling support positively predicted school commitment in seventh grade and across time, suggesting that having supportive siblings may help to offset adolescents' declines in school commitment. Furthermore, having a brother enhanced this association versus having a sister. These findings provide insight into ways to help youth maintain school commitment across the middle- to high school transition.

Longitudinal Change in Adolescents' Prosocial Behavior Toward Strangers, Friends, and Family	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												There is little understanding about how prosocial behavior toward different targets might change over time, and what might promote initial levels and age-related changes in prosocial behavior. Thus, this study examined longitudinal change in prosocial behavior toward strangers, friends, and family from early adolescence through the transition to adulthood. Participants included 500 adolescents from the United States (age 12 to age 20; 52% female, 65% European American). Latent growth curve models suggested that prosocial behavior toward strangers increased across early to mid-adolescence and then flattened out during the transition to adulthood, prosocial behavior toward friends increased steadily, and prosocial behavior toward family was relatively stable across adolescence and then increased. Predictors of initial levels and growth in prosocial behavior varied by target.

The study also explored the consistency of this model across families from varied cultural backgrounds. Participants were 143 Jewish-Israeli mother-adolescent dyads from three cultural groups: immigrants from the Former Soviet Union, immigrants from Western countries, and native-born Israelis. Maternal sensitive guidance was observed during mother-adolescent dialogues about emotional experiences. Adolescents' representations were assessed via their narratives regarding their mother and their relationship. Examiners reported adolescents' behavior problems. Results indicated that across cultural groups adolescents' more coherent representations partially mediated the association between higher maternal sensitive guidance and fewer adolescent behavior problems.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				MAR	2018	28	1			SI		211	228		10.1111/jora.12327	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12327								28656678					WOS:000425591200018

Early Sexual Initiation and Mental Health: A Fleeting Association or Enduring Change?	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The present research examined how the within-person association between sexual initiation and internalizing symptoms decays over time, using data with annual measurement occasions across adolescence (N=1,789) and statistical models of within-person change. Sexual initiation was associated with increased levels of internalizing symptoms for early-initiating girls (ninth grade, approximately age 15), but not for on-time-initiating girls or for boys. The association between girls' early sexual initiation and internalizing symptoms declined precipitously over time. Indeed, 1year after sexual debut, early-initiating girls were similar to on-time or noninitiating girls on internalizing symptoms, suggesting early sexual initiation does not produce lasting detriments to girls' mental health. Findings inform how researchers perceive sexual initiation, both as a developmental milestone and as a prevention target.

The Role of Mothers' Communication in Promoting Motivation for Math and Science Course-Taking in High School	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												In the context of concerns about American youths' failure to take advanced math and science (MS) courses in high school, we examined mothers' communication with their adolescent about taking MS courses. At ninth grade, U.S. mothers (n=130) were interviewed about their responses to hypothetical questions from their adolescent about the usefulness of algebra, geometry, calculus, biology, chemistry, and physics. Responses were coded for elaboration and making personal connections to the adolescent. The number of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics courses taken in 12th grade was obtained from school records. Mothers' use of personal connections predicted adolescents' MS interest and utility value, as well as actual MS course-taking. Parents can play an important role in motivating their adolescent to take MS courses.

Sexual Risk-Taking Among Recently Emancipated Female Foster Youth: Sexual Trauma and Failed Family Reunification Experiences	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Foster youth evidence shows elevated rates of risk behaviors, including sexual risk-taking (e.g., unprotected sex). Some studies have identified child maltreatment, particularly sexual abuse, as a risk for later sexual risk-taking, but none have examined how child welfare placement experiences relate to youth's sexual risk-taking. This study investigated relations among child maltreatment, child welfare placements, and sexual risk-taking among 114 recently emancipated female foster youth. Sexual abuse and failed reunifications with parents were associated with greater sexual risk-taking. Moreover, dissociative symptoms exacerbated the relation between sexual abuse and sexual risk-taking. These findings highlight the need for greater consideration of risks associated with emancipated youth's sexual risk-taking and for more research to understand how youth experience unsuccessful family reunifications.

Maternal Regulation of Daughters' Emotion During Conflicts From Early to Mid-Adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Primary caregivers play an important role in emotion socialization. Real-time mother-daughter emotion socialization was examined in 45 mother-daughter dyads with early-adolescent daughters (age M = 11.80, SD=.27) at the first observation point. Maternal supportive emotion regulation and daughters' emotions were coded during two conflict discussions, 2 years apart. With multilevel survival analysis, the likelihood of maternal supportiveness was predicted both over time, between early and mid-adolescence, and by daughters' pubertal status. Mothers were more likely to respond to daughters' negative and positive emotions with supportiveness for daughters whose pubertal maturation occurred relatively early. Results suggest that mothers adjust their socialization of daughters' emotions according to their daughters' pubertal development.

Two hundred and twenty-three mothers listed and ranked their five most important goals for their children (mean age = 12.85 years). Children ranked the importance of the goals listed by their mothers and explained why they were or were not important to them. American mothers placed heightened emphasis on their children maintaining feelings of worth and pursuing what they enjoy. Chinese mothers stressed their children achieving outcomes, as did African American mothers. European American children's rankings of importance were the least similar to those of their mothers, and they gave the fewest autonomous reasons for importance, suggesting that their adoption of mothers' goals was weakest.

The model examined negative LGB identity as a mediator of the relationships between (1) religious stress and mental health, and (2) gay-related stress and mental health. The data indicated that negative LGB identity fully accounted for both relationships. Findings suggest that a negative sense of sexual identity for LGB youth helps explain the links between religious and gay-related stressors and mental health. As LGB youth may have limited control over these stressors, the importance of helping LGB youth maintain a positive LGB identity, despite homonegative messages from others, is discussed.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				DEC	2013	23	4					665	677		10.1111/jora.12025	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12025								24244081					WOS:000326945400007

Testing Alternative Explanations for the Associations Between Parenting and Adolescent Suicidal Problems	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Although studies have established associations between parenting characteristics and adolescent suicidality, the strength of the evidence for these links remains unclear, largely because of methodological limitations, including lack of accounting for possible child effects on parenting. This study addresses these issues by using autoregressive cross-lag models with data on 802 adolescents and their parents across 5years. Observed parenting behaviors predicted change in adolescent suicidal problems across 1-year intervals even after controlling for adolescents' effects on parenting. Nurturant-involved parenting continued to demonstrate salutary effects after controlling for adolescent and parent internalizing psychopathology: over time, observed nurturant-involved parenting reduced the likelihood of adolescent suicidal problems.

Trajectories of Reinforcement Sensitivity During Adolescence and Risk for Substance Use	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Developmental neuroscience models suggest that changes in responsiveness to incentives contribute to increases in adolescent risk behavior, including substance use. Trajectories of sensitivity to reward (SR) and sensitivity to punishment (SP) were examined and tested as predictors of escalation of early substance use in a community sample of adolescents (N=765, mean baseline age 11.8years, 54% female). SR and SP were assessed using a laboratory task. Across three annual assessments, SR increased, and rapid escalation was associated with increases in substance use. SP declined and was unrelated to substance use.

J	Murray-Close, D				Murray-Close, Dianna			Psychophysiology of Adolescent Peer Relations I: Theory and Research Findings	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Developmental psychologists have become increasingly interested in how psychophysiological processes relate to adolescent peer functioning. This review discusses advances in the study of the psychophysiology of adolescent peer relations, with a focus on how the autonomic and neuroendocrine systems relate to antisocial behavior, victimization, and peer social status (i.e., dominance, likeability, and popularity). The theoretical and psychological significance assigned to psychophysiological measures is discussed to provide a framework for adolescent peer researchers interested in incorporating these measures into their programs of research. Next, evidence that physiological arousal predicts peer-based behaviors and that experiences with peers may alter the functioning of physiological systems is reviewed. Throughout, the motivational, regulatory, and emotional processes thought to underlie these associations are highlighted.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2013	23	2			SI		236	259		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2012.00828.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2012.00828.x													WOS:000319332400005

The Protective Role of Religious Coping in Adolescents' Responses to Poverty and Sexual Decision-Making in Rural Kenya	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												In this study, we explored how adolescents in rural Kenya apply religious coping in sexual decision-making in the context of high rates of poverty and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 34 adolescents. One-third (13) reported religious coping related to economic stress, HIV, or sexual decision-making; the majority (29) reported religious coping with these or other stressors. Adolescents reported praying to God to partner with them to engage in positive behaviors, praying for strength to resist unwanted behaviors, and passive strategies characterized by waiting for God to provide resources or protection from HIV. Adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa may benefit from HIV prevention interventions that integrate and build upon their use of religious coping.																			1050-8392						2012	22	1					1	7		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2011.00760.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2011.00760.x								22505794					WOS:000300680500001
J	Byrd, CM; Chavous, T				Byrd, Christy M.; Chavous, Tabbye			Racial Identity, School Racial Climate, and School Intrinsic Motivation Among African American Youth: The Importance of Person-Context Congruence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Researchers have been concerned with whether strong racial identification promotes or inhibits achievement motivation among African American youth, but current literatures have paid little attention to the role of youths' contexts. In this study, we outline a racial identity-context congruence framework that predicts positive benefits of a strong, positive racial identity when the context is congruent with youths' beliefs. To test this framework, we examined school racial climate as a moderator in the relationships of three racial identity variables (centrality, private regard, and public regard) with intrinsic motivation for attending school in a sample of 11th graders. Overall, results support the congruence perspective and also demonstrate how feelings of belonging at school mediate the relationship between racial identity-racial climate congruence and school intrinsic motivation.

A Test of the Economic Strain Model on Adolescents' Prosocial Behaviors	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The present study was designed to examine the links between economic strain, parental depression, parent-child connectedness, and adolescents' prosocial behaviors. The sample consisted of 478 participants (M age at Time 1 = 11.29 years, 51% male) recruited from the community who were mostly of European American descent (69%) and from mostly middle to upper SES families. At Time 1 parents completed measures of their own income and economic stress, depression, and connectedness with their child. At Time 1 adolescents reported on connectedness with both their mother and father. At Time 2 (1 year later) adolescents reported on their own prosocial behavior toward strangers, friends, and family. Structural equation model tests showed that economic strain was related positively to parental depressive symptoms, which in turn predicted lower levels of parent-child connectedness, which in turn positively predicted adolescents' prosocial behaviors. Discussion focuses on the family context of adolescents' positive behavioral outcomes.

Direct and Moderating Effects of Social Affordances on School Involvement and Delinquency Among Young Adolescents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Using social control theory and attachment theory as guides, this study examined how qualities of young adolescents' social relationships (i.e., mother, sibling, and friend) and dynamic interactions among characteristics of those relationships are associated with school involvement and delinquency. The participants included older siblings (M age=14.3), younger siblings (M age=11.6), and their mothers from 434 families who completed web-based surveys. Results were largely consistent with tenets of social control theory and attachment theory. Young adolescents' social relationships mostly worked in additive ways, but sometimes in compensatory ways for older siblings, to promote positive adjustment. The results suggest that young adolescents' social relationships may be differently associated with adjustment depending on birth order or developmental stage.																			1050-8392						2010	20	4					811	824		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00669.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00669.x													WOS:000284275700001

Baseline and follow-up in-home Audio-Computer Assisted Self Interview surveys were completed by 854 Black and White male and female adolescents who, at baseline, were 12-14 years old and had not engaged in sexual intercourse. Results showed that stronger connections to parents and schools and less exposure to permissive sexual norms from peers and media were associated with less susceptibility and sexual behavior, especially among White adolescents. Susceptibility mediated 38-64% of the relations between parent and school socialization and sexual intercourse behavior, and mediated 28-53% of the peer and media socialization links to behavior. Findings provide support for social cognitive models of adolescents' behavior and suggest potential strategies for successful interventions to delay initiation of sexual intercourse.

Low-income Latina mothers' expectations for their pregnant daughters' autonomy and interdependence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Forty-five pregnant Latina adolescents and their mothers (23 English-speaking, 22 Spanish-speaking) were videotaped conversing about feelings and plans related to the adolescent's pregnancy. The prevalence of the mothers' messages about the daughter's reliance on the family unit (interdependence) and the daughter's self-sufficiency (autonomy) were related to adolescents' reported and observed feelings about their pregnancies, pending motherhood challenges, and their relationships with their mothers. Increased interdependence messages appeared to denote positive family relations among Spanish-speaking dyads, in that these adolescents reported more positive feelings about their pregnancy, perceived that their mothers felt more positive, and perceived more maternal social support and open communication. The role of interdependence messages was less clear for adolescents from English-speaking families. Higher levels of maternal autonomy messages had positive associations for both groups, in that it was related to higher disclosure about concerns about childcare needs among adolescents from English-speaking families, and about educational goals for adolescents from Spanish-speaking families.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2008	18	2					215	238		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2008.00558.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2008.00558.x													WOS:000256100900002

Patterns of racial socialization and psychological adjustment:: Can parental communications about race reduce the impact of racial discrimination?	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study uses two waves of data to examine the relations among racial discrimination experiences, patterns of racial socialization practices, and psychological adjustment in a sample of 361 African American adolescents. Using latent class analyses, we identified four patterns of child-reported racial socialization experiences: Moderate Positive, High Positive, Low Frequency, and Moderate Negative. Experiencing racial discrimination was associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms, more perceived stress, and lower levels of well-being. On average, adolescents who experienced High Positive patterns of racial socialization reported the most positive psychological adjustment outcomes, while adolescents in the Low Frequency and Moderate Negative clusters reported the least favorable outcomes. Results suggest that High Positive racial socialization buffers the negative effects of racial discrimination on adolescents' perceived stress and problem behaviors. Together, the findings suggest that various patterns of racial socialization practices serve as risk, compensatory, and protective factors in African American adolescent psychological adjustment.

Adolescents' and their mothers' perceptions of parental management of peer relationships	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The purpose of the present investigation was to examine the relation of level and discrepancy in mothers' and adolescents' reports of parental management of peer relationships and parent-child conflict about peer relationships to mothers' and adolescent's reports of adolescents' drug use, delinquent behavior, and grade-point-average (GPA). An ethnically diverse sample of 121 seventh and eighth graders and their mothers completed questionnaires assessing the degree to which mothers managed peer relationships, parent-child conflict about peer relationships, and adolescents' drug use, delinquent behavior, and GPA. Differences in mothers' versus adolescents' reports were found for parental management of peers and conflict about peer relationships. Results suggest that both level and discrepancies between mothers' and adolescents' reports of parenting are important in predicting the outcome variables. Furthermore, the direction of the discrepancy was important in determining its relation to the outcome variables.

Longitudinal patterns of daily affect and global mood during adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined grade and sex patterns in real-time measures of daily mood using Ecological Momentary Assessments via palmtop computers among 8th (N = 296) and I Oth graders (N = 266) for 1 year using a threewave longitudinal design. Participants responded to five to seven random prompts/day for 7 consecutive days; when prompted, participants rated eight mood adjectives assessing positive affect (PA) and negative affect (NA). Global depressed mood was also assessed via self-report questionnaire at every wave. Mixed-effects regression analyses indicated that PA modestly but significantly declined across Grade 8 to 11, but NA was relatively stable over time. Sex by time interactions showed that boys experienced greater declines in daily mood over time than did girls. In contrast, global depressed mood did not change over time, and girls reported higher depressed mood than boys. Findings suggest that normative mood declines in adolescence may be driven by deteriorations in PA, rather than increases in NA.

Examining school connectedness as a mediator of school climate effects	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Researchers have suggested that good-quality school climates foster a sense of connection to the school and in this way contribute to fewer emotional and behavioral problems. However, few studies have directly assessed the role of school connectedness as a mediator of school climate effects. Using path analysis, this brief report examined whether four aspects of student perceived school climate (cohesion, friction, competition among students, and overall satisfaction with classes) were indirectly associated with subsequent early adolescent conduct problems and depressive symptoms through school connectedness. Participants were four hundred and eighty-nine 10- to 14-year old middle school students involved in two waves of a study. The results showed that school connectedness mediated the relations between perceived cohesion, perceived friction, and overall satisfaction with classes and subsequent student conduct problems 1 year later. School connectedness was not, however, predictive of subsequent depressive symptoms and thus did not mediate the school climate effects on early adolescent emotional problems.																			1050-8392						2006	16	3					491	501		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2006.00504.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2006.00504.x													WOS:000239334400007

This study investigates the links between rural adolescents' residential preferences and their plans for the future, perceptions of local opportunity, and ties to family and community. We examine whether residential preferences shape the pathways to adulthood through decisions about where to live as well as educational and occupational attainments. Residential preferences are indeed related to adolescents' academic achievements and future educational plans, their relationships with parents, and perceptions of local job opportunities, but they are not associated with family socioeconomic background and social ties to the community. For the most part, residential preferences are linked to where young people live and pursue higher education in the years after high school, but generally not to their socioeconomic attainment.

A sample of 198 adolescents was followed three times over a 6-year period, from ages 17 to 23. Questionnaire measures of generative concern, parenting style, community involvement, and personal adjustment were collected. Adolescents' generative concern was positively related to good adjustment, as has been observed previously among adults. Generative concern at age 23 was predicted by earlier reports of family authoritative parenting, and especially by higher levels of earlier prosocial community involvement among these adolescents. Overall, results suggest that generativity may be a developing element in the domain of prosocial moral concern in later adolescence, and that family and community roots may be important in its establishment.																			1050-8392						2005	15	3					261	273		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2005.00096.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2005.00096.x													WOS:000231146300003

Few associations between grandmother involvement and behavior emerged, and these were moderated by coresidence. In contrast, partner involvement showed a number of significant (positive) direct and moderated relations with behavior. For both providers, the direction of the relations between social support and behavior during teaching was the opposite depending on coresidence: Greater social support was related to the display of more positive behavior among coresiding mothers but to less competent behavior among non-coresiding mothers. The relations between child care support and behavior differed across providers. For grandmothers, greater child care was related to less positive behavior during teaching among coresiding mothers but to more competent behavior among non-coresiding mothers. For partners, greater child care was more strongly related to positive behavior during play among non-coresiding than coresiding mothers.

In individual interviews, 141 sixth, eighth, and tenth graders and their mothers responded to hypothetical vignettes in which a child story character wished to exercise a right that conflicted with parental practices. For each vignette, participants were asked to judge whether the story character should have the right in question and to provide a justification for their decision. Generally, eighth and tenth graders were more likely than their mothers to endorse requests for self-determination and less likely than their mothers to support requests for nurturance. Mothers of tenth graders were more likely to support requests for self-determination and less likely to favor adolescents' request for nurturance in the home than were mothers of sixth and eighth graders. In terms of reasoning, adolescents and mothers were more likely to consider the individuals' rights when discussing self-determination situations, whereas nurturance situations elicited responses pertaining to participants' understanding of familial roles and relationships. Furthermore, mothers' reasoning about children's rights reflected sensitivity to the developmental level of their children. The findings are discussed in terms of previous research on the development of children's understanding of rights and adolescent autonomy.

Older youths reported more sexual intercourse. Age was controlled in all analyses. Sexually active youths reported more conflict with parents and sexual intercourse among friends. Youths involved with illegal substances reported that more friends used illegal substances. Although boys were more likely than girls to report sexual intercourse, they did not differ in number of partners or condom use. Girls reported higher rates of parental monitoring and more support from their families and communities. There were no differences in delinquency, sensation seeking, intelligence, or locus of control associated with risk practices. Early sexuality was not linked with other risk practices, suggesting that, within this culture, early sexual intercourse is not part of a general theory of problem behavior.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					1997	7	2					173	195		10.1207/s15327795jra0702_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0702_4													WOS:A1997WQ17300004

Data were drawn from a 3-year longitudinal study of a community sample of children of alcoholics (COAs) and demographically matched controls. Parent alcoholism had a direct effect on adolescent heavy drinking. Compared to non-COAs, COAs started out at higher initial levels of heavy drinking and increased their heavy drinking at a steeper rate over the three waves of measurement. However, expectancies concerning negative alcohol effects (negative expectancies) and expectancies concerning positive alcohol effects (positive expectancies) were unrelated to growth in adolescents' heavy drinking. Thus, alcohol expectancies did not mediate parent alcoholism effects on trajectories of adolescent drinking. There was some cross-sectional evidence that adolescents' positive expectancies mediated the effects of parent alcoholism on initial levels of adolescent heavy drinking. Children of alcoholic fathers reported higher levels of positive expectancies than did non-COAs, and positive expectancies predicted high initial levels of heavy drinking. Although weak adolescent negative expectancies were associated with high initial levels of alcohol use, they were unrelated to parent alcoholism. Implications of these findings for COA risk and escalation of heavy drinking in the adolescent years are discussed.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					1997	7	4					349	374		10.1207/s15327795jra0704_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0704_1													WOS:A1997YA02100001

It was predicted that the exosystem variables of parental work environment and parental social support would have an indirect impact on externalizing by influencing the microsystem variables of parental warmth, parental use of restrictive control, and conflict within the family. Path analysis indicated that this two-step model adequately fit the data. An additional set of analyses showed that the complete ecological model was a better fit than a more restricted model in which exosystem variables were excluded.

A sample of 1987 students, comprising 56.10% male participants with a mean age of 12.32 years (SD = 0.53), from Guangdong and Shandong provinces, completed the Deviant Peer Affiliation Scale and the Externalizing Behavior Scale in biannual surveys. The surveys were conducted in the autumn semester of 7th grade, the spring semester of 7th grade, and the autumn semester of 8th grade. The cross-lagged panel model illustrated a bidirectional association between adolescents' involvement with deviant peers and externalizing behavior. Conversely, the random intercepts cross-lagged panel model indicated a positive association between deviant peer affiliation and externalizing behavior at the between-person level. At the within-person level, a significant predictive correlation was identified between the association with deviant peers and subsequent externalizing behavior, whereas the reverse pathway was determined to be statistically insignificant. To comprehend the connection between deviant peer association and externalizing behavior in preadolescence, it is essential to differentiate between between-person and within-person effects and utilize a sophisticated research methodology.

We present a new model of adolescent digital emotion regulation as a conceptual framework to help guide burgeoning research in this area. We distinguish two primary processes: the regulation of emotions that have been elicited within digital contexts (i.e., the regulation of digitally induced emotions), and how youth regulate their emotions through digital means (i.e., digitally regulated emotion). Following the explication of different pathways in the model and consideration of the affordances of digital contexts, we highlight how this framework connects to theory and guides future research.

An interdisciplinary framework of youth participatory action research informed by curricula, youth, adults, and researchers	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Rarely are youth voices incorporated into program and policy development. Youth participatory action research (YPAR) is an opportunity for adolescents to develop research skills by completing projects relevant to their lives and allows participation and decision-making at systems and organizational levels. Attention to YPAR implementation detail, especially a curricular focus, is lacking in the literature. Specifically absent is an all-encompassing YPAR framework, a gap the current study addresses. The current study includes a review of existing YPAR curricula to develop the Youth Researcher Empowerment Framework, including research components, social emotional competencies, and assumptions necessary for completing a YPAR project that centers youth voice and shared power. The study includes a quantitative assessment of the YPAR curricula and qualitative reviews by adult practitioners. In addition, focus group data from youth and teacher audiences across multiple settings confirmed and clarified terms and concepts related to the framework. The study provides empirical evidence to support a revised framework for YPAR curricular implementation. Implications are discussed in terms of aspects of the research process needed for YPAR projects, attention to specific youth developmental skills as outcomes, and underlying principles needed to create a welcoming, contextual space allowing for empowerment, youth voice, and choice.

Testing interpersonal style to explain the victimization-depression link	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study tested to what extent the relation between bullying victimization and future symptoms of depression could be explained by victims being more hostile and less assertive than non-involved individuals. Data came from waves 2-4 of the Dutch TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS). Participants' bullying experiences were assessed at age 13, interpersonal style at age 16, and depression symptoms at age 19. Mediation analyses were performed primarily on 274 self-reported victims and 1498 non-involved peers. Self-reported victims had an increased risk for depression symptoms. About a third of that risk could be explained by victims' hostile style, which was also higher than those of non-involved peers. Although victims also reported lower levels of assertiveness than non-involved peers, this interpersonal style did not mediate the link between bullying victimization and depression. Our findings suggest that high hostility, but not low assertiveness, partly explains the increased depression risk of self-reported victims. Therefore, interventions could focus on addressing hostility, to help reduce the likelihood that adolescents who have experienced bullying victimization will have more interpersonal conflicts and mental health problems in the future. Supplementary materials also include analyses for bullies and bully-victims, and for peer-reported measures.					de Jong, Peter/ABB-1750-2020; Franzen, Minita/IAL-9130-2023; aan het Rot, Marije/H-8708-2019; Veenstra, Rene/G-6696-2011; van Duijn, Marijtje/E-8790-2013; de Jong, Peter/E-9095-2014	Veenstra, Rene/0000-0001-6686-6307; Franzen, Minita/0000-0003-4495-8993; aan het Rot, Marije/0000-0001-6761-7513; van Duijn, Marijtje/0000-0003-0753-3208; de Jong, Peter/0000-0002-3512-3663													1050-8392	1532-7795				2024 JUL 23	2024										10.1111/jora.13005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.13005		JUL 2024						39044317					WOS:001274475700001

The impact of COVID-19 on the peer relationships of adolescents around the world: A rapid systematic review	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The main objective of this rapid systematic review was to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted peer relationships for adolescents (10-25 years of age) around the globe. We focused on four indices of peer relationships: (1) loneliness, (2) social connectedness, (3) social support, and (4) social media use. In addition, we examined gender and age differences. Four databases (APA PsychInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched for articles published from January 2020 to November 2022. A total of 96 studies (cross-sectional: n = 66, longitudinal: n = 30, quantitative: n = 67, qualitative: n = 12, mixed-methods: n = 17) met our inclusion criteria (empirical observational studies with data on at least one of the indices of interest, cross-sectional data on COVID-19-related experiences or longitudinal data collected during the pandemic, age range of 10-25 years, typically developing adolescents). We extracted data and conducted a narrative synthesis. Findings suggest that COVID-19 disruptions negatively impacted peer relationships for youth. Most studies reported either an increase in loneliness over the course of the pandemic or a positive association between loneliness and COVID-19-related experiences. Similar findings were observed for increased social media use as a means of continued communication and connection. Fewer studies focused on social support but those that did reported a decrease or negative association with COVID-19-related experiences. Lastly, findings suggest a mixed impact on social connectedness, which might be due to the strengthening of closer ties and weakening of more distant relationships. Results for gender differences were mixed, and a systematic comparison of differences across ages was not possible. The heterogeneity in measures of COVID-19-related experiences as well as timing of data collection prevented a more nuanced examination of short and more long-term impacts.

We examined bidirectional associations between race-based experiences and awareness of systemic racism-operationalized as understanding systemic causes of racial disparities in education. Adolescents who self-identified as African American/Black were surveyed in Grade 6 (n = 317; M-age = 11.12; 48% girls) and Grade 8 (n = 247; M-age = 13.15; 56% girls). Cross-lagged panel analyses revealed that racial barrier messages, but not racial discrimination experiences, in Grade 6 positively predicted awareness of systemic racism in Grade 8. Adolescents' awareness of systemic racism in Grade 6 did not predict racial socialization or racial discrimination experiences in Grade 8.

Similarities between friends on service, activism, and awareness of inequities in an adolescent social network	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This brief report characterizes the tendency of adolescent friends to be similar on civic behaviors and critical consciousness. Using two waves of network data from a high school that serves primarily low-income Latine youth (2019, N = 519; 2020, N = 521), the present study examined homophily on service, activism, and awareness of inequities. The results of Exponential Random Graph Models indicated that adolescents tended to be friends with peers who had similar service behavior and awareness of inequities, but not activism. The findings suggest that schools could foster civic engagement by providing infrastructure that encourages civic interactions between peers. The current study highlights the potential that social network analysis holds for generating novel insights into the relational underpinnings of youth civic engagement.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				DEC	2023	33	4					1458	1464		10.1111/jora.12880	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12880		AUG 2023						37559441					WOS:001045072500001

Long-Term RCT outcomes for adolescent alcohol and cannabis use within a predominantly Hispanic sample	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Because adolescents are unlikely to seek, receive, or complete treatment for alcohol and/or cannabis misuse, it is important to enhance the lasting impact of clinical contacts when they do occur. Adolescents (N = 506; 72.5% Hispanic) were randomized to motivational interviewing (MI) versus alcohol and cannabis education (ACE). Latent growth models estimated change over time. Significant reductions in alcohol use were observed, with slightly greater reductions by 12-month follow-up for MI. Both interventions significantly reduced cannabis use, with no treatment group differences. When outcomes were examined comparing Hispanic to non-Hispanic participants, there were no significant differences in intervention efficacy by group. MI's inherently client-centered and culturally adaptive approach may contribute to its equitable degree of behavior change for youth across race/ethnic backgrounds.

JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												In a study of conflict recovery and adolescent dating aggression, 14- to 18-year-old couples (N = 209 dyads) participated in a 1-hr observational assessment. Negative behavior was observed during conflict-evoking "hot" tasks and in a "cooldown" task. Physical and psychological dating aggression were assessed via questionnaires. Negative behavior measured in the cooldown task was not associated with dating aggression after controlling for carryover effects of negativity from the hot to cooldown tasks. Moreover, cooldown negativity moderated the associations of hot task negativity and dating aggression. Actor and partner effects were disentangled via dyadic data analyses. Given the paucity of observational studies of dating aggression, our findings are an important contribution to the literature and in need of replication and extension.

Furthermore, the relation between social avoidance and externalizing problems seldom has been investigated despite reasons to expect an association. We examined the association between social avoidance and externalizing problems using a sample of early adolescents in the United States using parents' reports (N = 294; 54.1% boys; M age = 12.43 years). Supporting our hypotheses, structural equation models indicated that social avoidance positively predicted concurrent externalizing problems, controlling for shyness, unsociability, and internalizing problems (including depression and anxiety). Findings highlight that socially avoidant adolescents' behaviors may include avoiding others as well as acting out. Longitudinal work is needed to examine the potential bidirectional relations between social avoidance and externalizing problems.

However, the genetic and environmental influences that underlie this co-occurrence are understudied. Using a large twin sample (N = 1,017), we examined cross-sectional genetic and environmental influences on ADHD and anxiety symptoms during childhood. We also explored whether these influences were shared with attentional control, a putative mechanism for symptom comorbidity. We found evidence for common genetic and nonshared environmental influences on the covariation among attentional control, ADHD, and anxiety symptoms, supporting the putative role of attentional control as a mechanism by which comorbid problems may develop. Genetic factors also accounted for symptom co-occurrence after controlling for covariation with attentional control, suggesting the presence of additional unmeasured mechanisms.

Differential Behavioral and Neural Profiles in Youth With Conduct Problems During Risky Decision-Making	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Neuroimaging work has examined neural processes underlying risk taking in adolescence, yet predominantly in low-risk youth. To determine whether we can extrapolate from current neurobiological models, this functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigated risk taking and peer effects in youth with conduct problems (CP; N = 19) and typically developing youth (TD; N = 25). Results revealed higher real-life risk taking, lower risky decisions, and no peer effects on a risk-taking task in CP youth. CP youth showed greater ventral striatum (VS) activity during safe than risky decisions, whereas TD youth showed greater VS activation during risky decisions. Differential VS activity explained higher real-life risk taking in CP youth. Findings provide preliminary evidence that risk-taking behavior in youth with CD problems is characterized by differential neural patterns.

Adolescent Externalizing Problems: Contributions of Community Crime Exposure and Neural Function During Emotion Introspection in Mexican-Origin Youth	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Models of the etiology of adolescent antisocial behavior suggest that externalizing problems may reflect a susceptibility to crime exposure and a diminished capacity for emotion introspection. In this study, adolescents of Mexican origin completed a neuroimaging task that involved rating their subjective feelings of sadness in response to emotional facial expressions or a nonemotional aspect of each face. At lower levels of neural activity during sadness introspection in posterior cingulate and left temporoparietal junction, and in left amygdala, brain regions involved in mentalizing and emotion, respectively, a stronger positive association between community crime exposure and externalizing problems was found.

In addition, they examine how youth's adverse life experiences moderate the pathways in this model, an analysis notably missing from much of the academic engagement literature. They find that students' academic self-efficacy mediates parent and teacher support and youth academic engagement.

Most youth displayed adaptively regulated patterns comprised of low overt and subjective distress. Under-controlled adolescents exhibited elevated observable and subjective anger. Over-controlled adolescents were withdrawn and reported heightened subjective distress. Physiologically reactive adolescents had elevated cortisol coupled with low overt and subjective distress. Regulation patterns were associated with unique mental health trajectories. Under-controlled adolescents had elevated conduct and peer problems whereas over-controlled adolescents had higher anxiety and depressive symptoms.

Mother-Adolescent Proficiency in a Common Language Facilitates Socialization Among Mexican-Origin Families	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The primary goal of this study was to test how mother and adolescent proficiency in a common language moderates the link from parenting to adolescent development. A sample of Mexican-origin fifth-grade adolescents (N=674, 50% female) was measured longitudinally on self-control and aggression. Mothers were rated on observed positive discipline, warmth, and harsh discipline. Positive discipline and warm parenting predicted increases in self-control and decreases in aggression, but only among mother-adolescent dyads who were proficient in a common language. Harsh parenting predicted decreases in self-control and increases in aggression, but only among dyads who were not proficient in a common language. Similar results were found in a conceptual replication among a second sample of 167 Mexican-origin adolescents.

The Meaningful Roles Intervention: An Evolutionary Approach to Reducing Bullying and Increasing Prosocial Behavior	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Bullying is a problem that affects adolescents worldwide. Efforts to prevent bullying have been moderately successful at best, or iatrogenic at worst. We offer an explanation for this limited success by employing an evolutionary-psychological perspective to analyze antibullying interventions. We argue that bullying is a goal-directed behavior that is sensitive to benefits as well as costs, and that interventions must address these benefits. This perspective led us to develop a novel antibullying intervention, Meaningful Roles, which offers bullies prosocial alternatives-meaningful roles and responsibilities implemented through a school jobs program and reinforced through peer-to-peer praise notes-that effectively meet the same status goals as bullying behavior. We describe this new intervention and how its theoretical evolutionary roots may be applicable to other intervention programs.

Why Trust Matters: How Confidence in Leaders Transforms What Adolescents Gain From Youth Programs	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Youth's trust in program leaders is considered a key to the positive impact of youth programs. We sought to understand how trust influences youth's program experiences from their perspective. We interviewed 108 ethnically diverse youth (ages 12-19) participating in 13 arts, leadership, and technology programs. Analysis of these accounts suggested five ways in which youth's trust in leaders amplified program benefits. Trust increased youth's (1) confidence in leaders' guidance in program activities, (2) motivation in the program, (3) use of leaders for mentoring, (4) use of leaders as a model of a well-functioning relationship, and (5) experience of program cohesiveness. Across benefits, trust allowed youth to draw on leaders' expertise, opened them to new experiences, and helped increase youth's agency.

To understand this balancing in daily practice, we interviewed 25 experienced (M = 14 years) leaders of arts, leadership, and technology programs for high-school-aged youth. We obtained accounts of when, how, and why they gave advice, set limits, and "supported youth when disagreeing." Qualitative analysis found surprising similarities across leaders. They used authority to give advice and set limits, but did so with reasoned restraint. Maximizing youth's opportunities to learn from experience was central in their decision making. They described employing authority in intentional ways aimed at helping youth's work succeed, strengthening youth's agency, and building skills for agency (e.g., critical thinking, "clarifying intent").

Sexual Behaviors in Mexico: The Role of Values and Gender Across Adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Adolescent sexuality research has expanded to include noncoital behaviors, but there is limited knowledge about individual factors such as cultural values associated with these sexual behaviors outside of industrialized nations. Thus, we examined associations between Latino values (familism, sexual guilt, and importance of female virginity) and three sexual behaviors (making out, oral sex, and vaginal sex), among adolescents ages 12-19 (53% female) in Mexico. Findings indicate that sexual guilt and importance of female virginity were consistently associated with all sexual behaviors. Some associations differed by gender and school level. For instance, sexual guilt was a better predictor of high school girls' oral and vaginal sex. This study expands our understanding of adolescent sexuality in Mexico.

Snooping might uncover additional information, but also strongly violates privacy expectations. Three studies of parents and adolescents examined distinctions between snooping, solicitation, and control. Differences existed in terms of factor structure and frequency (Studies 1-2), links to perceived invasion (Study 1), correlations with problematic communication, behavior, and relationships (Study 2), and parent-adolescent (dis)agreement about acceptability (Study 3). Snooping is a relatively infrequent monitoring behavior, compared to solicitation and control, but appears to be a stronger indicator of problems in adolescent and family functioning. We discuss implications regarding the necessity and appropriateness of particular parental monitoring behaviors.

Recent-immigrant Hispanic parent-adolescent dyads (N = 302) completed measures of acculturation and family functioning. Adolescents completed measures of positive youth development, depressive symptoms, problem behavior, and substance use. Results indicated that Time 1 discrepancies in Hispanic culture retention, and linear trajectories in some of these discrepancies, negatively predicted adolescent positive youth development, and positively predicted adolescent depressive symptoms and binge drinking, indirectly through adolescent-reported family functioning. The vast majority of effects were mediated rather than direct, supporting the acculturation discrepancy hypothesis.

This cross-sectional study qualitatively assessed 112 high-frequency, cannabis-using university students in Canada: It examined their subjective expectations regarding what they anticipated their cannabis use would look like in the short- and mid-term future and explored factors they saw potentially contributing to changes in their prospective drug use. Results indicated that participants believe that decisions about future cannabis use will be influenced by several contextual factors, including education and employment responsibilities, intimate relationships, and peer associations. These findings help illuminate the natural evolution of cannabis use and can guide the development of interventions for high-frequency cannabis users in the future.

Gang Membership and Pathways to Maladaptive Parenting	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												A limited amount of research examines the short-term consequences of gang membership. Rarer, though, is the examination of more distal consequences of gang membership. This is unfortunate because it understates the true detrimental effect of gang membership across the life course, as well as the effects it may have on children of former gang members. Using data from the Rochester Youth Development Study, this work investigates the impact of gang membership in adolescence (ages 12-18) on a particularly problematic style of parenting, child maltreatment. Using discrete time survival analysis, this study finds that gang membership increases the likelihood of child maltreatment and this relationship is mediated by the more proximal outcomes of gang membership during adolescence, precocious transitions to adulthood.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2014	24	2			SI		252	267		10.1111/jora.12110	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12110								24883000					WOS:000337571500005

Examining Appearance-Based Rejection Sensitivity During Early Adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The present study of 150 adolescents (M age=13.05years) examined the associations between appearance-based rejection sensitivity (Appearance-RS) and psychological adjustment during early adolescence, and evaluated three types of other-gender peer experiences (other-gender friendship, peer acceptance, and romantic relationships) as moderators. Appearance-RS was found to be uniquely related to two types of social anxiety, but not to self-esteem. Other-gender friendship emerged as a protective factor, whereas high other-gender peer acceptance emerged as a risk factor (especially for boys), after controlling for same-gender mutual best friendship involvement and peer acceptance. Results highlight the importance of distinguishing between different types of other-gender peer experiences during early adolescence and suggest that Appearance-RS during adolescence warrants further investigation.

The trial included a 1-week intervention program that focused on enhancing employment preparedness. In this trial, 416 graduates of secondary vocational institutes were randomized into a control and experimental group. All the study participants were assessed at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and 10 months later. The results showed that the School-to-Work intervention increased employment preparedness, which in turn increased employment at the 10-month follow-up. Furthermore, employment predicted work-life-related personal goals and lower financial strain, which in turn was associated with lower depressive symptoms.

Trajectories of Sexual Risk From Middle Adolescence to Early Adulthood	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Developmental trajectories of risky sexual behavior were identified in a multiethnic sample of 1,121 youth drawn from the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data set (NLSY79). Group-based trajectory modeling of a composite index of sexual risk taking revealed four sexual risk groups from ages 16 to 22: low risk, decreasing risk, increasing risk, and high risk. The Low Risk group exhibited low levels of risk across the study period. The Decreasing Risk group had high levels of sexual risk in adolescence that declined in early adulthood. The Increasing Risk and High Risk groups showed distinct risk patterns during adolescence but converged in early adulthood. When compared with adolescents in the low-risk group, individuals in the other groups were more likely to be male, had mothers who had an early birth, were less likely to live with both biological parents in early adolescence, had higher risk proneness, and reported more negative peer pressure.

Using a sample of 2,632 12- and 13-year-olds from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Child Survey we examine how childhood behavior and competence influence decision patterns in young adolescence. Individual models are used to test whether traits predict decision patterns, and sibling fixed-effects models allow us to estim backslash ate effects of child characteristics net of stable family contributions. In both individual and sibling fixed-effects models, children with higher verbal ability share more decision making with parents. Children with greater mathematical aptitude and children who are impulsive are more likely to make decisions without consulting parents. The impulsivity effect is stronger in families with fewer resources. These results suggest that children directly and indirectly influence household decision-sharing patterns.

Using a nationally representative sample of 5,487 black, white, and Hispanic adolescent females, this study examined associations among body mass index, current romantic involvement, and dieting. For each one point increase in body mass-index (BMI), the probability of having a romantic relationship decreased by 6%. Further, involvement in a nonsexual romantic relationship-but not involvement in a sexual romantic relationship-was associated with a significant increase in the likelihood of dieting. Associations between relationship type and dieting did not vary by age, socioeconomic status, or race, but were stronger at higher BMIs. These findings confirm that weight has implications for romantic involvement, which is highly valued by adolescent girls, and that romantic relationships, in turn, are important contexts in which to consider psychological and behavioral accommodation to the physical changes of puberty.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2005	15	4					535	559		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2005.00110.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2005.00110.x													WOS:000233518500011
J	Cleveland, HH				Cleveland, HH			Disadvantaged neighborhoods and adolescent aggression: Behavioral genetic evidence of contextual effects	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study used behavioral genetic methods to examine differences in genetic and environmental influences on adolescent aggression across adequate and disadvantaged neighborhoods. Analyses used National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health data from 2,342 monozygotic twin, dizygotic twin, full-sibling, and half-sibling pairs classified into structurally adequate and disadvantaged neighborhoods according to Census data on the proportion of single-parent households with children, proportion of families in poverty, and unemployment levels in sibling pairs' block groups. Separately estimating genetic and environmental influences across adequate and disadvantaged neighborhoods revealed that although genetic influences are significant in both adequate and disadvantaged neighborhoods, shared environmental influences (e.g., family influences shared by siblings) were significant only among adolescents from disadvantaged neighborhoods. These results provide insight into differences in individual-level influences that contribute to adolescent aggression within these different types of neighborhoods. Significant shared environmental influences in disadvantaged neighborhoods suggest the importance of family processes is increased by neighborhood disadvantage.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2003	13	2					211	238		10.1111/1532-7795.1302004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1532-7795.1302004													WOS:000182900700004

Data were collected over a 4-year period beginning immediately after the transition to junior high school and encompassing the transition to high school. Cluster analysis identified three distinct, divergent trajectories of self-esteem change from early to middle adolescence: Consistently High (47%), Small Increase (37%), and Chronically Low (16%). Clusters differed significantly on peer and family relationships and on emotional tone in a pattern consistent with differences in level of self-esteem. The findings support previous research regarding covariates of self-esteem across school transitions and illustrate the variability of self-esteem among rural adolescents.																			1050-8392						1997	7	4					393	411		10.1207/s15327795jra0704_3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0704_3													WOS:A1997YA02100003
J	LAURSEN, B				LAURSEN, B			CONFLICT AND SOCIAL-INTERACTION IN ADOLESCENT RELATIONSHIPS	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Differences between adolescent relationships in self-reported patterns of daily conflict and social interaction were identified. High school sophomores and juniors completed questionnaires detailing perceptions of exchanges in various relationships from the previous school day. An average of 7.74 daily conflicts were reported. Conflict, defined in terms of interpersonal disagreement, was most frequent with mothers, followed by friends, romantic partners, siblings, fathers, and other adults and peers. Levels of social interaction did not account for relationship differences in conflict, as more social interaction was reported with peers than family members. Relationship differences also arose in topics of disagreement. Conflict with parents centered on responsibilities, school, and autonomy, whereas that with peers concerned friendship and heterosexuality. The results support claims that conflict is an integral component of adolescent close relationships, underscoring areas of mutual interdependence between participants that require integration of goals and behaviors.

The first study (N = 20 female subjects; age range: 15 to 25 years) presents the three categories of adolescent identity types produced with the self-construct models: connected, contracted, and expanded. The second study (N = 49 male and female subjects; age range: 10 to 17 years) verifies that the contracted and expanded categories are more typical of adolescents than of children or adults. Contracted models of adolescent identity do not contain active negative emotion. Both the connected and expanded models contain both negative and positive emotion, but the expanded models contain more negative. Within the identity constructs, there is an indication of emotional change accompanying identity change in adolescence.																			1050-8392						1994	4	4					503	518		10.1207/s15327795jra0404_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0404_4													WOS:A1994QL36700004

Longitudinal effects of peer victimization on adolescents' future educational and work expectations: Depressive symptoms as a mechanism	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Leveraging six waves of data, this study examined the effects of ninth-grade peer victimization on adolescents' future work and education expectations 2 years later, testing depressive symptoms as a mechanism. Participants (N = 388, Mage = 14.05; 61% female, 35% male, 3% non-binary, trans, or other gender; 46% White, 19% Black, 17% Asian, 6% AMENA, 6% Multiracial, 6% other race) completed surveys from ninth through 11th grade. Results indicated that adolescents who experienced more frequent relational, but not overt, peer victimization in ninth grade were subsequently more pessimistic about their educational and occupational prospects beyond high school; depressive symptoms mediated this link. The findings suggest that relational victimization and its psychological harm may undermine adolescents' confidence in achieving postsecondary success.

Moreover, we studied how bully subtypes differed from nonbullies with varying levels of victimization and peer status in academic and psychosocial adjustment. The study utilizes data from 10,689 adolescents (48.3% boys, mean age 14.7 years). Latent profile analysis identified three distinct subgroups of bullies: popular-liked bullies (13.5%), popular-rejected bully-victims (5.8%), and bully-victims (6.9%), and four groups on nonbullies. High-status bullies (popular-liked and popular-rejected) resembled nonbullies in many ways and had even lower social anxiety, whereas bully-victims were the most maladjusted group. Overall, popularity seems to protect adolescents from social anxiety, and victimization is related to internalizing problems. Results suggest that bullying, victimization, and peer status can be used to identify distinct subtypes of bullies.

J	Nalani, A; Yoshikawa, H; Way, N				Nalani, Andrew; Yoshikawa, Hirokazu; Way, Niobe			Question asking in active listening scale for early adolescents: Behavioral measure development and initial validation	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Relational theories of human development explain how stereotypes and their underlying ideologies thwart social connections that are fundamental for individuals to thrive, especially in early adolescence. Intervention research to address this crisis of connection is still emergent and active listening is one promising strategy to this end; however, its efficacy has not been examined in part because no validated measures of active listening for this population exist. This validation study is the first to examine whether the behavioral dimensions of one form of active listening can be captured using a coding scheme to assess adolescents' engagement in a live interviewing task (N = 293). Importantly, the measure was developed within the context of a theory-driven intervention to train adolescents in transformative curiosity and listening to enhance connection. Findings indicate that two dimensions underlie the measure as hypothesized, open-ended questions and follow-up questions, with acceptable internal consistency. The measure is sensitive to change in adolescents' questioning skills before and after the intervention. Further, asking follow-up questions was positively related to empathy and also predicted a respondent's perception of their interviewer as a good listener. The effect for asking open-ended questions was moderated by dyad-level tendencies to elicit disclosure from others. The current measure not only examines question asking as a more nuanced behavioral dimension of active listening than previous measures, it is also the first to do so among a sample of early adolescents. The measure will be useful in assessing active listening interventions' efficacy to address the crisis of connection.

We examined whether "whole-family" versus "youth-focused" restrictions differentially predict social media-related difficulties (procrastination and problematic use), and whether adolescents' impulsive social media behaviors moderated these relationships. Among 183 Chinese early adolescents (58.5% female), whole-family rules negatively predicted procrastination. Impulsivity moderated associations between rulemaking approaches and social media difficulties; youth-focused rules negatively predicted procrastination and problematic use for highly impulsive adolescents, while whole-family rules held no associations or predicted increased difficulties. For less impulsive adolescents, however, whole-family rules negatively predicted social media difficulties and youth-focused rules positively predicted problematic use. Results suggest that setting the implementation of screen rules should involve parental participation and consideration of individual differences.

Through analysis of semistructured interviews of 31 Latina high school wrestlers, we identified various developmental outcomes associated with their sport involvement. We apply a new epistemological approach to positive youth development within the context of sports development through the usage of extensive narratives of two of the girls. This study explores adolescent Latinas' involvement in high school wrestling, a sport that is widely male dominated yet rising in popularity.

Hostile home environment predicting early adolescent sexual harassment perpetration and potential school-related moderators	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Using family systems theory, this longitudinal study of middle school youth examined the effects of abuse, family conflict, and sibling aggression on sexual harassment perpetration (N = 1563; M-age 11.2, 51% boys; 39% Hispanic, 29% Black, and 19% White). Boys reported more sexual harassment than girls; perpetration increased for both. The association between a hostile home environment and sexual harassment perpetration was moderated by school experiences. School belonging buffered effects of hostile home environment on baseline sexual harassment perpetration for boys who experienced abuse and White adolescents with high sibling aggression. Academic grades moderated change in perpetration over time, but effects differed by sex and race. It is important to understand how early violence exposures relate to sexual violence perpetration during early adolescence.

In particular, sharing information with a greater depth of intimacy is thought to strengthen social bonds and thus support mental health. The current study investigated the value for different depths of self-disclosures to close others (mothers and best friends) during adolescence and its association with mental health and well-being. Fifty-four girls (11.0-15.9 years) completed a forced-choice monetary paradigm to assess value for self-disclosures and questionnaires on mental health. Participants significantly valued (i.e., forfeited monetary reward) for disclosures to both mothers and best friends, although intimate disclosures were more "costly" than superficial disclosures. Greater value for intimate self-disclosures to mothers was also associated with better mental health and well-being.

Thus, it is critical to understand how Latinx youth develop attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that challenge white supremacy-or anti-racist identities and behaviors-that actively disrupt racial oppression communities of color face as well as their own communities. In this paper, we review theoretical mechanisms by which Latinx youth may develop anti-racist identities and actions on behalf of their own ethnic/racial communities and other communities oppressed by white supremacy.

Great diversity is observed in their adaptation. This diversity has been studied during the past decade from different angles and intellectual traditions. However, the results are disconnected. In this paper, first, we present a resilience conceptual model for understanding immigrant youth adaptation. We argue that its concepts and principles allow us to best pull together what is known and discover what is still unknown. Together with narrower topic-specific conceptual models, it can guide the formulation of hypotheses regarding immigrant youth resilience. Second, we examine comparatively, through the lens of this conceptual model, results of a content analysis on the abstracts of studies on individual differences in immigrant youth adaptation, conducted during the past decade in North American and European countries.

In two studies-comparing fourth to sixth graders during lockdown with a similar sample in pre-pandemic times, and longitudinally examining the same sample of participants, twice-we found that overall, early adolescents' emotional state during lockdown was significantly worse than in normal times (before the pandemic). This decline was explained by the participants' ratings of their loneliness, which was linked to their social (virtual) connections during lockdown. Importantly, participants with fewer social connections (in the virtual world as well as in face-to-face interactions) were less willing to help a lonely peer-even though they experienced similar pangs of loneliness.

However, little research has examined whether ECA participation predicts delinquency among at-risk young men or considered how delinquent behavior, in turn, impacts ECA participation. This study examined extracurricular participation over three years in a sample of 1,216 justice-involved young men (M-age = 15.29). Approximately half of the sample participated in ECA each year. A cross-lagged panel model was used to examine the bidirectional association between ECA participation and two types of delinquency, school misconduct and criminal offending. The results suggest that ECA participation did not consistently predict subsequent delinquency. Rather, justice-involved young men who engaged in more delinquency were less likely to participate in ECAs.

Although rooted in Paulo Freire's work on critical consciousness, sociopolitical development models overlook a motivational attribute-curiosity-that Freire characterized as a catalyst of such development. This longitudinal study investigated the relationship between curiosity and two aspects of sociopolitical development (social analysis, societal involvement) in a sample of Black and Latinx adolescents (N = 659). Longitudinal growth models demonstrated positive growth in all constructs over 4-years of high school.

Bidirectional Relationships Between Parenting Processes and Deviance in a Sample of Inner-City African American Youth	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study assessed bidirectional relationships among supportive parenting (knowledge), negative parenting (permissiveness), and deviance in a sample (N=5,325) of poor, inner-city African American youth from the Mobile Youth Survey over 4years. Cross-lagged path analysis provided evidence of significant bidirectional paths among parenting processes (knowledge and permissiveness) and deviance over time.

W.; Cassidy, Jude			When Parents and Adolescents Disagree About Disagreeing: Observed Parent-Adolescent Communication Predicts Informant Discrepancies About Conflict	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Adolescence is accompanied by increased stress in the parent-adolescent relationship, which frequently results in conflict. Researchers often rely on self-reports to measure conflict, but these reports are frequently discrepant from one another. In two studies, we examined the extent to which communication observed during parent-adolescent discussions of conflict were associated with discrepancies in reports about conflict. We also examined links between informant depressive symptoms and discrepancies. Across studies, observed parent-adolescent conflict behaviors consistently predicted absolute discrepancies in reports of conflict. Informant depressive symptoms sometimes predicted directional discrepancies in reports. Results suggest that informant discrepancies about conflict may stem, in part, from a lack of open communication in the relationship.

Suicide Ideation and Attempts Among Adolescents Engaged in Risk Behaviors: A Latent Class Analysis	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study addressed gaps in the literature regarding how different profiles of adolescent risk behavior relate to suicide. Data came from the 2010 Minnesota Student Survey of 9th and 12th grade students. Latent class analysis derived a set of four classes reflecting unique patterns of eight behaviors: maladaptive dieting, prescription drug misuse, illegal drug use, marijuana use, problem drinking, risky sexual behavior, perpetration of interpersonal violence, and self-injury. A class demonstrating high engagement in all risk behaviors, and a class highest on self-injury and maladaptive dieting but low on several other risk behaviors, showed high risk for suicide. Practitioners should carefully monitor adolescents engaging in multiple risk behaviors for suicide, especially if self-injury and maladaptive dieting are present.

Mark			Marital Conflict and Emotional Insecurity Among Chinese Adolescents: Cultural Value Moderation	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Emotional security theory has received substantial empirical support in the literature. However, the applicability of this theory in diverse cultures is still unclear. This study examined emotional insecurity among Chinese adolescents (N = 315) and how social harmony values moderated the association between parental conflict tactics (233 mothers; 224 fathers) and adolescents' emotional insecurity. Results showed that emotional insecurity could be reliably measured among Chinese adolescents. Furthermore, a significant moderation showed that paternal conflict tactics were associated with adolescents' emotional insecurity only when they endorsed higher social harmony. In the maternal model, an overall association between maternal conflict tactics and adolescents' emotional insecurity was observed. The current findings enrich the literature on emotional security in diverse ecological contexts.						CHEUNG, Rebecca Y.

Ratified into law by the majority of the countries of the world, it is the first human rights treaty focusing specifically on the rights of individuals under 18 years of age. The rights described in the treaty, however, are often seen as more important for younger children than for adolescents. This policy statement reviews the germane research on the period of adolescence and affirms that the protections and entitlements in the CRC are as important for adolescents as for younger children. Recommendations for policy and research are included.

The researchers examined whether parents affect friendships across group boundaries by shaping the structural opportunities to establish out-group friends and their children's out-group attitudes. The results show that if parents have more out-group friends and if they consider it less important to maintain in-group traditions, their children have more out-group friends. Part of this relationship is mediated by children's out-group attitudes. Some evidence is found that the opportunity structure mediates the relationship between parental characteristics and adolescent out-group friendship.

Two 2-day transcripts collected 4months apart within the same academic year were microcoded for content. Results showed that most text message utterances were positive or neutral and that adolescents sent text messages primarily to peers and to romantic partners. Only a few sex differences emerged. Frequency of text messages containing negative talk positively predicted overall internalizing symptoms and anxious depression. Text messaging about sex was positively associated with overall internalizing and somatic complaints for girls, but not for boys.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				MAR	2015	25	1					101	117		10.1111/jora.12101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12101								25750494					WOS:000350125300012

Sibling relationship quality was measured through behavioral observation. Links between self-blame and anxiety were moderated by sibling relationship quality. In older siblings, positive behavior with a sibling was associated with an attenuated relation between self-blame and anxiety. A paradoxical moderating effect was found for negative interactions; for both younger and older siblings, a relation between self-blame and anxiety was weakened in the presence of sibling negativity. Results offered support for theorized benefits of sibling relationship quality in helping early adolescents adjust to conflict between parents.

Structural equation modeling and logistic regression analysis indicated that frequent users of sexually explicit websites were five times more likely to initiate sexual intercourse than nonusers. Pubertal status moderated this relationship: an increased likelihood to initiate sex was found among adolescents in an early pubertal stage who frequently viewed sexually explicit websites. However, a lower likelihood to initiate sex was found among adolescents in an advanced pubertal stage. The possibility of a reciprocal relationship was also examined but was not supported.					; Eggermont, Steven/G-5670-2010	Vandenbosch, Laura/0000-0001-6834-8386; Eggermont, Steven/0000-0003-0428-092X													1050-8392	1532-7795				DEC	2013	23	4					621	634		10.1111/jora.12008	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12008													WOS:000326945400004

(2) Are physically aggressive adolescents influential? and (3) Who is susceptible to influence from these friends? Using stochastic actor-based modeling, we tested our hypotheses using a sample of 480 adolescents (ages 11-13) who were followed across four assessments (fall and spring of 6th and 7th grade). After controlling for other factors that drive network and behavioral dynamics, we found that physically aggressive adolescents were attractive as friends, physically aggressive adolescents and girls were more likely to select physically aggressive friends, and peer-rejected adolescents were less likely to select physically aggressive friends. There was an overall peer influence effect, but gender and social status were not significant moderators of influence.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				SEP	2013	23	3			SI		437	449		10.1111/jora.12044	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12044								24068860					WOS:000327990000004

For both siblings, authoritative parenting was positively associated with youth disclosure and was negatively related to problem behavior, and coercive parenting was negatively associated with youth disclosure and was positively related to problem behavior. When the influence of older sibling problem behavior on younger sibling problem behavior was modeled, younger sibling disclosure accounted for the relationship of maternal parenting processes to problem behavior. Findings indicate the important role of sibling influence in the development of problem behavior, contextualizing the relative roles of maternal parenting and youth disclosure in the transmission of risk.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2012	22	1					65	79		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2011.00757.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2011.00757.x								23667299					WOS:000300680500007

In this study, structural equation modeling was used to test two hypothesized models for the prediction of each facet of PD. Hypotheses were proposed about the effects of callousness and attachment insecurity, and the mediating role of adherence to honor code (AHC), with respect to each PD facet. AHC was defined by the endorsement of honor culture attitudes. The sample included 136 adolescent boys from high- and low-level Israeli schools. The results supported the differentiation between two PD models. AHC mediated the prediction of hostility/suspiciousness by callousness and attachment insecurity. Age and attachment insecurity predicted anxiety/depression. However, AHC and callousness did not predict anxiety/depression.

Not only is the sheer number of studies incorporating diverse youth increasing, this research has penetrated many areas of the study of adolescence. Some of this research has attempted to recognize and also capture the contextual and/or sociocultural processes that may explain racial and ethnic diversity or differences among youth in the United States and other countries. Research examining sociocultural and contextual processes underlying racial and ethnic differences is especially evident in the areas of parenting and family socialization. A considerable amount of research on ethnic minority and immigrant youth has also been conducted on their ethnic identity and acculturation, including processes of ethnic identity development, discrimination experiences, and the role of ethnic identity and discrimination in relation to adolescents' well-being. The theoretical implications of this research will be addressed in terms of what we have learned from studying diverse youth and how this focus has contributed to our theories of adolescence.

Path analyses with 444 adolescents and their parents provided support for the model's generalizability. Specifically, mothers' and fathers' reports of economic status (i.e., income, financial, and job instability) were associated with parents' economic stress. Economic stress and economic status were related to parental depressive symptoms, which, in turn, were associated with more hostile and coercive parenting, less nurturing and involved parenting, and greater interparental hostility. Finally, mothers' hostile and coercive parenting was directly related to both adolescents' academic and sociobehavioral outcomes, whereas fathers' nurturing and involved parenting was related to academic but not sociobehavioral outcomes.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2010	20	1					1	12		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00629.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00629.x								20454605					WOS:000274701000001

In general, controlling for demographic factors, children's motivation, and the dependent variable measured 3 years earlier, breadth was positively associated with indicators of academic adjustment at 11th grade and at 1 year after high school. In addition, for the three academic outcomes (i.e., grades, educational expectations, and educational status) the nonlinear function was significant; at high levels of involvement the well-being of youth leveled off or declined slightly. In addition, breadth of participation at 11th grade predicted lower internalizing behavior, externalizing behavior, alcohol use, and marijuana use at 11th grade.

The TRAILS Study	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The relation between partying and antisocial behavior was investigated using a sample of Dutch early adolescents (T2: N=1,076; M age=13.52). Antisocial behavior was divided into rule-breaking and aggressive behavior. Using a goal-framing approach, it was argued that the relation of partying to antisocial behavior depends on the way the need to belong is realized. Girls, in early adolescence often physically more mature than boys, are likely to seek older and, thus, often more antisocial boys for partying. Unpopular adolescents are likely to be among themselves when partying, and their feeling of exclusion is likely to lead to antisocial behavior. The findings show that girls who party are indeed at a greater risk of engaging in antisocial behavior, as are unpopular girls and boys.

Perceived racial discrimination and self-esteem in African American youth: Racial socialization as a protective factor	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Racial socialization was examined as a protective factor that might buffer African American youth from the negative effects of perceived racial discrimination. Two types of racial socialization were examined: messages about race pride and preparation for bias. One hundred twenty-eight eighth-grade African American students participated in the study. As anticipated, both types of socialization moderated the relationship between discrimination and self-esteem. The negative relationship between perceived discrimination and self-esteem was mitigated for youth who reported more messages about race pride and a moderate amount of preparation for bias from their parents. In contrast, low race pride socialization and both high and low preparation for bias were associated with a negative relationship between perceived discrimination and self-esteem.

For both sexes, measures of students' sense of affirmation and belonging to their ethnic heritage emerged as a strong predictor of positive psychosocial functioning. Less-consistent patterns of association emerged between other measures of ethnic identity and psychosocial adjustment. Students with achieved ethnic identity status, characterized by high levels of exploration of their ethnic heritage and high levels of affirmation or commitment to their Navajo culture, reported the most positive functioning on several measures.

This study investigated daily mood in Dutch 7th graders, aged 11-14. Cluster analysis of problem measures distinguished high-risk (n=25) and low-risk (n=106) subgroups. Participants completed experience-sampling reports of mood, social context, and location nine times daily for 5 days. Multilevel regression analyses of four mood measures confirmed higher anxiety and depressed mood in the high-risk group. Moods varied by location and social context, with significant differences between groups in two specific social contexts. First, when with family, low-risk adolescents felt less depressed than when alone, whereas high-risk adolescents felt more depressed. Second, high-risk adolescents showed more pronounced anxiety in social situations outside the network of family and friends. These findings point to everyday social contexts in which young adolescents with emotional and behavioral problems appear to be particularly vulnerable.

Racial discrimination was associated with lower levels of psychological functioning as measured by perceived stress, depressive symptomatology, and psychological well-being. Although individuals who believe that other groups hold more negative attitudes toward African Americans (low public regard) were at greater risk for experiencing racial discrimination, low public regard beliefs also buffered the impact of racial discrimination on psychological functioning. More positive attitudes about African Americans were also associated with more positive psychological functioning. The results further illustrate the utility of a multidimensional framework for understanding the role of racial identity in the relationship between racial discrimination and psychological outcomes among African American adolescents.																			1050-8392						2006	16	2					187	216		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2006.00128.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2006.00128.x													WOS:000236942900002

The sample consisted of 305 African American families living in inner city neighborhoods. Of the families, 40% were living at or below the U.S. poverty threshold. The primary caregiver and a focal adolescent (mean age 13.5 years) were interviewed separately in each family. The results indicated that the income-to-need ratio was significantly related to financial strain and neighborhood stress, both of which were positively associated with psychological distress in parents. Parent psychological distress was positively related to more negative and less positive parent-adolescent relations, which predicted a lower positive and higher negative adjustment in adolescents. The results extend previous findings by demonstrating that neighborhood characteristics are an important mediator between economic hardship and parent and adolescent behaviors.

J	Wadsworth, ME; Compas, BE				Wadsworth, ME; Compas, BE			Coping with family conflict and economic strain: The adolescent perspective	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study tested two models of family economic problems and adolescent psychological adjustment. Using adolescents' survey data and information regarding school lunch program enrollment, the associations among family SES, perceived economic strain, family conflict, and coping responses were examined in a sample of 364 adolescents from rural New England. Two theoretical models were tested using structural equation modeling-one tested coping as a mediator of the stress-psychopathology relation and the other tested coping as a moderator. Results revealed that family economic hardship was related to aggression and anxiety/depression primarily through two proximal stressors: perceived economic strain and conflict among family members. Family conflict partially mediated the relation between economic strain and adolescent adjustment, and coping further mediated the relation between family conflict and adjustment. These analyses identified two types of coping that were associated with fewer anxiety/depression and aggression problems in the face of these stressors-primary and secondary control coping. Although primary and secondary control coping were associated with fewer adjustment problems, youth who were experiencing higher amounts of stress tended to use less of these potentially helpful coping strategies and used more of the potentially detrimental disengagement coping. The models did not differ according to the age or gender of the adolescents, nor whether they lived with two parents or fewer. No support was found for coping as a moderator of stress. Implications of these findings and suggestions for future research involving coping with economic stressors are reviewed.

Participants included 417 students at community, public, and private colleges in Northern California who had been in a romantic relationship. Results indicate that although acceptance of betrayal is extremely low, the incidence of betrayal is nevertheless quite high, occurring in more than one third of the sample. The acceptance of betrayal varied with the circumstances under which betrayal occurred. Betrayal was more acceptable in a bad relationship or when there was a magnetic attraction to a new partner than when the perpetrators were being vindictive or were certain they would not get caught. Betrayal behavior was significantly correlated with sexual and intimacy variables including attitudes to betrayal, sexual permissiveness, early onset of sexual activity, and an avoidant relationship style. Male participants were more likely than female participants to be accepting of betrayal, but gender differences in the actual incidence of betrayal were not observed. This study illustrates that acts of betrayal are not as haphazard as they appear, because attitudes and personality characteristics are significant correlates of betrayal behavior.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					1999	9	3					227	252		10.1207/s15327795jra0901_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0901_2													WOS:000082363900001
J	Hauser, ST				Hauser, ST			Understanding resilient outcomes: Adolescent lives across time and generations	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Described is a new direction we are taking within our long-term longitudinal study of high and low risk adolescents. Through new questions and analytical approaches, we are addressing unexpected young adult outcomes: successful developmental adaptation despite serious prior risks and adversity. Our overarching goal here is gaining more complete understanding of how resilient development unfolds. Using a person-based follow-back design, we examine-through narrative analyses-previously recorded annual adolescent interviews with competent young adults who experienced significant misfortunes during their early and middle adolescent years. After briefly reviewing alternative ways of studying resilience, 3 aspects of our resilience project are presented: (a) how we identify the "competent" young adults from our high-risk adolescent sample, (b) our method for analyzing personal narratives embedded within the many hours of each competent (and average) outcome participant's interviews, and (c) our first results-8 content and structural themes involving individual constructions of self and relationships. To illustrate these methods and preliminary findings, narratives of 1 resilient young adult are explored, stretching from her troubled adolescent years to her young adult years, as she now deals with new challenges of being a spouse and parent. Implications of our utilizing quantitative and narrative analyses are then considered to pursue daunting questions about how some individuals defy the odds. Nothing is so fascinating or complicated as a trajectory of a human life. We emerge partly programmed at birth, and we change with our experiences thereafter. Some of us finally blow apart in adulthood like long-fuse time bombs, while others grow to shine brightly like comets. Most of us have less spectacular careers, which are still hard to explain in hindsight, even to ourselves, and impossible to foresee in detail.																			1050-8392						1999	9	1					1	24		10.1207/s15327795jra0901_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0901_1													WOS:000078462000001

The sample was 13- to 15-year-old Zimbabwean adolescents residing in traditional extended families and modified extended families (N = 128). The instrument used in the investigation was the Network of Relationships Inventory. A repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance was conducted with sex (boys vs. girls) and type of extended family (modified vs. traditional) treated as between-group factors and type of relationship (mother, father, favorite other adult relative, teacher, best friend, and favorite sibling) as a within-subjects factor. Adolescents in traditional extended families perceived themselves as receiving higher levels of intimacy from their family and conflict/discipline from all members of their social network in comparison to their counterparts living in modified extended families. In contrast, participants in modified extended families rated nonfamily targets higher on intimacy and mother, father, other adult relative, and best friend higher on the support variate of reliable affection than did their counterparts. Although participants were embedded in extended families in their daily lives, mothers and fathers still had salient roles. Peers were of importance for intimacy and companionship. Extended families, regardless of type, provided extensive affect and instrumental support for adolescents within family settings.																			1050-8392						1997	7	2					153	172		10.1207/s15327795jra0702_3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0702_3													WOS:A1997WQ17300003
J	Harton, HC; Latane, B				Harton, HC; Latane, B			Social influence and adolescent lifestyle attitudes	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												In a 2-year panel study, children's and adolescents' (aged 9-15 years) approval of both healthy and deviant mature lifestyle attitudes such as holding afterschool jobs, smoking, and dating increased linearly with grade for both boys and girls. Boys approved of these activities more than did girls; however, girls' approval increased more rapidly. By eighth grade, gender differences in attitudes had almost vanished. Relative liking and respect for the other sex also increased from fourth grade to eighth grade, although children remained strongly gender biased in their reported interactions. Students with more mature attitudes were more popular with the other sex, but there was no relation between attitudes and same-sex popularity. These results support a social influence explanation of adolescent attitude development and suggest that simple same-age peer pressure is not sufficient to account for the development of mature attitudes.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					1997	7	2					197	220		10.1207/s15327795jra0702_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0702_5													WOS:A1997WQ17300005
J	Weinfield, NS; Ogawa, JR; Sroufe, LA				Weinfield, NS; Ogawa, JR; Sroufe, LA			Early attachment as a pathway to adolescent peer competence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Forty-one adolescents ages 15-16, a subset of participants from an ongoing longitudinal study, were observed and interviewed during a 2-day-long camp reunion. Early attachment information was available for all participants. Counselors rated them on several personal and interpersonal characteristics after the reunion, including social competence. The participants were also interviewed regarding their experience and their thoughts about friendships and romantic interests of themselves and other campers. The interviews were coded for the extent to which the adolescent was willing to discuss people and relationships during the interview and the degree to which the participants were aware of the patterns of interaction in the social network around them. Results show that concurrent interest in relationships is a stronger predictor of social competence for participants with anxious histories, although participants with secure histories are more socially competent overall. This may indicate that participants with anxious histories must put in the effort of being interested in relationships in order to achieve social competence, whereas the skills of social competence come more easily to secure participants, whether or not they are explicitly interested in relationships in the given context.

J	Yates, M; Youniss, J				Yates, M; Youniss, J			Community service and political-moral identity in adolescents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This article presents a theoretical framework for understanding how community service affords opportunities for stimulating identity development in adolescents. Drawing on Erikson's (1968) writings, which stressed the socio-historical component of identity, we used Luckmann's (1991) scheme for parsing narratives into levels of transcendent identification. The narratives came from reflective essays of 132 Black parochial high school juniors who worked at a soup kitchen for the homeless as part of a school-based community service program. The majority of essays written at Time 1 (57.8%) and Time 2 (62.5%) could be scored at levels designated from ''little'' to ''bigger'' levels, and students who made transcendent statements at Time 1 and Time 2 tended to make ''higher'' level statements at Time 2 (z = 2.07, p < .05), thus suggesting developmental change. The results support the view that service experience can stimulate reflection on society's political organization and moral order.																			1050-8392						1996	6	3					271	284																WOS:A1996UZ37100002

Depressive symptoms are among the most frequently experienced psychological problems. However, little is known about the symptom-level interaction features of depressive symptoms and the roles of different symptoms across the junior high school stage. To address these gaps, this study conducted a three-year longitudinal study that recruited 1301 Chinese junior high school adolescents (48.2% females; mean age = 12.46 +/- 0.62, ranging from 11 to 14 in the first year). The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale was used to assess depressive symptoms. The regularized partial correlation network and the cross-lagged panel network models were used to explore the symptom-level interaction pattern. In regularized partial correlation networks, "I felt depressed" was a stable central symptom throughout the junior high school stage. Besides, "I felt lonely" and "I felt that people disliked me" were the other central symptoms in grade 7 and grade 8, and "I felt everything I did was an effort" played a central role in grade 9. Within cross-lagged panel networks, "I felt that people disliked me" and "I felt hopeless about the future" had important effects on predicting other depressive symptoms from grade 7 to 8 and from grade 8 to 9. By investigating the longitudinal interaction patterns of depressive symptoms among junior high school adolescents, the current study identifies core symptoms that could be potential prevention or intervention targets and provides a novel insight for understanding depressive symptoms during adolescence in depth.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				2024 NOV 25	2024										10.1111/jora.13040	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.13040		NOV 2024						39582479					WOS:001362084600001

J	McLoughlin, S; Kristjánsson, K				McLoughlin, Shane; Kristjansson, Kristjan			Virtues as protective factors for adolescent mental health	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This paper explores the decline in adolescent mental health and the weakening of traditional moral frameworks, positing education in the virtues as protective of mental health due to the intrinsic link between moral/existential wellbeing and psychological health. By integrating character education into school curricula, a continuous "dosage" of moral guidance may be an optimal way to ensure a gradual and ever-clearer articulation of a life worth living and how to live well. The paper critiques popular clinical and positive psychological approaches to promoting wellbeing, which often miss the existential and moral dimensions of adolescent growth. The conclusion emphasizes the need for integrating moral education into mental health interventions to address the comprehensive existential and moral dimensions of adolescent development. This paper advocates for a proactive character developmental model that nurtures moral and existential growth, recognizing challenges with virtue and meta-virtue development as integral to personal and moral evolution, and enhancing the moral and psychological fortitude of adolescents.

Taking the long view of adolescent work quality	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Following Schulenberg's research on teenage employment and vocational development, we ask to what extent do job dimensions reflecting the quality of work experience during mid-adolescence (e.g., work stress, autonomy, learning and advancement opportunities, hourly pay, wage satisfaction, and work hours) predict the same work experiences during the ensuing occupational career? Using longitudinal data from the Youth Development Study (N = 711 individuals over 3164 occasions), and hybrid panel models to control for unobserved time-stable selection influences, we find a high level of continuity of work quality from adolescence to mid-life. Multiple dimensions of adolescent work quality are associated with the same dimensions of work quality in adulthood, even after controlling for educational attainment and other time-varying adult confounders.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				2024 FEB 10	2024										10.1111/jora.12915	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12915		FEB 2024						38339850					WOS:001159829500001

Participants included 571 children (M-age = 9.62 years) and 345 adolescents M-age = 12.12 years) in mainland China. Social withdrawal subtypes (i.e., shyness, unsociability, social avoidance) and indices of socio-emotional adjustment were assessed via self-reports, peer nominations, and teacher ratings. Shyness tended to be more strongly associated with emotional maladjustment in early adolescence, whereas unsociability was more strongly associated with socio-emotional difficulties in childhood. For social avoidance, associations with indices of negative adjustment (i.e., social anxiety, emotional symptoms, peer problems) were stronger in childhood, however, associations with indices of positive adjustment (i.e., life satisfaction, well-being) were stronger in early adolescence.

We explored how three dimensions of the classroom cultural diversity climate (critical consciousness, color-evasion, and multiculturalism) related to adolescents' critical reflection (i.e., perceived societal Islamophobia) and intended critical action (i.e., political activism). Our sample included adolescents experiencing high (second generation, Muslim, N = 237) versus low (non-immigrant descent, non-Muslim, N = 478) stigmatization in Germany. Multilevel analyses revealed that for both groups a critical consciousness climate, but not a color-evasive or a multicultural climate, was positively associated with perceived societal Islamophobia and intended critical action. Thus, to promote adolescents' critical consciousness, schools should go beyond emphasizing a common humanity and celebrating cultural diversity and include explicit discussions of social inequity.

Slow Life History Strategies and Increases in Externalizing and Internalizing Problems During the COVID-19 Pandemic	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The COVID-19 pandemic is but one of many instances of environmental adversities that have recurred in human history. Biobehavioral resource allocation strategies, known as fast (reproduction-focused) versus slow (development-focused) life history (LH) tradeoff strategies, evolved to deal with environmental challenges such as infectious diseases. Based on 141 young people and their mothers observed prior to (ages 9 and 13) and during (age 20) COVID-19, we investigated longitudinal relations involving slow LH strategies. The results support the adaptive role of slow LH strategies in reducing COVID-related increases in externalizing problems. In addition, the effect of early adversity on COVID-related increases in externalizing was mediated, and the effect on COVID-related increases in internalizing was moderated, by slow LH strategies.

SRA COVID-19 Response Team	Adolescence Amid a Pandemic: Short- and Long-Term Implications	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Members of the Society for Research on Adolescents COVID-19 Response Team offer this commentary to accompany this special issue of the Journal of Research on Adolescence regarding the impact of the pandemic on adolescents' social, emotional, and academic functioning. In addition to outlining the critical need for scholarly collaboration to address the global impact of this crisis on adolescent development, we argue that a broad investigative lens is needed to guide research and recovery efforts targeting youth development. We then use this broad lens to consider dimensions of the pandemic impact relative to developmental implications within community and policy contexts, educational contexts, social contexts, and family contexts. Finally, we describe guideposts for setting a global, shared research agenda that can hasten research to recovery efforts surrounding the pandemic and youth development.

Does Adolescent Digital Technology Use Detract from the Parent-Adolescent Relationship?	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												A population-representative sample of young adolescents (N = 2,104, mean age 12.4) reported on digital technology use and relationships in 2015. A subsample (N = 388) completed a 14-day ecological momentary assessment in 2016-2017 via mobile phone. Across the 2,104 adolescents, those who reported more social networking site engagement were more likely to live in families characterized by more family chaos and to report that their online experiences resulted in problems with their parents. However, when the subsample of adolescents was followed daily, there was little consistent evidence that adolescents' quantity of daily digital technology use detracted from the amount of time they spend interacting with close others (including parents) nor that adolescent daily technology use was associated with more negative or less positive parent-adolescent interactions.

The participants (ages 9 to 11) were 240 pre- and young adolescents (114 boys, 126 girls) involved in 120 same-sex best friendships that were stable across a period of 4 to 12 weeks. Each friend described perceptions of negativity in their relationship. Prosocial behavior and relational aggression were assessed via peer nominations. Dyadic analyses indicated that one friend's prosocial behavior and relational aggression uniquely forecast changes in the other friend's perception of negativity in the relationship. Greater initial levels of prosocial behavior anticipated decreases in perceived negativity, whereas greater initial levels of relational aggression forecast increases in perceived negativity.

Participants were 270 young adolescents (52% boys; M-age = 11.84 years) who completed peer nomination and self-report measures as part of a 7-month longitudinal study (Wave 1; Feb. Grade 6; Wave 2: May, Grade 6; Wave 3: Sept., Grade 7). Cross-lagged autoregressive path models revealed reciprocal associations between positive peer treatment and prosocial behavior, such that Wave 1 positive peer treatment predicted increases in Wave 2 prosocial behavior and vice versa. Findings are novel, highlight the importance of considering positive peer treatment during adolescence, and set the stage for future work in this area.

A Latent Variable Approach to Measuring Social Dynamics in Adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												In the study of adolescent health, it is useful to derive indices of social dynamics from sociometric data, and to use these indices as predictors of health risk behaviors. In this manuscript, we introduce a flexible latent variable model as a novel way of obtaining estimates of social integration and social status from school-based sociometric data. Such scores provide the flexibility of a regression-based approach while accounting for measurement error in sociometric indicators. We demonstrate the utility of these factor scores in testing complex hypotheses through a combination of structural equation modeling and survival models, showing that deviance mediates the relationship between social status and smoking onset hazard at the transition to high school.

Longitudinal Patterns in Parent and Friend Emotion Socialization: Associations With Adolescent Emotion Regulation	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Adolescents learn about emotions through interacting with parents and friends, though there is limited longitudinal research on this topic. This study examined longitudinal patterns in parent and friend emotion socialization and adolescent emotion regulation. Eighty-seven adolescents reported on parent and friend emotion socialization. Parents reported on adolescent emotion regulation. Parents' responses were stable over time and across gender. Friends of girls reciprocated negative emotions more and were less punitive over time, whereas friends of boys increased in comforting and decreased in neglect of negative emotions. Parents and friends evidenced unique effects on adolescent emotion regulation, and the effect of friend socialization responses differed for girls and boys. Future research should examine combinatory influences of multiple socializers on adolescent adjustment.

Participants were 855 high school students who completed self-report measures at three time points, with a 1-year interval between them. SIP did not act as a mediator, but the emergence of anger emotions in dating conflict situations, along with aggression-justifying beliefs, were revealed as essential in explaining dating violence. Previous aggression also explained a subsequent higher anticipation of positive consequences for aggressive acts. We discuss the implications for prevention and treatment strategies with adolescents.

Participants (N=66, M-age=16.38, 73% European American) were interviewed about hypothetical situations describing adolescents who defied parental directives and lied about their defiance. Judgments about the legitimacy of parents' directives and protagonists' deception differed by types of parent relationship with adolescents (mutual or unilateral). Directives were least accepted, and deception was most accepted, in the context of unilateral relationships. Judgments also differed by domain of the action (personal, prudential, or conventional). Participants were least accepting of parental directives, and most accepting of deception about personal activities. Findings indicate that adolescents value honesty and parental authority, but sometimes give priority to concerns with autonomy and mutuality.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				DEC	2017	27	4					862	877		10.1111/jora.12319	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12319								29152872					WOS:000415897400010

Long-Term Effects of Fathers' Depressed Mood on Youth Internalizing Symptoms in Early Adulthood	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												While an accumulating body of research has documented increased risk of psychopathology among children of depressed fathers, most studies have used cross-sectional design, and little is known about offspring outcomes beyond childhood. Using prospective data from a community sample (N=395), we found that paternal depressive symptoms when children were in early adolescence (age 13) predicted offspring depressive and anxiety symptoms at age 21, controlling for baseline youth symptoms, maternal depressive symptoms, and other known correlates of internalizing problems in early adulthood. Associations were not moderated by maternal depressive symptoms or child gender. These results suggest that the unique and long-term effects of paternal depression on children's risk of mood disorders may persist into adulthood.

Adolescent Pathways to Co-Occurring Problem Behavior: The Effects of Peer Delinquency and Peer Substance Use	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Delinquency and substance use are more likely to co-occur in adolescence compared to earlier and later developmental periods. The present study examined developmental pathways to co-occurring problem behavior from 6th to 10th grade (N=2,002), testing how peer delinquency and substance use were linked to transitioning between abstaining, delinquency, substance use, and co-occurring problem behavior. Developmentally, most youth transition from abstinence to delinquent behavior and then escalate to co-occurring problem behavior. Once co-occurring problem behavior onsets, remitting to single-problem behavior or abstinence is unlikely. The impact of peers on problem behavior is domain-specific when individuals transition from abstaining to a single-problem behavior, but is more general with respect to escalation of and desistance from problem behavior.

Selection and Influence Mechanisms Associated With Marijuana Initiation and Use in Adolescent Friendship Networks	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Friends are thought to influence adolescent drug use. However, few studies have examined the role of drugs in friendship selection, which is necessary to draw sound conclusions about influence. This study applied statistical models for social networks to test the contribution of selection and influence to associations in marijuana use among friends in two large high schools (N=1,612; M age=16.4). There was evidence for friend selection based on similar lifetime and current marijuana use at both schools, but friends were found to influence the initiation and frequency of adolescent marijuana use in just one of these schools.

Results showed youth in the three contexts were similar on romantic desire. Yet those in increasingly Westernized contexts reported more romantic activities and greater perceived autonomy from parents in partner choice. They were also more likely to consume Western and social media, and possess friends fostering permissive expectations, greater cross-sex network composition, and intimate communication. Involvement with the global media and friends explained the link between the cultural spectrum and romantic experiences.

J	Meeus, W				Meeus, Wim			The Study of Adolescent Identity Formation 2000-2010: A Review of Longitudinal Research	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Longitudinal research into personal and ethnic identity has expanded considerably in the first decade of the present century. The longitudinal studies have shown that personal identity develops progressively during adolescence, but also that many individuals do not change identity, especially ethnic identity. Researchers have found rank-order stability of personal identity to be larger in adulthood than in adolescence and stability of ethnic identity to be larger in middle and late than early adolescence. Personal identity appears to progress in adulthood, as well. Adolescents with a mature identity typically show high levels of adjustment and a positive personality profile, live in warm families, and perform well at school. There is little evidence for developmental order, however, and studies instead have mainly found covariation over time between identity and the other developmental processes. The present review demonstrates that the dimensional approach to the study of identity formation can be very successful. It allows for combined variable and person-centered analyses, and for empirically generated and replicable statuses. Theoretically, the review suggests that identity formation is a less dynamic process than commonly assumed, that the identity status continuum has the order diffusion (D)-> moratorium (M)-> foreclosure (F)-> achievement (A), that adolescents may follow two distinct sets of identity transitions on this continuum: D -> F (or EC: early closure, an alternative label for foreclosure)-> A or D -> M -> C (closure, a subtype of early closure)-> A, that present identity status research offers multiple ways to study continuity of identity, and that there is no empirical proof for the assumption that exploration precedes commitment in the process of identity formation. Additionally, narrative identity research became highly visible between 2000 and 2010. The studies into narrative identity have shown that continuity of identity and coherence of the life story both grow in adolescence. Suggestions for future research are outlined.

The study included 378 adolescents (196 females and 182 males) from high schools with different socioeconomic status (SES) who were administered Relationship Scale Questionnaires and Offer Self-Image Questionnaires. The findings indicate that adolescents from a low SES had significantly low scores on self-image scales compared with those from high and middle SES. It was found that secure attachment patterns affect social relationships and superior adjustment aspects of self-image positively. The results of this study show that attachment patterns play an important role in the development of the self-image, which is a crucial psychological structure gained in adolescence.

Participants were 289 adolescents (150 females and 139 males, modal age 14) and both parents. Parental solicitation and control did not predict adolescent delinquency, but adolescents' self-reported disclosure was a negative predictor of delinquency. In addition, delinquency predicted less disclosure. Furthermore, maternal solicitation predicted disclosure and adolescent disclosure predicted parental solicitation. All relations held after controlling for leisure time spent with parents and with peers. These longitudinal findings show an overlap in the development of parental solicitation and the development of adolescent disclosure, but also show that only adolescent disclosure is negatively related to delinquency over time.

Developmental Characteristics of African American and Caribbean Black Adolescents' Attributions Regarding Discrimination	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The present study examined discrimination attributions in the psychological well-being of Black adolescents. Findings are based on a representative sample of 810 African American and 360 Caribbean Black youth, aged 13-17, who participated in the National Survey of American Life. Youth completed measures of perceived discrimination, discrimination attributions, depressive symptoms, self-esteem, and life satisfaction. Approximately half the youth attributed discrimination to race/ethnicity (43%), followed by age (17%), physical appearance (16.5%), and gender (7.5%), and there were no ethnic, gender, or age differences regarding discrimination attributions. Key findings suggest that the association between perceived discrimination and psychological well-being did not vary according to discrimination attribution, which implies that discrimination is harmful for Black youth regardless of the attribution.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2010	20	3					774	788		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00659.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00659.x								23966759					WOS:000280995500011

We were interested in the extent to which the relations of these behaviors with popularity were moderated by positive features (i.e., athletic abilities, physical attractiveness, and prosociality). From a goal-framing perspective, it was argued that positive features evoke positive affect, which in turn enhances the positive impact of aggressive, destructive, and norm-breaking behaviors on popularity. The results supported our notion that these latter behaviors are especially related to popularity in adolescents who also exhibit positive features.

JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This longitudinal study examined how adolescents' perceptions of attachment security with parents relate to their process of choosing a major in higher education. The participants were 281 students who were investigated at the beginning, middle, and end of Grade 12. Findings showed that higher perceived security with mother, but not with father, predicted higher levels of coping with the career decisional tasks of orientation, broad and in-depth environmental exploration, and self-exploration in the future. However, perceived security did not relate to the degree of change in decisional tasks during Grade 12. Finally, results suggested that the association between perceived security with mother and the decisional tasks of orientation, broad and in-depth environmental exploration, and self-exploration was mediated by adolescents' career decision-making self-efficacy.

Data from Rounds 1-5 of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1997 were used to examine hypotheses about the influence of the parent-adolescent relationship on subsequent adolescent mental well-being and delinquency, as mediated by family processes. Using structural equation modeling, we found that the influence of a positive residential parent-adolescent relationship on better mental well-being and fewer delinquency was entirely mediated by family routines, parental monitoring, and parental supportiveness, net of sociodemographic controls.

In this study, 24 middle-class two-parent families narrated a shared negative experience together and we examined the process (initiations and collaborations) and function (the expression and explanation of emotions) of co-constructed narratives in relation to preadolescents' perceived competencies and self-esteem. Family narratives in which specific emotions were expressed and explained in a collaborative fashion, especially negative emotion, were positively related to preadolescents' reported competencies and self-esteem, whereas family narratives that expressed general positive emotion were negatively related to preadolescents' perceived competencies. Implications of family narratives about emotional events, specifically the ways in which families discuss emotion, in relation to preadolescents' self-development are discussed.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2008	18	3					573	593		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2008.00572.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2008.00572.x													WOS:000258380200008

"Outcome Expectancies" are evaluative social cognitions about what will occur as a consequence of one's actions. Risk behaviors and outcome expectancies for substance use, sexual behavior, and delinquency were assessed. In all regression models, positive expectancies were significantly related to risk behaviors while negative expectancies, with one exception, were not significantly related. In three of four regression models, significant interactions were found between positive and negative expectancies in predicting risk behaviors. The nature of the interaction differed by type of risk behavior. Beyond demonstrating associations between outcome expectancies and risk behaviors in a maltreated sample, this paper contributes to the study of social information processing by demonstrating significant interactions between positive and negative expectancies.

Each domain of young adult adjustment problems was assessed with three indicators (i.e., lifetime rates of psychiatric disorders, annual rates of psychiatric disorders, elevated levels of problem behaviors). Findings indicated specificity in trajectory-outcome associations, with all active offender pathway groups consistently showing poorer adjustment in the domains of young adult alcohol and illicit drug use (but not depression) relative to the rare offenders. However, there was almost no evidence of differential outcomes among the four most active offender trajectory groups. Overall, this study offered limited support for the contention that differing developmental courses and experiences during middle adolescence are linked to differential outcomes in early adulthood.

Drawing on reports from diverse regions of the world, this article describes the range of adolescent experiences as they encompass the completion of school and the commencement of adult work. As the 21st century begins, major threats to the preparation of youth for adult work include deficiencies in schools, hazards of the informal work sector, a lack of clear connections between school and work, and the misuse or underutilization of technology. Yet this transition is also a story of optimism, as the significance of youth for economic and social development is increasingly appreciated at the national and international levels. Accordingly, this article considers the broad policy implications of the survey and then details the lines of action that address challenges to the preparation of youth for adult work. Although many regions of the world share common challenges, the integration of youth into the 21st century world of work will depend on how each country formulates a unique response that is sensitive to its demographic profile, social institutions, cultural heritage, and economic conditions.																			1050-8392						2002	12	1					99	120		10.1111/1532-7795.00026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1532-7795.00026													WOS:000174232000005

Using semistructured interviews, parents were queried about two developmentally salient issues of early adolescence: parental limit-setting and adolescent independence. Parents primarily defined firm Limits in terms of nonnegotiation, strongly endorsed setting firm limits regarding a range of issues, and justified the importance of limits by focusing on adolescents' socialization and psychological development. Mothers rated limiting adolescents' behavior as more important than permitting or encouraging adolescents' independence. Limits were seen as more important by mothers of younger rather than older early adolescent females, but mothers encouraged independence more for younger rather than older early adolescent males. Mothers permitted independent decisions regarding a limited range of issues such as clothes and appearance, based on psychological concerns with adolescents' developing autonomy and competence; they encouraged independence primarily by encouraging greater responsibility. The results demonstrate that there is considerable heterogeneity in African American parents' beliefs and goals about parenting in early adolescence.

In addition, the linkage between the quality of relationships with parents and peers, and affective intensity with a romantic partner was investigated. Interviews were held with 168 Israeli adolescents, who also completed questionnaires assessing romantic behaviors, romantic perceptions, and quality of relationships with their romantic partner, parents, and a same-gender close friend. Older adolescents were more likely than younger adolescents to have a romantic partner. Romantic perceptions pertaining to companionship and excitement were less frequent among older adolescents. However, aspects such as intimacy and level of emotional involvement were similar across adolescence. Girls emphasized more attachment and care in their romantic relationships than boys. In addition, adolescents who were currently dating perceived romantic relationships more in terms of emotional involvement than adolescents who were not dating. The affective intensity with same-gender close friend but not with parents was linked to the affective intensity with the romantic partner.

In-depth interviews were carried out with 60 American-born Japanese-American, African-American, and Mexican-American high-school students, aged 16 to 18 years, and one parent of each adolescent. There were significant ethnic group differences in parental ethnic socialization, with African-American parents more frequently reporting discussing prejudice with their child and Japanese-American and African-American parents emphasizing adaptation to society more than Mexican-American parents. Adolescent use of a proactive style of coping with stereotypes and discrimination was associated with higher self-esteem, and use of verbal retorts was related to lower self-esteem.

J	Kara, B; Selcuk, B				Kara, Buket; Selcuk, Bilge			The role of cumulative risk and armed conflict exposure in adolescent psychological symptoms in Turkey	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Exposure to risk factors and adversity may cause immediate, and sometimes prolonged, psychological symptoms in adolescents. Identifying universal and specific risk factors in a particular context and examining their cumulative effects is crucial for understanding the mechanisms underlying psychological symptoms and informing about strategies for intervention. Using concurrent measures, the current study aimed to examine the role of armed conflict experiences and cumulation of other risk factors (e.g., maternal psychological symptoms, socioeconomic indicators) in predicting adolescent psychological symptoms in an underresearched community. The sample included 161 adolescents (54.7% female) aged 11-14 years (M = 12.36, SD = 1.27) and their mothers living in the east of Turkey. The cumulative risk index was calculated by summing the standardized scores of the corresponding factors. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to predict internalizing and externalizing symptoms among adolescents by introducing demographic variables (age, gender) in the first step, armed conflict experiences and cumulative risk in the second step, and their interaction in the final step. Results showed that the levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms were predicted by gender, armed conflict experience and cumulative risk. Being a girl was associated with higher levels of internalizing symptoms and lower levels of externalizing symptoms. Higher levels of internalizing and externalizing symptoms were predicted by exposure to armed and cumulative risk. After controlling for other factors, the interaction of armed conflict experience and cumulative risk significantly predicted externalizing, but not internalizing symptoms. These findings suggested that cumulative risk was a stronger predictor of psychological symptoms, and further amplified the strength of the association between armed conflict experiences and externalizing symptoms. These findings can be used in the formulation of intervention strategies and policies to promote psychological well-being in adolescents living in armed conflict zones under multiple risks.

JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Antisocial and illegal behavior generally declines as youth approach adulthood, but there is significant individual variation in the timing of the peak and decline of offending from adolescence to young adulthood. There are two primary research questions in the present study. First, are there subgroups of youth who follow similar patterns of offending over the nine years after their first arrest? Second, what baseline factors predict which youth will follow each pattern of offending? Data were drawn from the Crossroads study, which includes a sample of racially and ethnically diverse boys who were interviewed regularly for 9 years following their first arrest. Boys were between 13 and 17 years old at the start of the study and were approximately 24-25 years old at the final interview. Trajectories were measured with youths' self-reported offending using latent class growth analysis (LCGA). Results indicated that there were four subgroups of youth: a stable low group (55%), an escalating group (23%), a short-term recidivist group (15%), and a persistently high group (7%). Several baseline factors distinguished the groups. In particular, the results indicated that youth who were informally processed after their first arrest were more likely to be in the low offending group than any of the other LCGA groups. Age at first arrest, peer delinquency, exposure to violence, substance use, callous-unemotional traits, physical aggression, and perceptions of police legitimacy were also significantly related to group membership. Results suggest that certain risk factors identified after youths' first arrest may predict which youth continue to offend and which desist.

J	Guo, SY; Liu, JX; Pak, A				Guo, Siying; Liu, Jianxuan; Pak, Anna			Examining the causal effects of exposure to violence on crime among youth involved in the justice system: Experienced, witnessed, and experienced-witnessed violence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Previous studies on exposure to violence lack a nuanced understanding of the causal effects of different exposure types on offending behaviors. This study, drawing on Pathways to Desistance Study (PDS) data tracking 1354 adjudicated youths aged 14-18 over 7 years, explores the contemporaneous (cross-sectional), acute (after 1 year), enduring (after 3 years), and long-term (after 6 years) causal effects of violence exposure on property and violent offending. The sample, predominantly male (86%), consisted of White (20%), Black (42%), and other (38%) individuals. The generalized propensity score is used to match unbalanced covariates across multiple exposure types, namely noninvolved (n = 392), witnessed (n = 577), experienced (n = 31), and experienced-witnessed violence (n = 305). Results demonstrate the contemporaneous, acute, enduring, and long-term effects of violence exposure on both violent and property offending, with varying durations and strengths across exposure types. The most pronounced risk effects are immediate, diminishing over time and potentially reversing in the long term as youth transition into adulthood. Among exposure types, experienced-witnessed violence exhibits the most potent effects on offending, followed by witnessed violence and then experienced violence-a pattern consistent across the observed time points. Noteworthy is the finding that the impact of violence exposure is more pronounced for violent offending, diminishing more rapidly compared to the effects on property offending.

The protective effects of strong bicultural (ethnic and national) identities and the detrimental effects of ethnic discrimination on adjustment outcomes are well documented for ethnic minority youth in W.E.I.R.D. societies. Yet, ethnic minority youth in non-W.E.I.R.D. societies, such as Korean Chinese, may experience a unique form of discrimination-national discrimination. It is not known how multiple social identities and experiences of dual discrimination may intersect to predict youth adjustment. Thus, this study explored profiles of ethnic and national identities and ethnic and national discrimination among Korean Chinese youth and examined their psychological, health, and academic adjustment. The analytic sample included 267 Korean Chinese youth aged from 12 to 18 (M = 15.21, SD = 1.65) residing in Northeast China. Three latent profiles were identified. The dominant profile of Korean Chinese youth was characterized by high bicultural identity and low ethnic and national discrimination (BILD; n = 171). The second profile was characterized by high bicultural identity and high national discrimination (BIND, n = 50). The third profile was characterized by moderate ethnic and national identities and moderate ethnic and national discrimination (MIMD, n = 46). Regression analyses found that the BILD profile showed fewer depressive symptoms compared to the BIND profile and showed better perceived physical health compared to the MIMD profile. The findings highlight strong bicultural identities as a cultural asset and discrimination-particularly national discrimination-as a contextual risk to Korean Chinese adolescents' well-being.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2024	34	2			SI		313	326		10.1111/jora.12907	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12907		DEC 2023						38069530					WOS:001116960400001

Examining area- and individual-level differences in suicide ideation severity and suicide attempt among youth	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Youth suicide is a pressing problem and suicide rates are not equally distributed across geographic areas or socioeconomic status (SES). Death by suicide is often preceded factors including hopelessness and suicide ideation, planning, and attempt. The current study examined area- and individual-level differences in suicide ideation severity and suicide attempt in a state-representative sample of youth from 2019 (N = 78,740) and 2021 (N = 61,396). Youth from higher SES and rural areas showed lower suicide ideation severity and odds of suicide attempt. After including individual-level covariates, SES differences in ideation severity and suicide attempt persisted for 2019 but not 2021. Rural differences for ideation severity persisted across years but not for suicide attempt. Further research on geographic variation in suicide risk is needed.

Study 1 identified five important adult criteria among 763 participants (M-age = 23.13; 54.8% girls) through exploratory factor analysis. In Study 2, 616 participants (M-age = 22.51; 71.6% girls) completed measures of parental autonomy support (PAS) and psychological control (PPC), subjective adult status, and adult criteria. Results showed that PAS was positively associated with subjective adult status and endorsement of almost all adult criteria, whereas PPC was both positively and negatively associated with different adult criteria. Findings reveal the influence of family factors on youth transition to adulthood in the Chinese context and may have implications for family based interventions.

The growth mixture model identified four trajectories of PYD, labeled high start-fast decreasing, high start-low decreasing, low start-low increasing, and mid-persistent. Results also showed that membership in a PYD trajectory is significantly related to three promotive factors: parental involvement, teacher involvement, and intentional self-regulation. These findings have important theoretical and practical insights for a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of positive development in adolescents following the critical period surrounding the transition to high school.

A community sample of adolescents (10-17 years, n = 1327) completed the Children's Depression Inventory and the Revised Family Communication Pattern Instrument. Depressive symptoms were also re-assessed 6 months later. Results showed that Conversation orientation protected against, whereas Conformity orientation increased the risk of adolescent depression. Family communication particularly influenced the child's feeling of being unloved, and feeling unloved was the only symptom prospectively predicted by two communication orientations at baseline. These findings revealed the path linking family factors to adolescent depression and may have implications for future family-based interventions.

What is less clear is how Black families discuss ethnicity-race and social inequalities with pubescent children. We examined associations between pubertal timing and ethnic-racial socialization among mothers (M-age = 42) of Black (n = 286) and Black-White biracial (n = 233) girls aged 9-12. Moderation by maternal stress about puberty was also examined. Results indicated mothers of Black girls who were stressed about puberty reported more preparation for bias; whereas both groups of mothers reported more cultural socialization. Early pubertal timing and high maternal stress about puberty predicted more cultural socialization among both groups and more egalitarian beliefs among only mothers of Black-White biracial girls. The findings highlight the importance of ethnic-racial socialization during puberty.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				MAR	2022	32	1			SI		99	114		10.1111/jora.12724	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12724		JAN 2022						35048453					WOS:000744329700001

Investigating Longitudinal Associations Between Racial Microaggressions, Coping, Racial/Ethnic Identity, and Mental Health in Black Girls and Women	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Racial microaggressions pose significant risk to health and well-being among Black adolescents and adults. Yet, protective factors (i.e., coping, racial/ethnic identity) can moderate the impact of racial microaggressions over time. Unfortunately, few studies have evaluated the role of these protective factors longitudinally or specifically among Black girls and women. In the current study, we focused on the experiences of Black girls and women and investigated the longitudinal links between racial microaggressions and mental health symptoms over 1 year. We then explored the role of two key protective factors as moderators-coping with racial discrimination and racial/ethnic identity-for mental health. Participants included 199 Black adolescent girls (M-age = 16.02) and 199 Black women (M-age = 42.82) who completed measures on two types of racial microaggressions, three types of coping strategies, racial/ethnic identity, and mental health symptomology. Girls and women completed measures at three time points over 1 year. Results indicated both types of microaggressions predicted increased mental health symptoms in Black women. Among Black girls, assumptions of criminality predicted increased externalizing symptoms only when protective factors were included in the model. Analysis of the protective factors indicated a potential direct benefit rather than a moderating role of coping with racial discrimination through positive thinking for mental health in both Black girls and women. Evidence suggests that coping may have had a direct rather than an indirect effect on Black girls' mental health over time. We conclude with future directions for research and considerations for practice.

We explored (1) subgroups of adolescents based on ethnic identity, bicultural identity integration, and behavioral acculturation; (2) their demographic correlates; and (3) whether the association between racial discrimination and anxiety varied across subgroups and gender. Latent profile analysis identified three profiles: bicultural, marginalized, and separated. Bicultural and marginalized adolescents were vulnerable to direct and vicarious racial discrimination, respectively. Moreover, bicultural and marginalized boys and separated girls were more negatively affected by COVID-19-related racial discrimination.

Participants were 132 Black youth (45% female; M age = 14.33 years at Time 1) who completed two annual home interviews. Results revealed that for adolescents with high (but not low) body mass indices (BMI), racial identity may be protective against developing weight concerns.

Understanding Factors Associated With Intimate Disclosure Between Black Youth and Nonparental Familial Adults	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Self-disclosure is an important relational process during adolescence. Given that Black adolescents contend with developmental changes and contextual risks, they may stand to benefit greatly from disclosing personal information to supportive nonparental adults. This qualitative study explored factors associated with youth intimate disclosure among 24 dyads of Black youth and their adult relatives. Analyses identified four types of adult behaviors associated with youth intimate disclosure: (1) setting the tone for youth disclosure, (2) expressing interest in youth well-being, (3) supportive engagement during disclosure, and (4) acting on youths' disclosure. Findings suggest that when adult relatives demonstrate interest and attunement to youths' needs, youth may feel more motivated to disclose.

The Role of Emotion Processing in the Association between Parental Discipline and Adolescent Socio-Emotional Development	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This research investigated whether biases in processing threatening emotional cues operate as an indirect pathway through which parental harsh discipline is associated with adolescent socio-emotional functioning. Participants were 192 adolescents (Mage = 12.4), and their parents assessed over two years. Findings revealed two significant indirect pathways involving fear processing. Greater parental harsh discipline was linked to more emotional response inhibition difficulty for fear, which was linked to more depressive symptoms in the following year. Greater parental harsh discipline was also associated with more emotional response inhibition difficulty for fear, and thereby, more peer problems later.

This study used a time-lagged design that recruited Chinese high school students in 2010 (N = 1,040) and 2018 (N = 1,302). Structured equation modeling revealed the total effects of acceptance/involvement and strictness/supervision on academic adjustment and their indirect effects through family obligation values were positive and statistically equivalent across cohorts. However, the indirect effect of psychological autonomy granting on academic adjustment through family obligation values was negative in 2010 (in rural) but was not statistically significant in 2018 (urban and rural). These findings indicate that along with the sociodemographic change toward Gesellschaft (e.g., more urbanized, wealthier, higher level of education), psychological autonomy granting tends to exert less negative influence on adolescents' adjustment in the later cohort.

This study extends this literature by connecting instability with violence in the community by examining the associations among family structure, family structure change, and secondary exposure to violence during adolescence across diverse segments of the population. Using longitudinal data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods study, we found that living with a single parent and experiencing family structure changes were associated with secondary exposure to violence. Multiple group models suggest that partner change translated into more exposure for boys than girls. Findings also suggest that family instability may lead to more secondary exposure to violence for African American youth.

Longitudinal Relations of Economic Hardship and Effortful Control to Active Coping in Latino Youth	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												How Latino youth cope with stressors may have implications for their adjustment. We examined how a temperamental characteristic (effortful control) and a contextual factor (economic hardship) were associated with Latino youth's coping. Individual differences in effortful control, a core facet of self-regulation, may contribute to coping as effortful control is consistently linked to adaptive behaviors during adolescence. We examined relations of effortful control and economic hardship to active coping in a sample of Mexican-origin youth (N = 674) across three time points (fifth to ninth grades). Although economic hardship negatively predicted coping and effortful control, effortful control positively predicted coping (controlling for prior levels). Findings support a resilience perspective by suggesting that effortful control may contribute to coping and thus counteract the negative effects of economic hardship.

However, it is unclear whether the links between paid work and college outcomes vary by either SES or race/ethnicity, or both. Using data from the Educational Longitudinal Study, we find that low-intensity work during high school is associated with positive college outcomes for almost all students, whereas the associations between high-intensity work and negative postsecondary outcomes are mostly limited to White students. Our results suggest that both differential selections into youth employment and differential consequences of youth employment contribute to these varying links between paid work and educational outcomes across different racial groups.

In Search of Modifiable Risk and Protective Factors for Teen Dating Violence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The present research explores the additive and interactive effects of anger or hostility (A/H), acceptance of violence (AoV), and constructive conflict resolution strategies (CRS) on the perpetration of physical and sexual teen dating violence (TDV). Adolescents completed surveys assessing physical and sexual TDV perpetration, A/H, AoV, and positive CRS. While the findings require replication with longitudinal data, the results suggest that developing interventions to modify AoV and A/H may have the potential to prevent instances of TDV perpetration among both boys and girls. The results for CRS were mixed and necessitate further exploration. These cross-sectional data provide insight into potentially fruitful areas of exploration for the development and tailoring of prevention strategies for teens at risk for physical and sexual TDV perpetration.

Hypotheses are derived from exposure, conflict, and constrict theory. Hypotheses are tested among 911 middle school students (43 classrooms, nine schools) in the Netherlands. Multilevel (p(2)) social network analyses show that students were more likely to engage in same-ethnic rather than cross-ethnic friendships. In line with conflict theory, greater classroom and neighborhood diversity were related to stronger tendencies to choose same-ethnic rather than cross-ethnic friends, among both ethnic majority and minority students. Diversity did not hamper reciprocity, as students in more ethnically diverse classrooms were even more likely to reciprocate friendships.

Data were from 1,713 school-based adolescents participating in a randomized controlled trial, in Victoria, Australia. Family help seeking emerged as a single factor, distinct from family support, and was prospectively associated with improved psychosocial outcomes. Father closeness predicted lower depressive symptoms. Family help seeking predicted higher help seeking for peers.

Academic Growth Trajectories and Family Relationships Among African American Youth	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study explored trajectories of African American youths' academic functioning and assessed whether changes in parent-adolescent relationships were associated with changes in youths' academic functioning. The data were drawn from a 3-year longitudinal study of gender socialization and development in two-parent African American families and included 197 families. Findings revealed gender differences in achievement trajectories and indicated that boys not only had lower levels of academic achievement compared to girls, but also experienced steeper declines in school self-esteem during adolescence. Changes in parent-adolescent relationship quality were linked to changes in academic functioning: Increases in conflict were related to decreases in GPA, school bonding, and school self-esteem and increases in warmth were related to increases in school bonding and school self-esteem.

The Role of Friends and Peers in Adolescent Body Dissatisfaction: A Review and Critique of 15 Years of Research	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												We review the research conducted in the past 15years concerned with the role of friends and peers in adolescent body dissatisfaction. A number of friend and peer group characteristics have been associated with heightened body dissatisfaction both concurrently and longitudinally. Most widely studied and more consistently linked to body dissatisfaction are appearance teasing and perceived pressure from friends to be thin. Other interactions between friends and peers that communicate and strengthen appearance ideals and direct attention to appearance also have been associated with body dissatisfaction, including appearance-related conversations, friends' modeling of dieting behavior, and perceptions of friends' appearance-related attitudes. Finally, the research is critiqued, new directions considered, and strategies are proposed that could be implemented to reduce body dissatisfaction.

Family Capital: Conceptual Model to Unpack the Intergenerational Transfer of Advantage in Transitions to Adulthood	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The achievement of the traditional milestones associated with adulthood within the current cohort of young adults appears to differ by social class backgrounds, and these differences may be growing due to the differential support of natal families. However, existing research and theory that looks at intergenerational social mobility does not fully examine the multidimensional aspect of family capital and how this capital is deployed during transitions to adulthood. Therefore, building on the work of Pierre Bourdieu on the forms of family capital in the parental investment framework, this article proposes a conceptual model that examines three kinds of resources that natal families marshal and the mechanisms through which these resources are deployed during transitions to adulthood.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				SEP	2014	24	3			SI		471	484		10.1111/jora.12119	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12119													WOS:000344789300006

Analyses apply a stochastic actor-based model to friendship networks assessed five times from 6th through 9th grades for 50 grade cohort networks in Iowa and Pennsylvania, which include 13,214 individuals. Results show definite influence and selection for similarity in alcohol use, as well as reciprocal influences between drinking and frequently being chosen as a friend. These findings suggest that adolescents view alcohol use as an attractive, high-status activity and that friendships expose adolescents to opportunities for drinking.

The Relationship of Smoking Status to Alcohol Use, Problems, and Health Behaviors in College Freshmen	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Differences in drinking, consequences, and perceptions were examined between alcohol-using college students by smoking status (current, past, and lifetime nonsmoker). Entering freshmen (N = 558: 45% male, 72% Caucasian, age M = 18) completed a questionnaire assessing smoking, drinking and current health perceptions. Results indicated current smokers drank more frequently, were more likely to drink to intoxication, and had more physiological consequences (e.g., blackouts, coordination problems) than past or lifetime nonsmokers, but past smokers also reported riskier drinking than lifetime nonsmokers. Despite a higher prevalence of alcohol-related health problems in both current and past smokers, no current health differences were found. Results replicate findings that current smokers are at increased risk for problematic drinking and identify past smokers as another risk group.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2012	22	4					758	767		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2012.00816.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2012.00816.x													WOS:000311107000014

Mechanisms of Family Impact on African American Adolescents' HIV-Related Behavior	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												A longitudinal model that tested mediating pathways between protective family processes and HIV-related behavior was evaluated with 195 African American youth. Three waves of data were collected when the youth were 13, 15, and 19 years old. Evidence of mediation and temporal priority were assessed for 3 constructs: academic engagement, evaluations of prototypical risk-taking peers, and affiliations with risk-promoting peers. Structural equation modeling indicated that protective family processes assessed during early adolescence were associated with HIV-related behavior during emerging adulthood and that academic engagement, evaluations of prototypical risk-taking peers, and affiliations with risk-promoting peers accounted for this association. Evidence of a specific pathway emerged: protective family processes -> academic engagement -> negative evaluations of prototypical risk-taking peers -> affiliations with risk-promoting peers -> HIV-related behavior.

Normative Sexuality Development in Adolescence: A Decade in Review, 2000-2009	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This review details a key innovation across the field of adolescent sexuality research over the last decade-conceptualizing sexuality as a normative aspect of adolescent development. Anchored in a growing articulation of adolescent sexuality as having positive qualities and consequences, we provide an organizing framework for understanding sexuality as normative and developmentally expected. Using this framework, we report on 3 specific areas of research that have developed "critical mass" over the past decade: new views on sexual behavior, sexual selfhood, and sexual socialization in the 21st century. We conclude by suggesting that the next step in the field of adolescent sexuality development is the explicit integration of "positive" dimensions of sexuality with risk management dimensions. Rather than navigating a binary between positive and risky, we propose characterizing the "both/and" quality of adolescent sexuality development as normative. This framework, we argue, encourages empirical research that assumes a wide range of strategies through which adolescents learn about themselves, their bodies, intimate partners, and relationships within contexts where they are required to both manage risks and develop positive patterns for adulthood sexuality. We conclude with considerations for future research and public policy.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2011	21	1					242	255		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00726.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00726.x													WOS:000287374300017

The aim of this research is to move this standpoint of analysis more centrally into the area of adolescent dating and sexuality by focusing on the cultural components of adolescent romantic relationships. This study examines cultural models of romantic relationships in Vernacular Term Interviews of 68 African American and 59 Mexican American 11th- and 12th-grade female and male high school students. A subset of interviews was analyzed first qualitatively to identify the models. The models then were committed to a manual and 4 analytic coders established reliability before coding all interviews blind as to race/ethnicity and gender of the adolescent. The resultant data were summarized by a principal components analysis that yielded 5 interpretable factors. Factor scores were computed and compared for gender and race/ethnicity differences. The results demonstrated clear differences in factors by race/ethnicity but not by gender. Results are discussed in relation to cultural differences described in the literature for these 2 populations.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2009	19	2					313	351		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00598.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00598.x													WOS:000266243800007

Youth 15-18 years of age who relocated to more advantaged neighborhoods reported lower school performance and more hyperactive behavior problems and substance use than peers who remained in impoverished neighborhoods. Program effects on parenting also emerged, with mover parents reporting less stringent monitoring and harsh disciplinary techniques than stayers. Family economic resources and neighborhood conditions, assessed approximately 5 years before, accounted for some of the program effects at 7 years.

Peer nominations of rejection, self-report measures of anxious and angry rejection expectations, and social anxiety, social withdrawal, and loneliness were assessed at two time points. Results indicate that peer rejection at Time I predicted an increase in anxious and angry expectations of rejection at Time 2, but only for boys. Being liked by peers, irrespective of level of dislike, predicted a reduction in anxious rejection expectations in both boys and girls. Further, anxious expectations of rejection were uniquely predictive of increased social anxiety and withdrawal. Angry expectations of rejection, an established unique predictor of increased aggression, predicted decreased social anxiety. Both anxious and angry expectations predicted increased loneliness, but neither were unique predictors of loneliness. Implications of viewing anxious and angry expectations of rejection as distinct cognitive-affective vulnerabilities for adolescents are discussed.

Youth completed questionnaires and provided official school records in the 12th grade and participated in a phone interview 3 years later. Youth from immigrant families demonstrated the same level of postsecondary educational progress as their peers from American-born families across a broad array of indicators. In addition, youth from immigrant families were more likely to support their families financially, and some were more likely to live with their parents as compared with those from American-born families. Variability among those from immigrant families suggested that youth from families with higher incomes, higher levels of parental education, and East Asian backgrounds were more likely to enroll and persist in postsecondary schooling as compared with their peers.																			1050-8392						2004	14	2					159	183		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2004.01402002.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2004.01402002.x													WOS:000221766500002

Exposure to nontraditional lifestyles opens up new socialization opportunities and raises the possibility of stress-inducing dissonance between participating socializing agents and the messages they deliver.

A physiological marker of stress (antibodies against the Epstein-Barr virus) is employed to overcome some of the difficulties associated with measuring stress outcomes. Socialization ambiguity is found to be a significant source of stress on the remote island of Savai'i and the transitional area of rural Upolu, although the direction of the association is different, possibly reflecting divergent socialization goals in these two regions.

Children completed measures of depression, social anxiety, loneliness, and self-esteem when they were in grades 4 to 6 (Time 1), and again 6 years later during adolescence (grades 10-12; Time 2). At Time 2, adolescents also reported their self-concept and their identification with reputation-based peer crowds, including Populars, Jocks, Brains, Burnouts, Non-Conformists, and None/Average crowds. Results indicated that adolescents' report of peer crowd affiliation was concurrently associated with self-concept and levels of internalizing distress, Follow-back analyses of internalizing trajectories revealed that Populars/Jocks had experienced significant declines in internalizing distress across development, whereas Brains exhibited some increases in internalizing distress between childhood and adolescence.

J	Leventhal, T; Graber, JA; Brooks-Gunn, J				Leventhal, T; Graber, JA; Brooks-Gunn, J			Adolescent transitions to young adulthood: Antecedents, correlates, and consequences of adolescent employment	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The antecedents, correlates, and consequences of adolescent employment were investigated in a sample of 251 low-income, African American youth that were followed since birth. The youth (age: M at preschool = 4.89, SD = .70; M at adolescence = 16.44, SD = .66; M at transition to adulthood = 19.36, SD = .76; and M at early adulthood = 27.67, SD = .75) were the firstborn children of African American teenage mothers who gave birth in Baltimore in the 1960s. Analyses examined the antecedents and correlates of age of entry into employment and stability of employment during adolescence. The associations of adolescent work experiences with subsequent adult education and employment outcomes also were considered. Findings indicate that among this sample of low-income, African American youth, those who repeated a grade in school during middle childhood were more likely to enter the workforce at later ages than their peers who did not repeat a grade. The small subset of adolescents who never worked (n = 12) appear to be markedly more disadvantaged than their peers who worked. At the transition to adulthood, adolescents who entered the workforce earlier were more likely to complete high school than their peers. In addition, stable employment during the adolescent years had more beneficial effects on young men's chances of attending college than young women's postsecondary education. This pattern of findings is consistent with ethnographic accounts of adolescent employment among poor, minority, urban youth.

This research explores these relationships among contemporary young sexual-minority women. Phone interviews with 80 lesbian, bisexual, and unlabeled women between 18 and 25 years of age (M = 21.8, SD = 2.1) assessed characteristics of their closest adolescent friendships. Cluster analysis differentiated conventional from passionate friendships, the latter containing more characteristics of romantic relationships. Same-sex friendships were not more likely than cross-sex friendships to be classified as passionate, and passionate friendships were not disproportionately likely to involve sexual attraction. Same-sex passionate friendships were initiated at earlier ages than same-sex conventional friendships, and those that developed prior to a young woman's first same-sex sexual contact were less likely to involve sexual attraction. Future research should investigate the incidence and developmental implications of such relationships among all adolescents.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2000	10	2					191	209																WOS:000086241200004

Parents can promote such activity through examples set by personal involvement in the community and through reinforcement of their children's interests. Using data (N = 362) from the 9th and 10th grade waves of the Iowa Youth and Families Project (Conger & Elder, 1994), we find that both the behavioral model set by parents and their personal reinforcement of children's actions make significant differences in the extracurricular activity involvement of boys and girls. However, parental reinforcement is most consequential when parents are not engaged in community activities. In this situation, warm parents are likely to reinforce their children, and this reinforcement strengthens children's involvement in community activities. The family dynamics of civic socialization deserve more attention than they have received to date.																			1050-8392						2000	10	1					29	48		10.1207/SJRA1001_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/SJRA1001_2													WOS:000084832600002

We administered surveys, including a scale assessing perceptions of home-school dissonance, to an ethnically diverse sample of students (N = 475) in the 5th grade in elementary school and the following year in middle school. Contrary to our hypothesis, African American students did not report more dissonance than European American students. High dissonance students (top 3rd on the Dissonance scale) were more angry and self-deprecating, had lower self-esteem, were less hopeful, felt less academically efficacious, and had a lower grade point average than did low dissonance students (bottom 3rd on the scale). Additionally, high dissonance students experienced a greater decline in grade point average, and less of a decline in anger than did low dissonance students when they moved to middle school.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					1999	9	4					441	466		10.1207/s15327795jra0904_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0904_4													WOS:000083558500004

Findings revealed that pubertal development was associated with parent-child conflict and that the pattern of results was different for boys and girls. Specifically, parents reported using more verbal aggression with sons during midpuberty than early or late puberty and having more "hot" discussions with sons who matured early or late versus on time. Sons reported discussing more hot issues and having more hot discussions when they were more developed than when they were less developed. Parents reported using more violent tactics with younger daughters than older daughters and discussing more hot issues and having more hot discussions with daughters who matured early versus on time or late. Findings are discussed within a framework of understanding links between parent-child conflict and puberty in more diverse samples of adolescents.

J	Hamilton, SF; Lempert, W				Hamilton, SF; Lempert, W			The impact of apprenticeship on youth: A prospective analysis	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												European apprenticeship systems, especially Germany's, have inspired a series of demonstration projects in the United States and a major new initiative by the Clinton administration, which is embodied in the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994. German research on apprenticeship provides some prospective insights into how participation in apprenticeship and apprentice-like experiences might affect adolescents in the United States. Four questions guide an examination of that literature: How are young people allocated to apprenticeships and thereby to occupations? What are the occupational prospects for workers who have completed apprenticeships? How does apprenticeship affect young people's political socialization? How does apprenticeship affect young people's personality development? Results are summarized in recommendations for the design of a U.S. system.																			1050-8392						1996	6	4					427	455																WOS:A1996VT15100005

Participants included ninth and tenth grade students from five public schools in the Southeastern United States, (N = 577, 45.9% female, 49% male, 5% other/prefer not to say/unsure). Students were ethnically representative of their communities: 48% White/European American, 22.7% Black/African American, 14% Latino/a/e/x, and 15.3% multi-racial/other/prefer not to say. Measures assessed adolescents' responses to hypothetical scenarios of unfair treatment. The findings indicate that adolescents recognize both teacher and peer unfair behavior as wrong, with nuanced differences based on participants' gender and grade. Attribution analysis reveals varied expected reasons for unfair treatment. Responses to unfair behavior differ, with adolescents more likely to confront peers than teachers. Demographic factors, school climate, discrimination, belonging, and critical consciousness contribute to variations in judgments and responses. The study highlights the importance of addressing unfair treatment in STEM settings to foster inclusivity and support student persistence in STEM.

J	Marfo, K				Marfo, Kofi			Toward a globally inclusive knowledge base on adolescent development: A charge to the Majority World and a plea for epistemic and paradigmatic pluralism	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Ongoing internal dialog on the limitations of Euro-American developmental science has opened up space to explore how best to work toward a knowledge base that is adequately representative of the values, cultures, epistemic traditions, and lived experiences of peoples, nations, and regions around the world. So far, recommendations for the advancement of a global developmental science have focused preponderantly on (1) methodological considerations and (2) an architecture to support cross-disciplinary international collaborative inquiry and/or enhance research capacity building for Majority World scholars and institutions. In this commentary, instead of focusing on specific contributions to the Special Issue, I make a case for an explicit commitment to field-building within Majority World contexts as the primary gap-closing path toward the cultivation of a global developmental science knowledge base. I begin with a worldwide population analysis to demonstrate the magnitude of geopolitical, eco-cultural, and epistemic imbalances inherent in the shaping of Euro-American developmental science. In tandem with the Special Issue's central theme, I draw on scholarship from the fields of history, sociology, and political economy to link decolonial theory to the advancement of a global developmental science. Finally, I explore ways in which exemplary research establishments already engaged in prolific inquiry and research training may be ideal candidates to support field-building and help to advance multidisciplinary inquiry within an ethos of epistemic and methodological pluralism.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2024	34	2			SI		507	512		10.1111/jora.12979	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12979		MAY 2024						38803300					WOS:001232139000001

Short-term changes in social role statuses across young adulthood and their relation to heavy drinking in a given month	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Young adulthood is a developmental period during which individuals experience shifts in their social roles in various domains, which coincides with a period of time that is also high risk for lifetime peaks in alcohol use. The current study examined age-related changes in heavy episodic drinking (HED) and high-intensity drinking (HID) and associations with short-term (i.e., monthly) variation in young adults' social roles over a 2.5-year period in a community sample of young adults who reported past-year alcohol use (N = 778, baseline age range 18-23). Results showed probabilities of past-month HED and HID changed in a nonlinear fashion across ages 18-26 with greater probabilities of use at younger ages. Most participants did not report being in the same social role status every sampled month, underscoring the presence of short-term role variation. Living with parents and being in a serious romantic relationship in a given month were negatively associated with past-month HED. Living with parents in a given month was also negatively associated with past-month HID. Being a 4-year college student and being employed full-time in a given month were not significantly related to either outcome. Findings provided partial evidence that monthly statuses were associated with heavy drinking. Several avenues for future research are described in light of the findings.

Mother-child dynamics: Examining reciprocal relations between parental knowledge, child disclosure, parental legitimacy beliefs, and adolescent alcohol use	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Early adolescent alcohol use is associated with adverse developmental and health outcomes. Parental knowledge can prevent or delay substance use, while youth behaviors may concurrently influence parenting. More research is needed to examine the role of youth's perceptions of legitimacy of parental authority. This multi-informant study examined prospective bidirectional effects between parental knowledge and child disclosure alongside youth-reported alcohol use and perceived legitimacy of parental authority. Data were analyzed across three waves in a community sample of 304 mother-child dyads. A cross-lagged panel model was estimated using repeated measures of adolescent alcohol use, perceived legitimacy of parental authority, parental knowledge, and child disclosure. Positive reciprocal associations were found in early adolescence between child disclosure and both parental knowledge and perceived legitimacy of parental authority. Legitimacy of parental authority negatively predicted alcohol use across adolescence. Child alcohol use also negatively predicted parental knowledge among mothers in later adolescence. Effects were not reciprocated nor sustained. Novel findings demonstrate that the parental legitimacy beliefs predict reduced alcohol use and have a reciprocal association with child disclosure. Clinical implications to mitigate youth alcohol use initiation, by enhancing parental self-efficacy and positive parenting, are discussed.

Self-esteem and self-concept as correlates of life satisfaction and attitudes toward school among Ghanaian girls	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												During adolescence, youth experience several physical, psychosocial, and cognitive changes. Self-esteem and self-concept are identified as protective factors for adolescents in high-income countries, but studies are limited in sub-Saharan Africa. We examined the associations of self-esteem and self-concept with life satisfaction and attitudes toward school using baseline data from 97 Ghanaian adolescent girls at risk of school dropout. Ordinary Least Squares regression models were fitted to examine the association between self-esteem and self-concept on school attitudes and life satisfaction. Self-esteem was positively associated with life satisfaction. Self-concept was associated with more positive attitudes toward school. Hence, self-esteem and self-concept may be critical protective factors in promoting adolescent girls' life satisfaction and positive attitudes toward school.

The second goal was to study the probability of inclusion in each trajectory class arising from gratitude and forgiveness (understood as the absence of negative emotions and the presence of positive emotions toward an aggressor) while controlling for gender and age. The study included two short-term longitudinal samples from two Latin American countries: Colombia (N = 212, M age = 13.82 years, SD = 1.25) and Uruguay (N = 269, M age = 14.02 years, SD = 1.39). The data were collected at three time points within a 3-month interval. The first finding indicated that different patterns in ingroup and outgroup prosocial behavior in adolescents emerged in both Latin American countries. Moreover, two classes-high and low-were identified in the trajectory of ingroup prosocial behavior, while three different classes-high, moderate, and low-were found in the trajectory of outgroup prosocial behavior in both countries. The results indicated that high levels of gratitude increased the probability that Uruguayan adolescents were included in the group of adolescents with high levels of ingroup prosocial behavior. High levels of positive emotions toward an aggressor (a dimension of forgiveness) increased the probability that a Colombian adolescent belonged to the group of adolescents with high levels of ingroup prosociality. Regarding outgroup prosocial behavior, different predictors were also identified between the countries. The results indicated that high levels of gratitude and positive emotions toward an aggressor increased the probability that Uruguayan adolescents were included in the group of adolescents with high or moderate levels of outgroup prosocial behavior. Only positive emotions toward an aggressor increased the probability that Colombian adolescents were included in the group of adolescents with high or moderate levels of outgroup prosocial behavior.

Companion animals and the relationship between peer victimization and emotion regulation in youth	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Peer victimization can negatively impact emotion regulation in youth and is associated with harmful mental health outcomes. One protective factor against the impacts of peer victimization is a strong attachment to family and positive peer relationships. Given that pets are commonly seen as family members and that youth report turning to their pet for emotional comfort, companion animals could provide an avenue of support for youth experiencing victimization. A geographically diverse sample of 5725 adolescents in the United States from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (R) was used to explore whether the relationship between peer victimization and emotion regulation was moderated by whether a pet lives in the home. Having a pet in the home did not moderate the relationship between peer victimization and emotion regulation; however, mean-level differences were present across types of household pet (i.e., youth with no pets, youth with at least one dog, and youth with non-dog pets). Participants who did not live with a companion animal showed higher levels of both maladaptive emotion regulation (expressive suppression) and adaptive emotion regulation (cognitive reappraisal), suggesting that having a pet might lower overall emotion regulation pathways regardless of adaptive directionality. Relational victimization was a significant predictor of expressive suppression regardless of whether there was a pet in the home, although overt victimization was not a predictor of either kind of emotion regulation. This research demonstrates the complex nature of human-animal relationships and suggests more research is needed to understand the nuanced relationship between pets, peer victimization, and emotion regulation.					; Halbreich, Eli D./ABE-9213-2021	Mueller, Megan/0000-0001-9058-0894; Halbreich, Eli D./0000-0003-4942-9804; Callina, Kristina/0000-0003-1628-1145; King, Erin/0000-0002-7045-4396													1050-8392	1532-7795				MAR	2024	34	1					85	95		10.1111/jora.12901	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12901		NOV 2023						37975498					WOS:001106350400001

Using five waves of data collected over the course of high school (N = 618), we modeled growth trajectories of awareness of inequity (critical reflection), a sense of agency about taking sociopolitical action (critical agency), and behaviors targeting systems of oppression (critical action). Hope was highest among those with high trajectories of critical agency and critical action. Clear associations with hope emerged at the last time point for critical reflection, suggesting that sustained growth in critical reflection is associated with hope. When supporting the critical consciousness development of youth of color, concurrent support for hope may be instrumental.

Mother-adolescent dyads (N = 180; 96 male; ages 10-15) completed in-person interactions and then the mothers participated in a video-mediated recall procedure to assess maternal attributions. Maternal depression was associated with negative attributions. Negative attributions were associated with low parental acceptance, aggressive parenting, and low positive parenting. Positive maternal attributions were associated with less aggressive parenting, and more positive parenting during one interaction task. Adolescent externalizing behaviors were associated with negative attributions.

Written statements from 225 adolescents (age 13-16 years, M = 14.4 years, SD = 0.93) were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results indicated a range of situations including both explicit and implicit pressure. The pressure elicited different emotional responses, including severe physical and psychological reactions, becoming distressed, and being seemingly unconcerned. A majority of the adolescents reported successful strategies on how to ward off the unwanted sexual requests. This study provides insight into how young people cope with potentially harmful situations online.

An Observational Approach to Examining White Parents' Racial Socialization Practices With Adolescent Youth	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The racial socialization (RS) strategies used by White parents have received limited empirical attention. Thus, the current study examined the frequency and content of White parents' RS messages to their White children during an observed parent-child discussion task on discrimination when youth were 14 years old. Participants were 243 White caregivers and their adolescent children (47.7% female). Overall, parents provided few RS messages, but when they did, they often relayed egalitarian messages or messages minimizing racism. Other types of RS strategies that emerged included acknowledging racism targeting people of color, discriminatory attitudes, and false beliefs in reverse racism.

The aim of the present study was to examine how Latina mothers' experiences with discrimination were associated with short-term changes in their adolescent children's academic performance, directly and indirectly through mothers' appraisal of home-school dissonance. Data were drawn from an ongoing longitudinal study of 547 mother-youth dyads in suburban Atlanta. Results showed a significant indirect relationship between mothers' experiences of discrimination and declines in adolescents' grade point average by way of increased home-school dissonance. Thus, Latina mothers' discriminatory experiences may have spillover effects on adolescent academic achievement through increasing proximal barriers to parent involvement.

Using national and longitudinal survey data from Black, Latinx, and White adolescents (N = 3004; 49% girls), we found that the police stopped more Black boys and Black girls than their ethnic-racial peers. Vicarious stops were prevalent among all groups. The effects of police stops on adolescents' adjustment outcomes were more detrimental for adolescents of color and particularly Black boys relative to their White peers. Implications are discussed regarding how law enforcement shapes disparities that disadvantage particular adolescents at the intersections of their ethnicity-race and gender.

Adolescent Adjustment During COVID-19: The Role of Close Relationships and COVID-19-related Stress	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												During the COVID-19 pandemic, adolescents' typical social support systems have been disrupted. The present study examined adolescent adjustment during the pandemic (summer, 2020) while controlling for pre-pandemic adjustment (2017-2018) in 170 youth (ages 12-20) from Missouri and Florida. We also examined whether positive and negative relationship qualities with four close others (i.e., mothers, fathers, siblings, and best friends) interacted with COVID-related stress to impact adolescent adjustment. In general, we found that close relationships impacted adolescent adjustment in expected directions (i.e., positive relationships better for adjustment, negative relationships more detrimental), but while mothers and fathers impacted adolescent adjustment in largely similar ways to pre-pandemic studies, influences of relationships with best friends and sibling were more impacted by COVID-related stress.

Prepandemic Risk Factors of COVID-19-Related Concerns in Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												To identify adolescents who may be at risk for adverse outcomes, we examined the extent of COVID-19-related concerns reported by adolescents and investigated which prepandemic risk and protective factors predicted these concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dutch adolescents (N = 188; M-age = 13.49, SD = .81) were assessed before the pandemic and at eight and ten months into the pandemic. Results demonstrated that adolescents' most frequently reported COVID-19-related concerns were about social activities and getting delayed in school. Adolescents that have specific vulnerabilities before the pandemic (i.e., higher stress, maladaptive coping, or internalizing problems) experience more concerns during the pandemic, stressing the importance of guiding and supporting these adolescents in order to prevent adverse developmental outcomes.

This paper examines the association of psychological well-being (PWB) with violent radicalism and nonviolent activism, by focusing on the mediating role of both social disconnectedness (SD) and the perceived illegitimacy of the authorities (PIoA). Two mediation structural equation models (full vs. partial) were applied to data collected from 328 Italian adolescents (14-19 years). The results showed how SD and PIoA fully mediated the link of PWB with radicalism (negatively) and activism (positively). This model was further supported when compared with an alternative one proposing PWB as a mediator between SD and PIoA. The findings are discussed in light of the existing literature and provide potential implications for practice.

Expectations of Social Consequences Impact Anticipated Involvement in Health-Risk Behavior During Adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined how individual differences in expectations of social consequences relate to individuals' expected involvement in health-risk behaviors (HRBs). A total of 122 adolescents (aged 11-17) reported their expected involvement in a number of risk behaviors and whether or not they expect to be liked more or less by engaging in the behavior: the expected social benefit. Higher perceived social benefit was associated with higher anticipated involvement in said behavior. This relationship was stronger for adolescents who reported a higher degree of peer victimization, supporting the hypothesis that experiencing victimization increases the social value of peer interactions. Findings suggest that adolescents incorporate expectations of social consequences when making decisions regarding their involvement in HRBs.

How Does High School Extracurricular Participation Predict Bachelor's Degree Attainment? It is Complicated	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study answered novel questions about the connection between high school extracurricular dosage (number of activities and participation duration) and the attainment of a bachelor's degree. Using data from the Common Application and the National Student Clearinghouse (N = 311,308), we found that greater extracurricular participation positively predicted bachelor's degree attainment. However, among students who ultimately earned a bachelor's degree, participating in more than a moderate number of high school activities (3 or 4) predicted decreasing odds of earning a bachelor's degree on time (within 4 years). This effect intensified as participation duration increased, such that students who participated in the greatest number of high school activities for the most years were the most likely to delay college graduation.

However, its underlying processes are not fully understood. This study examined the effects of social norms, conveyed through peer advice, on risk-taking behavior in 15- to 17-year-old adolescents (N=76). Participants played a card-guessing task alone and with online peer advice. Results showed that risk-taking increased in the presence of peers. The results further showed that adolescents took into account the uncertainty associated with gambles, as well as the social norms conveyed by peers.

Predicting Well-Being and Internalizing Symptoms in Late Adolescence From Trajectories of Externalizing Behavior Starting in Infancy	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study aimed to examine the long-term prediction of well-being and internalizing symptoms from trajectories of externalizing behavior problems in 921 children from a population-based sample. We found that a high stable trajectory of externalizing behavior from infancy (age 1.5) to mid-adolescence (age 14.5) predicted lower scores on life satisfaction and flourishing for both girls and boys (age 18.5). The high stable trajectory also predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms in boys and anxiety symptoms in girls (age 18.5). The findings are noteworthy as they document how a person-oriented study of externalizing behavior problems starting in infancy can predict well-being and internalizing in late adolescence.

Beyond Collective Supervision: Informal Social Control, Prosocial Investment, and Juvenile Offending in Urban Neighborhoods	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This article examines prosocial investment and supervision of youth as separate indicators of informal social control. Data from 599 survey respondents in 90 Indianapolis, IN, block groups indicate that, at the neighborhood level, the relationship between these two variables and delinquency during early and middle adolescence varies by severity of offense. Specifically, negative binomial models reveal an inverse relationship between supervision and both status offenses and misdemeanors, but the relationship with misdemeanors is stronger in areas with higher levels of prosocial investment. In contrast, prosocial investment has an inverse association with felony charges. Overall, these results call for future quantitative scholarship that contextualizes neighborhood-level supervision and that is attentive to neighborhood support and empowerment assets in models of urban adolescent delinquency.

Child aggression was hypothesized to contribute to parenting stress, which should increase aggression. Parents and teachers of 239 German children aged between 6 and 15years completed measures of child aggression at Time 1 and Time 3, complemented by children's self-reports of aggression at Time 3. Parents rated their child-focused and parent-focused stress at an intermediate measurement Time 2. Child-focused stress mediated the path from Time 1 to Time 3 aggression in boys and girls, whereas parent-focused stress was unrelated to Time 3 aggression.

Pubertal Timing as a Potential Mediator of Adoption Effects on Problem Behaviors	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Adopted children show more problem behaviors than nonadopted children. Given that internationally adopted individuals show earlier puberty than nonadopted individuals, and early puberty is associated with problem behaviors in nonadopted youth, we analyzed data from adopted domestic adoptees to determine whether problem behaviors could be explained by differences in pubertal timing. Relative to nonadopted controls (n = 153), domestically adopted girls (n = 121) had earlier menarche, earlier sexual initiation, and more conduct disorder symptoms. Age at menarche partially mediated the relation of adoptive status to sexual initiation, but not to conduct disorder symptoms. Extending findings from international adoptees, results show that domestic adoption is also linked to earlier puberty, and suggest early puberty as one mechanism linking adoption to problematic outcomes.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2012	22	4					739	745		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2012.00820.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2012.00820.x								23335840					WOS:000311107000012

Voluntary After-School Alcohol and Drug Programs for Middle School Youth: If You Build it Right, They Will Come	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Few after-school programs target alcohol and other drug (AOD) use because it is difficult to encourage a diverse group of youth to voluntarily attend. The current study describes CHOICE, a voluntary after-school program which targeted AOD use among middle school students. Over 4,000 students across eight schools completed surveys and 15% participated in CHOICE. Analyses indicated that there were some differences between CHOICE participants and nonparticipants. For example, African American and multiethnic students were more likely to attend. Past month alcohol users were more likely to initially attend, and marijuana users were more likely to continue attendance. Thus, CHOICE reached students of different racial and ethnic groups and attracted higher risk youth who may not typically obtain prevention services.

Though negative effects of high-intensity work on adolescent adjustment have been found, little research has addressed whether such work experiences are associated with precocious family formation behaviors in adolescence, such as sexual intercourse, pregnancy, residential independence, and union formation. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we find that teenagers who spend long hours on the job during the school year are more likely to experience these family formation behaviors earlier than youth who work moderately or not at all.

J	Rivas-Drake, D				Rivas-Drake, Deborah			Public Ethnic Regard and Academic Adjustment Among Latino Adolescents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined whether Latino adolescents' perceptions of personal support vis-a-vis those of ethnic regard by adults at school differentially relate to academic outcomes. Data were drawn from a sample of 156 Latino students (age M = 16.17, SD = 1.27; 61% girls, 39% boys) attending an urban high school. As expected, youth who perceived more positive public ethnic regard (i.e., by adults at school) were more engaged and higher achieving than their counterparts with more negative public regard. Importantly, after accounting for personal support from adults in school, public ethnic regard contributed uniquely to the variance explained by models predicting academic engagement and performance. These results suggest that public ethnic regard comprises a meaningful dimension of Latino adolescents' relationships with adults in school.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2011	21	3					537	544		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00700.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00700.x													WOS:000293790200001

We examined overall trends and patterns based on youths' post-high school educational plans. Findings point to declines in recent cohorts' involvement in conventional and alternative forms of engagement but greater involvement in community service. Regardless of period, the majority of youth said they intended to vote when eligible, but few expressed trust in the government or elected officials.

Moderating the Effects of Childhood Exposure to Intimate Partner Violence: The Roles of Parenting Characteristics and Adolescent Peer Support	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												We investigate parenting characteristics and adolescent peer support as potential moderators of the effects of childhood exposure to intimate partner violence (IPV) on adolescent outcomes. Lehigh Longitudinal Study (N=416) data include parent and adolescent reports of childhood IPV exposure. Exposure to IPV predicted nearly all adverse outcomes examined; however, after accounting for co-occurring child abuse and early child behavior problems, IPV predicted only 1 outcome. Several moderator effects were identified. Parental "acceptance" of the child moderated the effects of IPV exposure on the likelihood of teenage pregnancy and running away from home. Both peer communication and peer trust moderated the relationship between exposure to IPV and depression and running from home. Peer communication also moderated the effects of IPV exposure on high school dropout. Interventions that influence parenting practices and strengthen peer support for youth exposed to IPV may increase protection and decrease risk of several tested outcomes.

J	Busseri, MA; Rose-Krasnor, L				Busseri, Michael A.; Rose-Krasnor, Linda			Addressing Three Common Issues in Research on Youth Activities: An Integrative Approach for Operationalizing and Analyzing Involvement	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Youth activity involvement has been operationalized and analyzed using a wide range of approaches. Researchers face the challenges of distinguishing between the effects of involvement versus noninvolvement and intensity of involvement in a particular activity, accounting simultaneously for cumulative effects of involvement, and addressing multiple unique effects of individual activities. In the present work, we review and illustrate the conceptual and empirical implications of these issues using data from a study of activity involvement and successful development in early adolescence (N=537; M age=11.56, 52% female). An integrative solution is introduced based on a latent composite variable (LCV) model (Bollen & Lennox, 1991), which can be used to address all three issues simultaneously. Using this approach, we show that of the aggregate indices examined, breadth of involvement was uniquely and positively associated with multiple indices of successful development. Of the individual activities, a dichotomous score and residual frequency rating for involvement in out-of-school clubs were both uniquely associated with less positive development indicators. We concluded that an LCV approach provides a novel method for addressing several fundamental operational and analytic issues facing researchers who investigate youth activity involvement as a context for positive development.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2010	20	3					583	615		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00652.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00652.x													WOS:000280995500003

JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Gender differences in the development of children's and adolescents' academic self-perceptions have received increasing attention in recent years. This study extends previous research by examining the development of mathematics self-concept across grades 7-12 in three cultural settings: Australia (Sydney; N=1,333), the United States (Michigan; N=2,443), and Germany (four federal states; N=4,688). Results of latent growth curve models document very similar patterns of self-concept development in males and females in the three settings. First, gender differences in favor of boys were observed at the beginning of the observation period (grade 7). Second, gender was not significantly related to self-concept change in either group, meaning that initial differences persisted across time. Third, the results provided no evidence that the form of the longitudinal change trajectories for mathematics self-concept differed across the cultural settings. This pattern of results is inconsistent with explanatory models that predict converging or diverging gender differences in mathematics self-concept. Furthermore, the results indicate that self-concept development may be highly similar across western cultural settings.

Losing Sleep Over It: Daily Variation in Sleep Quantity and Quality in Canadian Students' First Semester of University	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Daily covariation of sleep quantity and quality with affective, stressful, academic, and social experiences were observed in a sample of Canadian 17-19-year-olds in their first year of university. Participants (N=191) completed web-based checklists for 14 consecutive days during their first semester. Multilevel models predicting sleep quantity and quality from daily experiences indicated that more time on schoolwork, expecting a test, and alcohol use predicted less sleep whereas socializing predicted more sleep. More positive affect and no alcohol use predicted better sleep quality. Models predicting daily experiences from sleep the night before indicated that less sleep preceded increases in negative affect, decreases in schoolwork time, and a higher likelihood of socializing. Better sleep quality preceded increased positive affect, decreased negative affect and stress, and less time on schoolwork. These data are informative for understanding relations between sleep and daily experiences as they occur naturally in first-year university students.					, Jennifer/HPD-4891-2023; Howard, Andrea/ABC-1146-2021	Howard, Andrea/0000-0002-9843-9577													1050-8392	1532-7795					2009	19	4					741	761		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00618.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00618.x													WOS:000271974500008

Models specifying negative expectancies and refusal intentions as mediators of individual rights assertiveness and decision-making effects on substance initiation were evaluated across 18 months on a nontreatment cohort of young adolescents participating in a prevention trial (average age 12.3 years at baseline; N = 357). Results indicated that individual rights assertiveness and decision making had indirect effects on substance initiation through effects on negative outcome expectancies and refusal intentions. Gender differences were found in both the average level and the pattern of relationships among the variables. For girls, refusal intentions were negatively associated with later substance initiation. For boys, early levels of substance initiation were negatively associated with later levels of negative expectancies and refusal intentions.

Proportional hazards regression was used to examine the relation of demographic, biological, psychological, and social predictors to the timing of first intercourse. In the biopsychosocial model, different factors significantly predicted timing of first intercourse for girls and boys. For girls, always-married parents and less dating alone predicted later timing of first intercourse. Earlier timing of first intercourse for boys was related to associating with peers with lower achievement orientation and greater importance of popularity.					; Barber, Bonnie/B-4811-2008	Meschke, Laurie/0000-0002-9019-9927; Barber, Bonnie/0000-0002-8799-8453													1050-8392						2000	10	3					315	338		10.1207/SJRA1003_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/SJRA1003_5													WOS:000089363600006

Pressures to build strong university-community collaborations pose difficult problems for the academy because they demand interdisciplinary cooperation, rejection of provincial disciplinary turfism, and changes in the faculty reward system. Applied developmental science (ADS) represents a theoretical and methodological approach to university-community collaborations that emphasizes long-term commitment, asset building, individual differences, and the reciprocity of knowledge application and knowledge generation. In this article, we describe the emergence of ADS at Michigan State University and provide examples of youth-oriented educational, outreach, and applied research programs that invite faculty from broadly diverse disciplines to actively embrace the university's land-grant mission.																			1050-8392						1996	6	1					55	69																WOS:A1996TU16100005

The results suggest that the distinction between the three different types of perceived support appears to be meaningful and that the types of support differ in their relation with self-worth. Perceptions of approval from others, especially a ''generalized other'' peer-reference group, such as classmates, did bear a stronger relation to self-worth than did perceptions of emotional support or instrumental aid. There was no consistent gender difference in the relation between perceived support and self-worth, although several gender differences in the levels of perceived support were found.

Longitudinal, observational data were obtained by coding family interaction tasks administered to 96 adolescents at ages 14 and 16 and their one or two parents. These were then related to observer-rated adolescent depressive affect in an interview at age 16 and to self-reported internalizing and externalizing behavior at age 17. Results revealed that difficulties establishing autonomy and relatedness with parents were linked to both depressed affect and externalizing behaviors. However, depressed affect was more closely linked to difficulties establishing autonomy, whereas externalizing behaviors were more closely linked to difficulties maintaining relatedness.

Per & uacute; is a postcolonial country with many forms of inequality, and one of them is the opportunity gap to attend a college. However, most adolescents aspire to go to university as a way out of poverty, and, since Per & uacute; is a collectivist society, this is a family task: it is adolescents' responsibility to go to college in order to give a better life to their families. Theories developed for WEIRD societies (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) do not provide an accurate explanation of Peruvian adolescents' occupational projects because they envision a person with autonomy and resources to choose a career. Thus, our goal is to analyze adolescents' occupational plans considering the role adolescent-caregivers relationships play in this configuration. This study is part of the project "Being an adolescent in Per & uacute;" (PUCP-UNICEF) which characterized Peruvian adolescence by studying 14 variables through a qualitative study with 66 participants. In depth interviews were conducted and the data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Results of the thematic analysis are organized in three topics that explain the relationship between occupational plans and adolescent-caregiver relationship (1) adolescents have occupational aspirations rather than achievable projects that are that are built alone, without adult support; (2) attending college as an occupational aspiration belongs to the family, not to the individual operating also a kind of "debt" to pay to their caregivers for being financially supported to be able to study in high school; and (3) caregivers do not have the possibility or resources of being able to accompany their adolescent's occupational plans. We conclude that Peruvian adolescents think about their future within the framework of their family's needs, rather than linked to personal and occupational goals, impeding adolescents from exploring and selecting a realistic occupational goal consistent with their interests. The results allow us to discuss the relevance of studying adolescent development taking into account the particularities of the adolescents' cultural and socioeconomic contexts as well as the core role that relationship with caregivers plays in this process in Per & uacute;.

Cross-lagged panel models showed concurrent associations among adolescents' residential and digital contact with each parent, yet positively for fathers and negatively for mothers. Some cross-lagged paths revealed that higher-quality interactions may contribute to positive changes in contact. Although there were effects of parent-adolescent contact on family belongingness, over time belongingness was mostly predicted by the general quality of contact. The results suggest that post-divorce relationships require frequent and meaningful time together, the effects of which, however, do hardly transfer over time in terms of adolescents' belongingness.

Patterns in pro-gun beliefs and weapon carrying behaviors in rural White adolescent	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Weapon carrying among White rural populations is understudied although evidence suggests that rural White boys have high rates of carriage. This study delineated patterns of weapon use and pro-gun beliefs using a latent class analysis on a sample of 32,916 White rural adolescents. Five groups were identified (i.e., Low Gun Risk, Naive, Social Contagion, Independent, Unsupervised) using pro-gun beliefs, peer risk factors, and weapon carrying items. Multinomial logistic regression analyses revealed that identifying as male, age, housing instability, and victimization consistently differentiated group membership between different classes. These results suggest that rural White adolescents vary in their belief systems about guns and weapon carrying behavior and that this heterogeneity can be differentiated by lived experiences of these adolescents.

We interviewed 15 adolescents regarding their experiences with online racial discrimination. After a phenomenological analysis, four main themes emerged: types of online racial aggression, processes supporting online racism, personal coping, and strategies to prevent online racial aggression. These themes provided insights into adolescent experiences, including feelings about targeted online racial discrimination, intersectionality with sexual harassment, and comfort through processing with friends. This study highlights adolescents' thoughts regarding advocacy, education, and social media reform to prevent online racial aggression. Future research should ensure that youth voices from minoritized racial backgrounds are integrated into efforts to address these critical social issues.

The sample included 167 adolescents (53% males, M-age = 14 at Time 1 and M-age = 18 at Time 5) who were assessed five times. Adolescents self-reported on negative parenting, emotion regulation, externalizing symptomatology, and engagement in HRBs. Results suggest that increasingly negative parenting across adolescence has adverse consequences for emotion regulation development and in turn, externalizing symptomatology, which confers risk for young adult HRBs. Results offer insights towards mechanisms for prevention and intervention and public health policy aimed at reducing the prevalence and consequences of engagement in HRBs.

Examining Critical Reflection as a Mediator Between School Racial Climate Experiences and Anti-Racist Action	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Little is known about how different school racial climate experiences influence the critical reflection and subsequent critical action behaviors of racially minoritized youth. Therefore, the current study examined how critical reflection mediated the relationship between school racial climate profiles and critical action behaviors. Participants were 559 Black and Latinx adolescents, aged 13-17 who completed an online survey. Results indicated that critical reflection significantly mediated the relationships between interpersonal interactions (i.e., equal status) and anti-racist critical action behaviors. Similarly, the relationships between school racial socialization messages (i.e., cultural and critical consciousness socialization) and anti-racist critical action behaviors were also mediated by critical reflection. Findings have implications for how dimensions of the school racial climate differentially relate to racially minoritized youth's critical consciousness.

Of special interest was whether and how the participants included their experiences of dehumanization. Focus group data were analyzed using modified analytic induction. Participants felt good about their racially gendered identities but felt they occupied a precarious position in the United States. Participants' beliefs about how others viewed them motivated restraint from engaging in too many prosocial acts to prevent appearing vulnerable. Participants explicitly referred to their experience of oppression in these discussions and its interaction with identity and prosociality. Results suggest research must consider how macro-level processes like racism influence the identities and prosocial behaviors of adolescent Black males.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2022	32	2			SI		552	568		10.1111/jora.12746	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12746		APR 2022						35384133					WOS:000777928200001

Ten focus groups were conducted with 73 Black parents from a Southeastern city (73% female). Using modified grounded theory, narratives that supported adolescent engaged coping were coded for three ethnic-racial socialization messages, the perpetrator, and the setting, followed by inductive (open) coding. The majority of experiences were school-related. Themes were informed by parents' critical engagement, ethnic-racial socialization, and engaged racial coping. Findings revealed that parents advised a repertoire of engaged coping strategies, from actively confronting interpersonal perpetrators (e.g., peers), to critically engaging with institutional perpetrators. Strategies to develop adolescents' critical reflection and anti-racism actions to dismantle racism across contexts are discussed.

We found that daily discrimination was a low-frequency, but high-impact event associated with shorter sleep duration. Results pointed to the nuanced roles of daily support. Support from friends was negatively related to sleep duration, whereas support from parents appeared to be promotive to sleep quality. Support from teachers protected adolescents from the negative effects of discrimination on sleep duration. Implications for future interventions targeting sleep disturbances associated with discrimination are discussed.

Parental Support and Positive Mood Buffer Adolescents' Academic Motivation During the COVID-19 Pandemic	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												School closures during the first COVID-19 lockdown in 2020 severely disrupted adolescents' lives. We used a daily diary method for 20 days, including online and physical school days, assessing daily mood, social support and conflict, and academic motivation in 102 adolescents aged 12-16 years. We found that adolescents' academic motivation was lower on online compared with physical school days. In general, positive mood was positively associated with academic motivation, and friend conflict related negatively to academic motivation. Moreover, lower levels of parental support were related to lower academic motivation on online versus physical school days. Overall, these findings identified some critical changes in adolescents' daily experiences during the COVID-19 school closure and social-emotional factors that may buffer decreases in adolescents' academic motivation.

A total of 104 studies of 104,304 adolescents met inclusion criteria. Studies were mainly conducted in North America (43%) or Europe (34%). Over half studied engagement across one or more years. Most studies (93%) focused on antecedents of engagement rather than outcomes of engagement (38%). Data were commonly collected using self-report questionnaires (87%) and analyzed using path, growth, and cross-lagged models. Studies mainly examined engagement in classroom activities, school, or schoolwork; and focused on behavioral engagement (70%), followed by emotional (61%), then cognitive engagement (35%).

Psychological Reactivity to Daily Family Experiences During Adolescence: Individual Differences and Developmental Stability	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The current study examined adolescent psychological reactivity to daily family experiences, an important feature of emotion regulation that could have significant implications for psychopathology. A total of 428 Mexican-heritage adolescents (M-age = 15.02 years, range: 13-18 years) completed daily diary checklists for 14 days and again 1 year later. Results revealed that adolescents' family experiences were associated with negative mood, positive mood, and role fulfillment on a daily basis. Only role fulfillment reactivity was stable across 1 year, suggesting instability in individual differences in positive and negative mood reactivity. Sex moderated the relation between positive and negative mood reactivity during the second year of study, with males exhibiting broad psychological reactivity to daily family experiences. However, females who experienced higher negative mood reactivity exhibited less positive mood reactivity. Implications for possible sex differences in depression risk during the high school years are discussed.

The sample included primarily low-socioeconomic students of color attending urban middle schools (n = 2,629; 10-16 years of age). Longitudinal data were collected at four time points across two years. We used hierarchical linear modeling to model change in purpose. On average, purpose declined over time. We also identified several predictors of intercept and slope. For example, Black youth had a higher average purpose intercept, as well as a steeper average decline than other racial/ethnic groups. Females demonstrated a higher average purpose intercept than males, but this effect disappeared when academic achievement was added to the model.

Substance-related peer information sharing is a relatively understudied phenomenon, particularly in street-involved youth. We recruited 84 youth from a community drop-in center to complete a survey assessing substance use and peer influence on drug use. A subset of youth completed a semi-structured interview assessing factors related to peer information sharing around drug use. Results showed that peer influence was highly relevant to drug use patterns in street-involved youth.

The Intensity Effect in Adolescent Close Friendships: Implications for Aggressive and Depressive Symptomatology	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined the effect of close friendship intensity as a potential amplifier of an adolescent's preexisting tendencies toward depressive and aggressive symptoms. A diverse community sample of 170 adolescents and their closest friends was assessed via multiple methods, and adolescents were followed from age 16 to 17. Results supported the hypothesized effect, with more intense close friendships interacting with higher baseline levels of behavioral symptoms to predict greater relative increases in symptoms over time. Effects were observed for both depressive and aggressive symptoms, and appeared with respect to multiple observational measures of friendship intensity. Findings are interpreted as suggesting that seemingly disparate phenomena (e.g., co-rumination for depression and deviancy-training for aggression) may both be dependent upon the intensity of the adolescent's social connections.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				MAR	2020	30	1					158	169		10.1111/jora.12508	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12508								31135080					WOS:000516654100011

Relational Victimization and Telomere Length in Adolescent Girls	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												An emerging body of research suggests that telomere length (TL)-a measure of cellular aging-is inversely associated with experiences of childhood stress. Given the salience of peer relationships in childhood and adolescence, we tested whether relational victimization is a unique and specific predictor of salivary TL in girls. Results examining 122 girls (ages 9-15) revealed that greater relational victimization was related to shorter TL but that similar associations were not evident for other measures of social relationships nor accounted for by factors related to depression, life stress, or 5-HTTLPR genotype. The present findings suggest that relational victimization is uniquely associated with TL in adolescence, revealing a link between key aspects of social relationships and biological processes.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JAN	2020	30			1			39	45		10.1111/jora.12447	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12447								30133038					WOS:000508756700003

Family relationships within the family unit are a stronger predictor of adolescents' development than the particular family structure. Transitions in families that result in notable reductions in effective parenting practices and economic well-being will negatively affect youth, regardless of family structure. Family processes that promote optimal growth and development among youth in traditional two-parent, heterosexual households work similarly for those growing up in nontraditional family structures.

Victimization, Aggression, and Other Problem Behaviors: Trajectories of Change Within and Across Middle School Grades	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined trajectories of victimization and problem behaviors within and across three grades of middle school. Participants were 2,166 adolescents from three urban middle schools in the United States who completed measures of victimization, physical and relational aggression, substance use, and delinquent behavior. Latent curve analyses modeled changes in each construct across 12 waves collected every 3 months. In each case, the best-fitting model required separate linear slopes to represent changes within each grade and a factor representing decreases in the summers. Positive cross-construct correlations were found for intercepts, linear slopes, and measures within waves.

Longitudinal Transmission of Conflict Management Styles Across Inter-Parental and Adolescent Relationships	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study longitudinally investigated transmission of conflict management styles across inter-parental, adolescent-parent, adolescent-friend, and adolescent-partner relationships. During four waves, 799 middle-to-late adolescents (Mage-t1=15.80; 54% boys) and their parents completed the Conflict Resolution Style Inventory. Cross-lagged path analyses indicated transmission of adolescent conflict management styles in relationships with parents to relationships with friends and romantic partners: Positive problem solving and conflict engagement utilized by adolescents in conflicts with parents were significantly, positively related to, respectively, adolescent positive problem solving and conflict engagement in relationships with friends 1year later and relationships with partners 2years later. Thus, the study showed that the way adolescents manage conflicts with parents predicts how they handle conflicts later in relationships outside the family.

Using an Acculturation-Stress-Resilience Framework to Explore Latent Profiles of Latina/o Language Brokers	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												With survey data from 243 Latina/o early adolescent language brokers, latent profile analyses were conducted to identify different types (i.e., profiles) of brokers. Profiles were based on how often Latina/o early adolescents brokered for family members, as well as their levels of family-based acculturation stress, negative brokering beliefs, parentification, and positive brokering beliefs. Three brokering profiles emerged: (1) infrequent-ambivalents, (2) occasional-moderates, and (3) parentified-endorsers. Profile membership was significantly predicted by ethnic identification and brokering in a medical context. Respect, brokering at school, and brokering at home did not significantly predict profile membership. In addition, parentified-endorsers had more frequent perceived ethnic/racial discrimination and depressive symptoms than other profiles. In contrast, infrequent-ambivalents engaged in risky behaviors less frequently than other profiles.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				DEC	2017	27	4					842	861		10.1111/jora.12318	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12318								29152863					WOS:000415897400009

Overt and Relational Aggression Participant Role Behavior: Measurement and Relations With Sociometric Status and Depression	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study is the first to measure participant role behavior across overt and relational forms of aggression. The Overt and Relational Aggression Participant Role Behavior Scales were designed to measure aggression, assisting, reinforcing, defending, victimization, and outsider behavior during acts of peer aggression in an ethnically diverse sample of 609 adolescents (M age=12years). The data fit the hypothesized 12-factor model, and measurement invariance was established across gender. Relational victimization, but not overt victimization, was positively associated with all other relational aggression roles. Each participant role subscale was positively associated with depressive symptoms with the exception of the overt and relational outsider subscales. Future research and intervention efforts should consider overt and relational aggression participant roles, separately.

Participants listed their friends in sixth grade and whether each nominated friend was the same or a different ethnic group. They also reported on their ethnic identity, intergroup relations, and perceived school safety. Results showed that same-ethnic friendships were related to stronger ethnic identity and interracial friendships were uniquely related to school safety. Interethnic friendships (an Asian friend from a different country of origin) when perceived as same ethnic functioned similarly to same-ethnic friendships, whereas interethnic friendships perceived as from a different ethnic group, like interracial friendships, were associated with better intergroup relations. Implications for studying friendships in ethnically diverse samples are discussed.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				SEP	2017	27	3					705	713		10.1111/jora.12309	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12309								28776839					WOS:000407225100017

Associations Between Victimization and Adolescents' Self-Reported Responses to Peer Provocation Are Moderated by Peer-Reported Aggressiveness	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Many early adolescents experience peer victimization, but little research has examined how they respond to aggression by peers. Thus, in a large sample of early adolescents (N=648; M age=12.96; SD=0.30; 52.0% female), we examined (1) the associations between peer-reported victimization and self-reported responses to peer provocation, and (2) whether these associations were moderated by peer-reported aggression. In particular, we predicted that the reported use of assertion, a strategy generally viewed as socially skillful, would be associated with less victimization, but only for youth low on peer-reported aggression. Results were consistent with this hypothesis. Moreover, seeking adult intervention was associated with greater victimization for youth high on peer-reported aggression. Implications for research and practice are discussed.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2017	27	2					436	451		10.1111/jora.12282	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12282								28876519					WOS:000401163500012

On average, family conflict decreased linearly as adolescents aged. Families with an alcoholic parent demonstrated higher adolescent-reported family conflict and this effect was partially mediated by higher mother- and father-reported marital dissatisfaction. Families with higher marital dissatisfaction had greater conflict when adolescents were young (based on fathers' marital dissatisfaction) and as they aged (based on mother's marital dissatisfaction). Years in which mothers reported higher marital dissatisfaction than usual coincided with years in which adolescents reported greater family conflict. Results indicate that marital dissatisfaction has both within and between-family effects on adolescent perceptions of conflict.

Unauthorized Status and Youth Development in the United States: Consensus Statement of the Society for Research on Adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												In the United States, 5.3 million children and adolescents are growing up either with unauthorized status or with at least one parent who has that status. Until recently, little in the way of research has informed federal, state, and local policy debates related to unauthorized status (e.g., border enforcement, deportation, and a pathway to citizenship) although these issues have important implications for youth development. This statement is a brief summary of the research evidence on multiple domains of development that may be affected by the child or parent's unauthorized status. We also describe the contextual and psychological mechanisms that may link this status to developmental outcomes. We summarize a range of policies and practices that could reduce the developmental harm to children, youth, and their families stemming from this status. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for policy, practice, and research that are based on the evidence reviewed.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				MAR	2017	27	1					4	19		10.1111/jora.12272	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12272								28498536					WOS:000394985000001

Attachment to school is important in this population given the high level of school dropout rates of Mexican-origin students. Results indicated that, on average, school attachment from fifth to sixth grade remains stable, but declines from sixth to eighth grade. Boys had lower levels of school attachment at fifth grade but followed similar patterns of change as girls did. Attachment to teachers, peer competence, school aspirations and expectations, and substance-use cognitions emerged as longitudinal outcomes of level or changes in school attachment. Gender moderated associations of school attachment.

Parental Provision of Academic Structure and the Transition to Middle School	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined parents' provision of academic structure, and whether they implement it in an autonomy supportive or controlling manner, in relation to children's competence-related beliefs, motivation, and academic behavior over the transition to middle school. Interviews with 160 sixth-grade children were coded on parental structure and autonomy support. Children reported on their competence-related beliefs, motivation, and engagement in sixth and seventh grades. Regression analyses showed that higher structure predicted seventh-grade perceived competence, intrinsic motivation, engagement, and English grades, controlling for these same outcomes at sixth grade. Autonomy support predicted perceived competence, autonomous motivation, and English grades, controlling for prior outcomes. Structural equation models indicated that relations between structure and engagement and between autonomy support and grades were mediated by perceived competence.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				DEC	2015	25	4					668	684		10.1111/jora.12161	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12161													WOS:000363776800007

The degree to which others in the environment perceive such prejudiceregardless of adolescents' own perceptionsalso matters by shedding light on the contextual climate in which adolescents spend their daily lives. Drawing on the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study revealed that school-wide perceptions of peer prejudice, which tap into the interpersonal climate of schools, appeared to be particularly risky for adolescents' academic achievement. In contrast, adolescents' own perceptions of peer prejudice at schools were associated with their feelings of alienation in school. Importantly, these patterns did not vary substantially by several markers of vulnerability to social stigmatization.

Group members' discussions about hypothetical dilemmas were coded for agreements, disagreements, commands, and opinions. Interactions during a hypothetical decision were rated for openness, dominance, aggression, and prosocial behavior. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed that higher within-group status predicted more disagreements, commands, and less openness than lower within-group status. Interactions showed that prosocial and aggressive behavior varied as a function of individual status in low-status but not high-status groups. Boys, but not girls, engaged in more openness in higher status groups. Results provide insights into peer socialization.

Surveys were administered to a diverse sample of 683 1517-years-old adolescents in the spring of 2007 and again in the spring of 2008. Results indicated that paternal problem drinking directly predicted substance use (alcohol and drug use) for boys, but not for girls. In contrast, maternal problem drinking directly predicted substance use (drug use) for girls, but not for boys. Adolescentparent communication also mediated the relationship between parental problem drinking and psychosocial adjustment for girls, but not for boys. These gender differences highlight the need to consider both the gender of the adolescent and the parent when examining parental problem drinking and adolescent adjustment.																			1050-8392						2012	22	3					498	511		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2012.00791.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2012.00791.x													WOS:000307546700010

Adolescents discussed factors salient to their involvement in focus groups, as well as factors that may influence involvement in a longitudinal study. At the outset of the focus groups, adolescents had a positive view of research, but were reluctant to engage in research that involved biologic samples.

Friendship-Level Predictors of Unstructured and Unsupervised Socializing in Adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Companions are central to explanations of the risky nature of unstructured and unsupervised socializing, yet we know little about whom adolescents are with when hanging out. We examine predictors of how often friendship dyads hang out via multilevel analyses of longitudinal friendship-level data on over 5,000 middle schoolers. Adolescents hang out most with their most available friends and their most generally similar friends, not with their most at-risk or similarly at-risk friends. These findings vary little by gender and wave. Together, the findings suggest that the risks of hanging out stem from the nature of hanging out as an activity, not the nature of adolescents' companions, and that hanging out is a context for friends' mutual reinforcement of preexisting characteristics.

Temporal Relationships Among Depressive Symptoms, Risky Behavior Engagement, Perceived Control, and Gender in a Sample of Adolescents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The goals of the study were to examine whether (a) risky behaviors precede depressive symptoms or, conversely, depressive symptoms predict risky behavior engagement; (b) gender moderates the relationship between risky behavior engagement and depressive symptoms; and (c) perceived control strengthens the association between risky behavior engagement and depressive symptoms. At Time 1, 118 adolescents completed self-report measures assessing perceived control, risky behavior engagement, and depressive symptoms. Follow-up assessments occurred every 6 weeks (Times 2-5), and participants completed measures assessing risky behavior engagement and depressive symptoms. Results indicated that neither risky behavior engagement nor depressive symptoms emerged as main effects for the sample as a whole. When examining the relationship between depressive symptoms and risky behavior engagement as a function of gender, boys', but not girls', risky behavior engagement predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms. Irrespective of whether we examined boys or girls, depressive symptoms did not predict risky behavior engagement. With regards to the role of cognitive vulnerability, adolescents with lower levels of perceived control reported higher levels of depressive symptoms following risky behavior engagement. These findings suggest that both gender and cognitive vulnerability factors may potentiate the relationship between risky behavior engagement and subsequent depressive symptoms.

We test hypotheses concerning the development of these beliefs in adolescence. Based on surveys of 1,535 adolescents collected over 2 years, we find that middle and late adolescents had significantly lower levels of trust than early adolescents and that these beliefs became more stable and less related to interpersonal trust between early and late adolescence. Results of multiple group structural equation models revealed that, regardless of age, adolescents' reports that a strong sense of student solidarity characterized their school significantly increased social trust at T2, controlling for levels at T1, and opportunities to exchange perspectives with fellow students increased social trust at T2 indirectly, through feelings of student solidarity. The study points to the role of schools in nurturing the democratic dispositions of younger generations.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2010	20	3					748	773		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00658.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00658.x								20936077					WOS:000280995500010

The Important People Interview (IPI) differentiated attachment bonds from other supportive or affiliative relationships and indicated that adolescents show a hierarchical ordering of preferences for multiple attachment figures. Differences in the composition and structure of adolescents' attachment hierarchies were found between the early high school (9th and 10th grades), later high school (11th and 12th grades), and college samples. In the college sample, romantic partners were placed in higher positions in adolescents' hierarchies, fathers were placed in lower positions, and the structure of adolescents' hierarchies were less differentiated than in the high school samples. Individual differences in the composition of adolescents' hierarchies were associated with adjustment outcomes. Friends' placement in higher positions and fathers' exclusion from or placement in quaternary positions was associated with increased behavior problems. Findings demonstrate that the IPI provides a measure of adolescents' attachment hierarchies that is sensitive to developmental stage and individual differences.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2010	20	3					678	706		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00655.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00655.x								22545000					WOS:000280995500007

Reciprocal effects were found between parent-child relations and on-time maturing boys and girls' cigarette and alcohol use, after estimating stability in these constructs across time. Parent-child relationship quality was associated with increased alcohol use 12 months later for early maturing girls. Cigarette and alcohol use were associated with increased problems in the parent-child relationship for late maturing girls. No effects were observed for early and late maturing boys in the pathways between parent-child relationship quality and substance use. Pubertal timing moderated the pathway linking parent-child relationship quality with cigarette use 1 year later such that the association was stronger for late maturing girls compared with early and on-time maturing girls. The findings indicate interplay between the psychosocial aspects of maturation, family relationships, and adolescent substance use and highlight possible gender-specific influences.

High school seniors (N=183) who lived with married parents completed questionnaires about their parents' marriage and their own romantic relationships. A subset of 88 adolescents was also observed interacting with their romantic partners. Adolescents' perceptions and appraisals of interparental conflict were related to the amount of conflict in romantic relationship and adolescents' conflict styles. Adolescents' appraisals of interparental conflict (i.e., self-blame, perceived threat) moderated many of the associations between interparental conflict and conflict behavior with romantic partners. The patterns of moderated effects differed by gender. These findings suggest that the meanings boys and girls ascribe to interparental conflict are important for understanding how family experiences contribute to the development of romantic relationships.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2010	20	1					188	209		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00635.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00635.x								20186259					WOS:000274701000010
J	Bohnert, AM; Martin, NC; Garber, J				Bohnert, Amy M.; Martin, Nina C.; Garber, Judy			Predicting adolescents' organized activity involvement: The role of maternal depression history, family relationship quality, and adolescent cognitions	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Although the potential benefits of organized activity involvement during high school have been documented, little is known about what familial and individual characteristics are associated with higher levels of participation. Using structural equation modeling, this longitudinal study examined the extent to which maternal depression history (i.e., risk), family relationship quality, and adolescents' cognitions (i.e., self-worth and attributional style), predicted organized activity involvement during high school among 145 adolescents, controlling for socioeconomic status and adolescent depressive symptoms. Results showed that risk predicted less adolescent high school activity involvement, and this relation was mediated by family relationship quality. Family relationship quality indirectly affected activity involvement through adolescent cognitions. The overall predictive model generally supported the importance of the interplay between family and individual factors in predicting activity involvement during high school.

J	Brown, BB				Brown, BB			Moving forward with research on adolescence:: Some reflections on the state of <i>JRA</i> and the state of the field	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Over the past 5 years the scientific study of adolescence has continued to grow in volume and sophistication. Drawing on recent articles published in the Journal of Research on Adolescence, I take this opportunity to comment on some common understandings about the nature of adolescent development and behavior, recurrent tensions in the research, and promising directions or special challenges for future investigations. The journal also has changed in significant ways over this period, thanks to the outstanding contributions of scholars and journal/publisher support staff.

This study used a longitudinal, community sample of adolescents who reported suicidal ideation repeatedly over 7 years to examine suicidal ideation trends. We hypothesized that a mid-adolescence peak in ideation is limited to adolescents exposed to friends' or family members' suicidality. Ideation trends were compared across groups exposed and not exposed to others' suicidality and statistically assessed using growth curve analyses. Overall, ideation rates peaked at age 15 years. Group comparisons revealed that the peak was limited to adolescents whose parents reported suicidality.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2005	15	2					205	222		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2005.00092.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2005.00092.x													WOS:000228750800004

Most analyses are based on a sample of 724 relationship pairs. The sample was ethnically diverse: 56% White, 20% Black, 14% Hispanic, and 10% Asian, Pacific Islander, or Other. Male partners on average were 17.5 years in age and females were 17.0. Predictors of intercourse included virginity status when entering the relationships, desire to have sex early in relationships, family- and school-related risk indicators, attitudes regarding the pros and cons of having sex, and other risk indicators, such as delinquency and drinking. Findings demonstrate that the characteristics of both sexes influence intercourse occurrence within relationships.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2003	13	1					81	112																WOS:000181454500004
J	Griesler, PC; Kandel, DB; Davies, M				Griesler, PC; Kandel, DB; Davies, M			Maternal smoking in pregnancy, child behavior problems, and adolescent smoking	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												We previously reported that maternal prenatal smoking had a significant effect on adolescent daughters' smoking, especially current smoking. Using a longitudinal sample of 187 mother-child dyads, we examine the role of child behavior problems in potentially explaining this effect. Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with higher levels of child behavior problems, particularly among girls. Childhood behavior problems increase the likelihood of lifetime smoking among daughters but do not explain the effect of prenatal maternal smoking on their current smoking. Maternal smoking in pregnancy, especially heavy use of a pack or more a day, retains a unique effect on girls' current smoking with controls for current maternal smoking, child behavior problems, and maternal monitoring of the child. The effect of maternal prenatal smoking is suggestive of a biological component, which may have direct or indirect influences on adolescent smoking. The small number of cases in the study calls for the replication of these findings in large samples that would incorporate prospective measures of prenatal nicotine exposure from mo ther and fa ther and additional biological and psychosocial covariates. Implications for understanding the risk factors for adolescent smoking are discussed.																			1050-8392						1998	8	2					159	185		10.1207/s15327795jra0802_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0802_1													WOS:000074600200001

To address these questions a community-based sample of 172 adolescents was studied twice: as teenagers aged 13-18 years, and approximately 6 years later as young adults aged 19-25. At both Time 1 and Time 2 each parent completed a measure of marital satisfaction and their adolescents completed self-ratings of emotional and physical health. At Time 1 adolescents completed three rating scales related to family closeness or cohesion, and at Time 2 they rated how close they felt to their mothers and to their fathers. Correlational and regression analyses revealed the following: (a) over a 6-year interval, the marital satisfaction of mothers was somewhat better than that of fathers in predicting the subsequent emotional and physical health of young adults; (b) parents' marital satisfaction assessed when offspring were adolescents predicted young adult outcomes better than contemporaneous associations at either Time 1 or Time 2; (c) although family closeness or cohesion served as a mediator for some outcomes, direct paths remained between marital satisfaction and young adult outcomes.																			1050-8392						1997	7	1					55	80		10.1207/s15327795jra0701_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0701_4													WOS:A1997WB42800004

Adolescents in dual-earner families reported on parent-adolescent relations and their own problem behavior. Their parents provided reports of work overload, levels of stress, and parent-adolescent relations. Regression analyses revealed some support for a spillover model, but the mediators differed for mothers and fathers. That is, mother acceptance mediated the link between her work overload and changes in adolescent problem behavior over a 6-month period, whereas parent-adolescent conflict mediated the link between fathers' work overload and adolescent problem behavior. An examination of mothers and fathers together suggested that parent-adolescent conflict was highest when both parents were stressed. Moreover, mother acceptance appeared to buffer the link between parent-adolescent conflict and adolescent problem behavior. Future research should examine different qualities of parent-adolescent relations when considering the potential impact of parents' work on adolescent behavior, and should include data from both parents when possible.																			1050-8392						1995	5	2					201	223		10.1207/s15327795jra0502_3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0502_3													WOS:A1995QP78400003

It is less clear whether household chaos is linked to elevated risk for behavior problems in adolescence. The aims of this study were 3fold: (1) characterize the variability of adolescent and caregiver reports of household chaos over time; (2) examine associations among caregiver and adolescent reports of chaos over a 9-month period; (3) consider how between- and within- individual variability in household chaos predicts adolescent externalizing and internalizing problems. This study drew data from the Family Income Dynamics study, a 9-month longitudinal study. Participants included 104 adolescents between 14 and 16 years old (55% female; M age = 14.85) and their caregiver (92% female) from low- and middle-income families. Results showed that adolescent-reports of household chaos were more variable over time compared to caregivers' reports. Adolescent-reports of household chaos had positive within- and between-level associations with externalizing problems and between-level associations with internalizing, while caregiver-reports of chaos had no links to behavior. This work highlights the importance of adolescents' own perceptions of household chaos when considering its links to adolescent development.					; Hanson, Jamie/B-9420-2014	Hunter-Rue, Daniesha S./0000-0003-3553-7265; Miller, Portia/0000-0003-0021-3690; Hanson, Jamie/0000-0002-0469-8886													1050-8392	1532-7795				2024 AUG 29	2024										10.1111/jora.13016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.13016		AUG 2024						39210556					WOS:001300279300001

Proactive coping with discrimination: A mediator between ethnic-racial socialization and Latinx youth's internalizing symptoms	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												There is a dearth of knowledge in the coping literature on how minoritized youth cope with racism-related stressors and the predictors of effective coping responses. This two-wave study examined the direct and indirect effects of ethnic-racial socialization on depressive and anxiety symptoms via proactive coping with discrimination in a community sample of 135 Latinx adolescents (M-age = 16, SD = 1.27; 59% female). Results indicate that cultural socialization was related to higher use of proactive coping with discrimination 6 months later, which in turn, was related to fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms.

The Longitudinal Link Between Popularity, Likeability, Fear of Negative Evaluation and Social Avoidance Across Adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study investigated the longitudinal bidirectional associations between likeability, popularity, fear of negative evaluation, and social avoidance, to aid in preventing the negative consequences and persistent trajectories of low social status and heightened social anxiety. In total, 1741 adolescents in grades 7-9 participated at 3 yearly waves. A self-report questionnaire measured fear of negative evaluation. Peer nominations assessed likeability, popularity, and social avoidance. Lower popularity predicted more avoidance, and vice versa. More avoidance was related to lower likeability over time. Being less popular and/or more liked by peers, increased fear of negative evaluation. Support for a transactional model between social anxiety and social status was found, but distinguishing different social status and social anxiety components is necessary.					van den Berg, Yvonne/E-3320-2012; Becker, Eni/A-2668-2010; Cillessen, Antonius/A-5978-2010; Lange, Wolf-Gero/D-6128-2012														1050-8392	1532-7795				SEP	2023	33	3					720	734		10.1111/jora.12833	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12833		FEB 2023						36724545					WOS:000924676800001

Participants were convenient cross-sectional/normative (Study 1) and clinical/longitudinal (Study 2) samples of Italian parents whose children were in middle childhood and adolescence. In Study 1, self-reported socialization strategies, youths' maladjustment, and emotion dysregulation increased since the pandemic began. Whereas, in Study 2, socialization strategies and youths' maladjustment decreased since the pandemic started. In both studies, unsupportive parental emotion socialization predicted youths' maladjustment and emotion dysregulation, while supportive parental emotion socialization predicted adaptive emotion regulation.

Results indicated that sexual orientation disclosure to classmates was associated with higher levels of sexual orientation-based victimization, which contributed to higher levels of internalized homonegativity, which ultimately contributed to higher levels of depressive symptoms and lower self-esteem. Sexual orientation-based victimization and internalized homonegativity were positively associated with depressive symptoms and negatively associated with self-esteem but sexual orientation disclosure to classmates was only positively associated with depressive symptoms. Associations between sexual orientation-based victimization and internalized homonegativity were stronger among college Latinx SMY compared to SMY in high school.

Black youth committed fewer offenses prior to arrest than White youth, Black and Latino youth were more likely to be formally processed, and Black youth were most likely to be rearrested (even controlling for postbaseline offending), highlighting that minority youth are overrepresented in the juvenile justice system despite similar or lower levels of criminal behavior.					; Baker, Amanda/HHN-7545-2022	Padgaonkar, Namita Tanya/0000-0003-2543-0325; Frick, Paul/0000-0001-7335-1299; Baker, Amanda/0000-0002-0140-2162													1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2021	31	2					317	334		10.1111/jora.12599	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12599		DEC 2020						33280192					WOS:000595714800001

Using data from the longitudinal Crossroads study, the present study assessed whether life expectancy mediates the association between neighborhood disorder and risk-taking-substance use, crime, and risky sex-among 1,093 justice-involved adolescents. Results indicate that neighborhood disorder was linked to lower estimated life expectancy which in turn related to higher rates of cigarette use, binge drinking, illicit drug use, offending, and casual sex. However, life expectancy did not explain the association between neighborhood disorder and marijuana use or inconsistent condom use.

Stepfamily Processes and Youth Adjustment: The Role of Perceived Neighborhood Collective Efficacy	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Using a representative sample from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health and a recently developed stepfamily-process typology, this study explores three plausible functions of perceived neighborhood collective efficacy with respect to stepfamily life and youth adjustment: an ability to (1) prevent maladaptive patterns of stepfamily processes, (2) promote stepchildren's adjustment beyond the influence of stepfamily processes, and (3) protect stepchildren's adjustment when faced with maladaptive patterns of stepfamily processes. The results indicate that higher levels of perceived neighborhood collective efficacy are associated with more adaptive stepfamily processes and higher levels of youth self-esteem over time, net the influence of stepfamily processes.

J	El Mallah, S				El Mallah, Shereen			Conceptualization and Measurement of Adolescent Prosocial Behavior: Looking Back and Moving Forward	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The struggle to cast a net around the numerous ways prosocial behavior is expressed lends itself to the absence of widely accepted methods of measurement. Additionally, research intent on evaluating the psychometric properties of current approaches has been somewhat limited. Weaving together seminal as well as contemporary research, the current review focuses on how these conceptual and measurement issues pertain to adolescent studies (in an intentional effort to offset the somewhat disproportionate focus directed toward prosocial development in infants, children, and adults). Recommendations to address current limitations and attain a more nuanced understanding of the construct are presented and discussed.

Instagrowth: A Longitudinal Growth Mixture Model of Social Media Time Use Across Adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined differential patterns of time spent using social media in a sample of 457 adolescents over a 6-year period. The majority of adolescents (83%), termed moderate users, reported steady social media use over time. A second group (increasers: 12%) reported low social media use that increased gradually and ended high at the end of the study. A third group, called peak users (6%), reported low social media that increased quickly after a few years and then returned to baseline levels. Low self-regulation predicted being an increaser or peak user. Being a moderate user tended to be related to lower levels of depression, aggression, delinquency, social media problems, and cyberbullying across time, as compared with the other groups.

Differences in Internalizing Symptoms Anticipate Adolescent Friendship Dissolution	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined the degree to which internalizing symptoms predict adolescent friendship instability. A total of 397 adolescents identified 499 same-sex reciprocated friendships that originated in the seventh grade (M = 13.18 years). Discrete-time survival analyses were conducted with Grade 7 peer, teacher, and self-reports of internalizing symptoms as predictors of friendship dissolution across Grades 8-12. Differences between friends in depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and (for boys only) submissiveness predicted subsequent friendship dissolution. Individual levels of these variables did not predict friendship dissolution, even at extreme or clinical levels. The findings suggest that friendship instability arising from internalizing problems stems from dissimilarity between friends rather than the presence of psychopathological symptoms on the part of one friend.

Sexual Development in Adolescence: An Examination of Genetic and Environmental Influences	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Sexual development entails many experiences and is a major feature of adolescence. Most relevant behavioral genetic studies, however, focus primarily on sexual behaviors associated with health risks. We took a more normative, developmental perspective by examining genetic and environmental influences on five sexual behaviors ranging from dating to pregnancy in middle (M-age = 14.90 years) and late adolescence (M-age = 17.85 years) in a sample of twins (N = 3,762). Overall, behaviors that are more common and socially sanctioned (e.g., dating) were more heritable than behaviors that are less common and socially acceptable (e.g., sexual intercourse). That the etiology of different sexual behaviors is tied to their normativeness highlights the importance of considering the broader developmental context when studying sexual development.

The Roles of Emotion Regulation and Executive Function	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Existing literature has demonstrated an association between higher adolescent religiousness and lower risk-taking via higher self-regulation. This study sought to elucidate the roles of emotion regulation and executive function as parallel mediators in the link between religiousness and risk-taking in a sample of 167 adolescents (mean age = 14.13 years, 52% male, 82% White at Time 1). Longitudinal results across three waves utilizing structural equation modeling indicated higher religiousness was associated with higher emotion regulation, whereas religiousness was not associated with executive function. Subsequently, higher emotion regulation and executive function were associated with lower risk-taking. Emotion regulation mediated the association between religiousness and risk-taking. The findings highlight religiousness as a contextual protective factor for adolescents.

Latent Profiles of Discrimination and Socialization Predicting Ethnic Identity and Well-Being Among Asian American Adolescents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Ethnic identity is rooted in sociocultural processes, but little is known about how social interactions predict its longitudinal changes. Using data from 154 Asian American adolescents, latent profile analysis derived four typologies based on unfair treatment (i.e., discrimination, model minority stereotyping) and ethnic socialization (i.e., cultural socialization, preparation for bias, promotion of mistrust): Low Cultural Salience, High Cultural Salience with Marginalization, Culturally Prepared with Low Mistrust, and High Mistrust/Discrimination. Few gender or generational differences in profile membership were found. Positive outcomes were linked to adolescents attuned to both positive and negative experiences, Culturally Prepared with Low Mistrust, who reported increases in ethnic belonging and decreases in negative emotions.

Do Hostile School Environments Promote Social Deviance by Shaping Neural Responses to Social Exclusion?	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The present study examined adolescents' neural responses to social exclusion as a mediator of past exposure to a hostile school environment (HSE) and later social deviance, and whether family connectedness buffered these associations. Participants (166 Mexican-origin adolescents, 54.4% female) reported on their HSE exposure and family connectedness across Grades 9-11. Six months later, neural responses to social exclusion were measured. Finally, social deviance was self-reported in Grades 9 and 12. The HSE-social deviance link was mediated by greater reactivity to social deviance in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, a region from the social pain network also implicated in social susceptibility. However, youths with stronger family bonds were protected from this neurobiologically mediated path. These findings suggest a complex interplay of risk and protective factors that impact adolescent behavior through the brain.

Using data from the NICHD SECCYD (N=958; Mage=15.07, SD=0.18), this study examined the effects of cognitive control, reward seeking, and their interaction on sexual behavior. Results of structural equationmodels revealed that performance on behavioral tasks assessing reward seeking and cognitive control uniquely predicted sexual intercourse, but the interaction between them was not significant. For oral sex, only cognitive control was a significant predictor. The findings provide additional support for the dual systems model, and suggest that reward seeking and cognitive control make unique contributions to adolescent sexual behavior.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				DEC	2017	27	4					907	913		10.1111/jora.12321	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12321								29152861					WOS:000415897400013

Associations Between School Connection and Depressive Symptoms From Adolescence Through Early Adulthood: Moderation by Early Adversity	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Depressive symptomatology is one of the most common and costly threats to American mental health, making the elucidation of environmental influences on depressive symptoms particularly important. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study explores the interaction between environmental risk and protective factors in the etiology of depressive symptoms by asking whether school connection is associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms through early adulthood, and whether connection serves as a protective or promotive factor for youth who experienced early adversity. Findings highlight the importance of school connection in promoting long-term mental health for all youth and suggest that policies and practice supporting school connection may be effective intervention strategies for youth at risk for depressive symptomatology.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2017	27	2					298	311		10.1111/jora.12275	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12275								28876520					WOS:000401163500003

Undermining Adolescent Autonomy With Parents and Peers: The Enduring Implications of Psychologically Controlling Parenting	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study used a longitudinal, multimethod design to examine whether teens' perceptions of maternal psychological control predicted lower levels of adolescent autonomy displayed with their mothers and peers over time. Significant predictions from teens' perceptions of maternal psychological control to teens' displays of autonomy in maternal and peer relationships were found at age 16 after accounting for adolescent displays of autonomy with mothers and peers at age 13, indicating relative changes in teens' autonomy displayed with their mother and a close peer over time. Results suggest that the ability to assert one's autonomy in mid-adolescence may be influenced by maternal behavior early in adolescence, highlighting the importance of parents minimizing psychological control to facilitate autonomy development for teens.

Participants included 624 adolescents (319 females and 305 males) from an urban school in Changsha (n=308) and from a rural school in Liuyang (n=316). Findings showed that self-perceived academic competence was negatively associated with prospective depressive and anxiety symptoms. Meanwhile, adolescents with low levels of self-perceived social competence were at heightened risk for depressive symptoms during times of increased stressors (supporting a vulnerability-stress model).

High openness in communication and stronger disclosure self-efficacy beliefs were associated with more disclosure at follow-up. Although a positive relationship was also found for maternal warmth/responsiveness when it was considered together with other parenting attributes, its unique contribution to the disclosure process was attenuated once openness and self-efficacy beliefs were taken into account. Domain-specific predictors of disclosure were also explored. Open communication was important for disclosure across all domains, while self-efficacy beliefs were critical for revealing difficult information. These findings underscore the importance of fostering an open environment in families that nurtures adolescents' confidence to engage in disclosure with parents.

A description is emerging of how peer relations develop. Surprisingly, though, we know less about why peer relations develop as they do. Experimental designs provide opportunities to learn about causal processes in peer relations, yet they have not been used frequently in this field. The aim of this paper is to encourage greater use of experimental designs to unravel causal processes that shape the development of peer relations. To this end, limitations of causal inferences from longitudinal studies are presented, it is demonstrated how experimental designs and experiments nested in longitudinal studies can be used to test causal mechanisms, and intervention trials as real-life experiments are discussed.

Approximately 75% of respondents indicated that parents were moderately to fully accepting at time of disclosure. Approximately 15% said their parents were fully or almost fully rejecting at time of disclosure, with about half eventually becoming more accepting. Perceived parental acceptance of gay and lesbian children, but not bisexual daughters, improved over time. Increased parental acceptance was attributed to multiple factors including repeated adolescent-initiated conversations about sexual identity, parental exposure to LGB individuals, and parental love and commitment to the relationship.

Interviews were conducted with ethnically diverse youth, parents, and adult leaders from four programs for high school-aged teens. Analysis suggested that youth develop responsibility through a four-step cycle: (1) voluntarily taking on roles and obligations, (2) experiencing challenge and strain, (3) being motivated to fulfill their obligations, and (4) internalizing a self-concept that leads to responsible behavior in other contexts. Leaders support this learning cycle by creating program structures and providing ongoing support that helps youth experience ownership of demanding roles. Peers contribute by providing a sense of solidarity while also imposing mutual accountability.

Peer Victimization and Internalizing Symptoms From Adolescence Into Young Adulthood: Building Strength Through Emotional Support	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This longitudinal study investigated how changes in peer victimization were associated with changes in internalizing symptoms among 662 adolescents across a 4-year period. The moderating effects of initial levels of father, mother, and friend emotional support on this association were also examined. Gender and age group differences (early adolescent group aged 1215years; late adolescent group aged 1618years) were tested. Increases in physical and relational victimization were related to increases in internalizing symptoms.

Socioeconomic Context and Emotional-Behavioral Achievement Links: Concurrent and Prospective Associations Among Low- and High-Income Youth	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Temporal associations in the relationship between emotional-behavioral difficulty and academic achievement were explored in 2 samples followed from 6th through 8th grade. The first sample comprised 280 students entering an economically disadvantaged urban middle school and the second comprised 318 students entering an affluent suburban middle school. Among disadvantaged youth, emotional indices were concurrently associated with poorer achievement while prospective associations between substance use and achievement were evident. For privileged adolescents, only a significant concurrent relationship emerged between social anxiety and achievement, although nonsignificant trends in the data suggest other, albeit weak, associations. The findings are discussed in terms of similarities and differences in these temporal associations across 2 samples representing extremes of the socioeconomic continuum.																			1050-8392						2012	22	1					14	30		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2011.00747.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2011.00747.x								23129975					WOS:000300680500003

Condom Use Trajectories in Adolescence and the Transition to Adulthood: The Role of Mother and Father Support	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Few studies have investigated how mother and father support differ on predicting youths sexual risk behavior. We therefore examined the influence of parental support on condom use trajectories and its correlates in a predominantly African-American sample (N similar to=similar to 627; 53% female participants; M similar to=similar to 14.86 similar to years [SD similar to=similar to 0.64]) from adolescence to young adulthood. We used hierarchical growth curve modeling to examine the relationship between condom use, substance use, psychological distress, and parental support prospectively. We found that consistent condom use decreased over time and was associated negatively with psychological distress and substance use. Furthermore, both maternal and paternal support were associated with more condom use over time. We discuss the implications of our findings for HIV prevention programs.

Adolescent Work and Alcohol Use Revisited: Variations by Family Structure	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Previous research finds adolescent work hours to be associated with increased alcohol use. Most studies, however, fail to account for possible selection effects that lead youth to both work and substance use. Using data from the first two waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 12,620), a fixed effects regression method is employed to control for stable between-person differences neglected by previous studies. Results show little relationship between work hours and alcohol use when controlling for individual heterogeneity. Results reveal variations, however, by family structure, with work hours being negatively associated with alcohol use among those from single-parent households. Although exhibiting significant main effects, family and peer processes fail to account for differences by family structure.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2012	22	4					694	703		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2012.00815.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2012.00815.x								23162371					WOS:000311107000009

The Trajectories of Adolescents' Perceptions of School Climate, Deviant Peer Affiliation, and Behavioral Problems During the Middle School Years	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This longitudinal study examined trajectories of change in adolescents perceptions of four dimensions of school climate (academic support, behavior management, teacher social support, and peer social support) and the effects of such trajectories on adolescent problem behaviors. We also tested whether school climate moderated the associations between deviant peer affiliation and adolescent problem behaviors. The 1,030 participating adolescents from eight schools were followed from sixth through eighth grades (54% female; 76% European American). Findings indicated that all the dimensions of school climate declined, and behavioral problems and deviant peer affiliation increased. Declines in each dimension were associated with increases in behavioral problems. The prediction of problem behavior from peer affiliation was moderated by adolescents perceptions of school climate.

Qualities of Peer Relations on Social Networking Websites: Predictions From Negative Mother-Teen Interactions	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined associations between characteristics of teenagers' relationships with their mothers and their later socializing behavior and peer relationship quality online. At age 13, teenagers and their mothers participated in an interaction in which mothers' and adolescents' behavior undermining autonomy and relatedness was observed and indicators of teens' depressive symptoms and social anxiety were assessed. At age 20, youth self-reported on their online behaviors, youths' social networking webpages were observationally coded to assess peer relationship quality online, and symptoms of depression and social anxiety were reassessed. Results suggested that problematic mother - teen relationships were predictive of youths' later preference for online communication and greater likelihood of forming a friendship with someone met online, yet poorer quality in online relationships. Findings are discussed within a developmental framework suggesting the importance of considering youths' family interactions during early adolescence as predictors of future online socializing behavior and online interactions with peers.

The Relations Between Parents' Smoking, General Parenting, Parental Smoking Communication, and Adolescents' Smoking	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The present study examined whether the associations between general parenting practices (i.e., support, behavioral control, and psychological control) and parental smoking on the one hand and older and younger siblings' smoking on the other were mediated by parental smoking communication (i.e., frequency and quality of parent-adolescent communication concerning smoking-related issues). The focus of this paper was on examining whether these associations of parental actions and adolescents' smoking were different in older and younger siblings within the family. Participants were 428 Dutch families (mother, father, and their 2 adolescent siblings aged 13-17). The results of parent and adolescent reports indicated that general parenting practices and parental smoking were associated with parental smoking communication, which, in turn, was related with adolescent smoking. The magnitude of the associations between parenting and adolescent smoking did not differ between older and younger siblings. Supportive parents were generally more likely to engage in a high quality communication about smoking with their adolescent children; this was related to a lower likelihood to smoke. Parents who exerted psychological control were more likely to talk more frequently with their adolescents on smoking matters, which in turn, relates to a higher likelihood to smoke. Also, smoking parents were less likely to have high-quality parent-adolescent communication that relates to higher likelihoods to smoke. In general, the findings were similar across reporters. Implications for prevention are addressed.

Multiple Social Identities and Adjustment in Young Adults From Ethnically Diverse Backgrounds	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												A person-centered approach was used to determine how identification across multiple social domains (ethnic, American, family, religious) was associated with distinct identity clusters. Utilizing data from 222 young adults from European, Filipino, Latin, and Asian American backgrounds, four clusters were found (Many Social Identities, Blended/Low Religious, Blended/Low Ethnic and American, Few Social Identities). Clusters were differentially associated with adjustment, both directly and via moderation of perceived ethnic discrimination. Those with low levels of identity across all four domains reported lower positive affect, higher negative affect, lower self-esteem, and perceived fewer American opportunities compared with individuals in other clusters. However, the Blended/Low Ethnic and American cluster exhibited more liabilities associated with discrimination. Discussion emphasizes the importance of multiple identities in development.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2008	18	4					643	670		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2008.00575.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2008.00575.x													WOS:000261116900003

Nine hundred and one middle school students named their friends. Independent data from these friends were used to construct friendship groups that were then characterized in terms of their mean level on measures of academic performance, social behavior, psychological closeness, and structure. Two novel conclusions emerge from the study. First, nearly all the friendship effects are domain-specific. That is, peer attributes in the school domain affect individual school performance outcomes, while peer attributes in the social behavior domain affect individual social behavior. Second, friends' grade point average (GPA) is the most powerful single friendship attribute. It has the largest total effect, the most consistent effects within its own school performance domain, and the sole reliable cross-domain impact-on an index of negative social behavior that taps into acting out and drug use. The within-domain peer effects mostly replicate past findings, though the methodological controls used here are more extensive than in past studies and so provide a stronger causal warrant.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2007	17	2					325	356		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2007.00525.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2007.00525.x													WOS:000246842900004

The analysis examined the pattern of arrests across five lifetime mental disorders (alcohol abuse, drug abuse, conduct disorder, major depressive episode, and posttraumatic stress disorder). The adolescents, ranging from 16 to 19 years old, were interviewed directly on the streets and in shelters in four Midwestern states using computer-assisted personal interviewing. Extensive self-reports of early life history, behaviors since running away from home, and diagnostic interviewing (UM-CIDI and DISC-R) were used to estimate possible disorders. There was a high level of postrunaway arrests reported by the youth; more than half were arrested at least once after the initial runaway, with the average of 4.4 times. Consistent with the hypotheses, there were differential associations between individual mental disorders and involvement with the criminal justice system. Only externalizing disorders such as substance abuse and conduct disorder were related to arrest. Street youth with multiple externalizing and internalizing disorders were more likely to be arrested than nondisordered youths.						/0000-0002-2091-2344													1050-8392	1532-7795					2006	16	3					379	402		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2006.00499.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2006.00499.x													WOS:000239334400002

It was predicted that attachment representations would moderate associations between negative mood regulation expectancies and conflict management tactics. Participants were 130 college students involved in a steady romantic relationship. They were administered the Adult Attachment Interview (George, Kaplan, & Main, 1996), questionnaires that assessed negative mood regulation expectancies, and were observed for 15 min resolving conflict with their romantic partner. The results confirmed the hypotheses. For example, secure youth with high negative mood regulation expectancies displayed good conflict management behavior, whereas dismissing youth who reported high confidence displayed more undesirable behavior. Implications for future research are discussed.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2004	14	2					235	255		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2004.01402005.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2004.01402005.x													WOS:000221766500005
J	Collins, WA				Collins, WA			More than myth: The developmental significance of romantic relationships during adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Adolescents' romantic relationships have attracted popular interest, but, until recently, little scientific curiosity Research has been impeded by erroneous assumptions that adolescent relationships are trivial and transitory, that they provide little information beyond measures of the influence of parent-child and peer relationships, and that their impact is primarily associated with problems of behavior and adjustment. This article proposes that distinguishing five features of romantic relationships (involvement, partner selection, relationship content, quality, and cognitive and emotional processes) is essential to describing adolescents' relationships and their developmental significance. These distinctions also help to clarify the role of context, age-related variations, and individual differences in the impact of romantic experiences. Research is needed to illuminate questions of how and under what conditions romantic relationships affect individual development and how romantic and other close relationships jointly influence developmental trajectories during adolescence.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2003	13	1					1	24		10.1111/1532-7795.1301001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1532-7795.1301001													WOS:000181454500001
J	Sim, TN; Koh, SF				Sim, TN; Koh, SF			A domain conceptualization of adolescent susceptibility to peer pressure	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study tested a domain conceptualization of adolescent susceptibility to peer pressure. Using the peer pressure domains identified by Clasen and Brown (1985), five susceptibility domains were proposed although only four (family involvement, school involvement, peer involvement, and misconduct) were tested. In terms of measurement, cross-validated results showed that the model with the four domains provided the best fit. In terms of age and sex patterns, the different susceptibilities were characterized by different patterns of age trends and sex differences. In terms of incremental validity, all four susceptibilities predicted behavior in their domains beyond other potential predictors. In terms of relations with a theoretical correlate, the four susceptibilities were differentially related to parental knowledge of adolescents' lives. This overall pattern of results provides converging support for the domain conceptualization.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2003	13	1					57	80																WOS:000181454500003

We asked 452 youths, ages 18-25, drawn from 4 ethnic groups (White, African American, Latino, and Asian American) about their own past sexual behavior (personal sexual timetables) and about acceptable ages for youths, in general, to engage in different sexual behaviors (normative sexual timetables). Students answered these questions twice: once when describing partners in a serious relationship and once when the partner was not well known. The results revealed that the interpersonal context had opposite effects on normative and personal timetables. Although sexual explorations were more acceptable with a serious partner, youth generally began sexual activities with a partner they did not know well. As predicted, the interpersonal context influenced the sexual timetables of White adolescents more than other groups, although only under certain conditions. Contrary to predictions, the effect on interpersonal context on sexual timetables was similar for both genders. Additionally, women had more restrictive timetables than men, and Asian American adolescents held more restricted timetables than other groups. African American adolescents had less restricted personal timetables than other ethnic groups, although this result was diminished when sociodemographic factors were controlled.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					1999	9	1					25	52		10.1207/s15327795jra0901_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0901_2													WOS:000078462000002

In this view, cognition and affect are seen as intertwined aspects of the process, which is inherently interpersonal as well as intrapersonal. Thus, a primary aspect of affect is a person's subjective understanding of interpersonal events. Subjective understanding of interpersonal events is multidimensional: It includes feeling states associated with the event, an appraisal of the purpose or intent of the event, and an appreciation of the significance of the event. In this article, we argue that this new definition of affect, with its focus on the subjective understanding of interpersonal events, can be used to expand our models of how observed family behaviors are related to adolescent psychosocial outcomes. We argue that an expanded model of the relations of family behaviors to adolescent outcomes should incorporate the following propositions: (a) adolescents' subjective understanding of family behaviors mediates the impact of those behaviors on adolescents' subsequent functioning and development, and (b) both ecological variables and individual differences influence adolescents' subjective understanding of family behaviors. We contend that this expanded model will increase our ability to find and understand associations between family behaviors and adolescent outcomes and will allow us to study more effectively the diversity of adolescent and family groups. A method for examining adolescents' subjective understanding of family behaviors, the video-recall method, is illustrated in a study of rural adolescents and their families.																			1050-8392						1994	4	4					585	600		10.1207/s15327795jra0404_9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0404_9													WOS:A1994QL36700009

Mark			Mother-adolescent communication and father-adolescent communication: Analyzing a 4-week family intervention using multi-informant data	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Families manage daily conflict through communication and healthy family communication is critical to promoting better family relationships and youth adjustment. Community families without high-risk factors, such as domestic dispute or clinical problems, are no less affected by the ramifications of poor communication and conflict management. However, there is limited translational research on community families analyzing the changes in parent-adolescent communication quality. This study aimed to test whether a brief 4-week family conflict intervention improved openness and problems in mother-adolescent (MA) and father-adolescent (DA) communication and whether mothers, fathers, and adolescents experienced the intervention effects differently. A total of 225 community families with adolescents were randomly assigned to either a parent-adolescent treatment condition (PA: n = 75), parent-only treatment condition (PO: n = 75), or control condition (n = 75). Mother, father, and adolescent reports on parent-adolescent communication were analyzed from pretest through a 3-year follow-up assessment, over five waves. ANCOVA results indicated significant intervention effects at posttest for mother-reported openness in MA communication, youth-reported openness in DA communication, and father-reported problems in DA communication, for PA condition. No significant intervention effects were found for PO condition. Exploratory trajectory analysis revealed the necessity of testing both linear and nonlinear models to be able to best illustrate the 3-year change trajectories of parent-adolescent communication quality. Resulting trajectories revealed interesting variations in longitudinal changes across three intervention conditions. The findings highlight the importance of involving fathers and adolescents in family intervention programs and the necessity of multi-informant assessment to better clarify the interplay among different family members behind the intervention effects.

The results showed that mother-adolescent closeness predicted a higher level and teacher-adolescent closeness predicted a smaller decrease in prosocial behavior. Teacher-adolescent conflict predicted a higher level, and mother-adolescent conflict predicted an increase in externalizing problems. Only temperament predicted internalizing problems. In addition, relationship quality both mediated and moderated some of the associations between temperament and socioemotional functioning.

The age-varying effects of adolescent stress on impulsivity and sensation seeking	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Adolescence is defined in part by heightened exposure and sensitivity to stressors. In a longitudinal cohort of youth at risk for substance use problems, we examined the age-varying relationship between stress exposure and traits that are central to the dual systems model. The positive associations between stress exposure, impulsivity, sensation seeking varied as function of age. Specifically, the influence of stress exposure on impulsivity strengthened during early adolescence and remained stable into early adulthood, while the influence of stress exposure on sensation seeking strengthened from early- to mid-adolescence and weakened thereafter. These findings suggest that the maturational imbalance between the capacity to regulate impulsive tendencies and sensation seeking may be exaggerated for youth who are exposed to a high number of stressors.

Innovative conceptual models and a variety of methodological techniques advance our understanding of the lived experiences of BIPOC youth who interact daily in contexts such as neighborhoods and educational settings in which racism and anti-immigrant sentiment pervades. Together, the papers in this issue examine the systemic forces at the root of experiences of oppression and advance the field toward improving short and long-term developmental outcomes for BIPOC adolescents.

Exposure to Online Racial Discrimination and Traumatic Events Online in Black Adolescents and Emerging Adults	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Online` racial discrimination and race-related traumatic events online have been linked to psychological distress in Black youth. The current study builds on extant literature by examining associations among online racial discrimination, traumatic events online, and trauma symptoms of discrimination, after controlling for gender identity and ethnic-racial setting of college in a sample of 245 Black youth. Additionally, this study examines the potential moderating effects of gender identity. This study is the first to examine the associations among online racial discrimination, traumatic events online, and trauma symptoms specific to racial discrimination. Path modeling revealed positive associations among online racial discrimination, traumatic events online, and trauma symptoms of discrimination. No significant differences in models were found by gender identity.

US Mexican-Origin Adolescents' Well-Being in the Context of Neighborhood White Concentration	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												To address injustices that privilege whiter neighborhoods, many advocate for residential integration. The developmental consequences of greater exposure to whiteness associated with integration, however, are unclear. Research examining BIPOC adolescent development within the context of intraindividual changes in neighborhood white concentration-the changes that take place if an adolescent moves to a whiter neighborhood or if their neighborhood becomes whiter-is needed. We examined trajectories of internalizing and externalizing symptoms in a longitudinal sample of U.S. Mexican adolescents (N = 749; 48.9% girls; 70.2% born in the United States). When adolescents experienced an uptick in neighborhood white concentration, they experienced a corresponding uptick in externalizing symptoms. We discuss the impacts of navigating whiter neighborhoods for U.S. Mexican adolescent well-being.

Data from 175 self-identified Asian American high school students were collected yearly for four consecutive years. Higher levels of ethnic identity centrality and regard and parent-adolescent closeness averaged across four years were associated with preferring a same-ethnic partner. Moreover, foreign-born adolescents were less likely to prefer a same-ethnic partner when they encountered a higher than average level of discrimination on any given year. Results highlight variability in the developmental and individual-level factors that shape how adolescents navigate their dating relationships.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				SEP	2020	30	3					669	686		10.1111/jora.12551	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12551								32077538					WOS:000562921000007

A SNP, Gene, and Polygenic Risk Score Approach of Oxytocin-Vasopressin Genes in Adolescents' Loneliness	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Not much is known regarding underlying biological pathways to adolescents' loneliness. Insight in underlying molecular mechanisms could inform intervention efforts aimed at reducing loneliness. Using latent growth curve modeling, baseline levels and development of loneliness were studied in two longitudinal adolescent samples. Genes (OXTR, OXT, AVPR1A, AVPR1B) were examined using SNP-based, gene-based, and polygenic risk score (PRS) approaches. In both samples, SNP- and gene-based tests showed involvement of the OXTR gene in development of loneliness, though, significance levels did not survive correction for multiple testing. The PRS approach provided no evidence for relations with loneliness. We recommend alternative phenotyping methods, including environmental factors, to consider epigenetic studies, and to examine possible endophenotypes in relation to adolescents' loneliness.

Dating Relationship Dynamics, Mental Health, and Dating Victimization: A Longitudinal Path Analysis	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The purpose of this study was to assess the longitudinal association between adolescent dating relationship dynamics (measures of intimacy and problem dynamics), mental health, and physical and/or sexual victimization by a dating partner. Gender-stratified analyses were conducted in a sample of 261 adolescents, ages 10-18 at baseline, interviewed in three annual waves (2013-2015) of the nationally representative Survey on Teen Relationships and Intimate Violence (STRiV). Among male daters, better mental health at baseline was negatively associated with problem dynamics at follow-up, and aspects of problem dynamics at baseline predicted worse mental health at follow-up. However, unexpectedly, aspects of relationship intimacy at baseline were also negatively associated with mental health at follow-up. Male daters' victimization did not mediate longitudinal measures of mental health or of relationship dynamics, but did predict worse mental health at follow-up. Among female daters, we found no longitudinal associations between mental health and intimacy or problem relationship dynamics, in either direction. However, victimization mediated aspects of female daters' reported relationship dynamics. Dating violence prevention efforts should reflect that adolescent females reporting controlling behaviors and feelings of passionate love may be at increased risk for victimization. Positive youth development efforts should attend to the bidirectional associations of mental health and dating relationship dynamics over time, particularly for male adolescents.

Depression and Anxiety Symptoms in Female Adolescents: Relations with Parental Psychopathology and Parenting Behavior	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Parental psychopathology and parenting behavior are known to be related to adolescents depression and anxiety, but unique roles of mothers and fathers are not clear. Our aim was to examine the relation of maternal and paternal psychopathology, emotional support, and respect for autonomy, and their interaction to depression and anxiety symptoms in adolescents. In total, 142 female adolescents participated, together with 138 mothers and 113 fathers. Data were analyzed using latent growth curve modeling. Paternal emotional support was negatively related to adolescent baseline level of depression and anxiety symptoms. Further, we found that there was a positive association between respect for autonomy and depression symptoms in adolescents for higher levels of paternal symptoms of psychological problems.					scholte, ron/G-2030-2012	Rasing, Sanne/0000-0002-6949-7022; Brunwasser, Steven/0000-0002-3476-5437													1050-8392	1532-7795				MAR	2020	30	1					298	313		10.1111/jora.12525	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12525		JUL 2019						31355507					WOS:000481262300001

First, we include a brief overview of pubertal change. Second, we propose a critical role for puberty in shaping life span health due to its connections with early life precursors, health issues and risks emerging during puberty, and health in young adulthood and beyond. Next, we discuss the importance of puberty measures in developmental research and suggest ways to make the science of puberty an important standalone research entity, as well as an essential component of studies conducted during adolescence. Finally, we discuss measurement issues, novel theoretical models of puberty, and the necessity of adopting an interdisciplinary perspective in research on puberty and in adolescence more broadly.

Adolescent Responses to Completing Health Surveys	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The aim of this study is to describe the self-reported experiences of adolescents in population-based samples when completing health-related surveys on topics with varying potential for evoking distress. Survey data were collected in three school-based studies of bullying behaviors (N = 1,771, 12-14 years), alcohol use (N = 823, 12, 15, and 17 years), and electronic image sharing (N = 274, 13 years). Between 5% and 15% of respondents reported being upset at survey completion, but at most 1.4% were entirely negative in their evaluation. Age was not associated with being upset, but younger adolescents were more likely to see benefit in participation. Although concurrent mental health symptoms increased the risk of being upset, this was mostly mitigated by perceived benefits from participation.

We estimated growth curve models to compare how components of parental monitoringadolescent disclosure, parental solicitation, and parental knowledgechanged over 2years for SMGs and heterosexual girls. SMGs and heterosexual girls had similar trajectory slopes and quadratic forms of adolescent disclosure, but SMGs had consistently lower adolescent disclosure scores. Parental knowledge trajectories indicated differential intercepts and slopes for SMGs compared to heterosexual girls, suggesting potential higher risk for maladaptive behaviors.

Self-Efficacy About Sexual Risk/Protective Behaviors: Intervention Impact Trajectories Among American Indian Youth	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												For adolescents, normative development encompasses learning to negotiate challenges of sexual situations; of special importance are skills to prevent early pregnancy, HIV, and other sexually transmitted diseases. Disparities in sexual risk among American Indian youth point to the importance of intervening to attenuate this risk. This study explored the impact of Circle of Life (COL), an HIV prevention intervention based on social cognitive theory, on trajectories of self-efficacy (refusing sex, avoiding sexual situations) among 635 students from 13 middle schools on one American Indian reservation. COL countered a normative decline of refusal self-efficacy among girls receiving the intervention by age 13, while girls participating at age 14 or older, girls in the comparison group, and all boys showed continuing declines.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				SEP	2017	27	3					697	704		10.1111/jora.12308	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12308								28776843					WOS:000407225100016

Less is known about whether moving during adolescence, childhood, or both periods explains this connection and whether the extent of mobility matters. Analytic shortcomings with much of the research call into question extant findings. We examined associations between childhood, adolescent, and child-adolescent mobility and adolescents' achievement (math and reading) and behavior problems (internalizing and externalizing). With a multisite, longitudinal sample (N=1,056), we employed propensity score methods, which mitigate concerns about selection bias on observed variables, to investigate relationships. Results suggest that multiple, child-adolescent movers had more internalizing problems in adolescence than their stable peers, but did not differ on externalizing problems or achievement.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2017	27	2					328	343		10.1111/jora.12288	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12288								28876529					WOS:000401163500005

Predictions From Early Adolescent Emotional Repair Abilities to Functioning in Future Relationships	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined adolescents' ability to utilize emotional repair-to actively change negative moods to more positive moods-as a predictor of the quality of their developing peer and romantic relationships over time. Utilizing observational data and partners' reports, adolescents (N = 184), their close peers, and their romantic partners were followed from ages 15-19. Adolescents with initially stronger emotional repair abilities were rated as increasingly socially competent over time, and both displayed and experienced increasingly positive interactive behaviors with close peers over time. These adolescents' romantic partners also reported more positive relationships, with enhanced communication, and fewer critical, blaming, or hostile interactions.

Mexican American Adolescents' Emotional Support to the Family in Response to Parental Stress	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												In this two-wave longitudinal, daily diary study that followed up with 421 Mexican American parent-adolescent dyads (adolescents: M-age = 15 years, 50% males) after 1 year, we investigated the contingency between parental stressors and adolescents' emotional support to family members. Adolescents provided support to their parents and other family members at similar rates, but adolescents were more likely to provide support to other family members than to their parents on days when parents experienced a family stressor. This pattern was especially pronounced in families with parents who reported physical symptoms and adolescents with a strong sense of family obligation. Adolescents' provision of emotional support was associated with same-day feelings of role fulfillment, but not to their concurrent or long-term psychological distress.

The Socioeconomic Pathways Leading to Romantic Relationship Outcomes: A Genetically Informed Early Life Course Investigation	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The present study tests a multilevel comprehensive model incorporating both life course processes and genetic influences leading to young adults' romantic relationship quality using data from 1,560 adolescents over 13 years in the nationally representative Add Health sample. Results provided evidence of a socioeconomic mediating pathway linking early family and community contexts to young adults' romantic relationship quality, and novel evidence for both direct and interactive genetic associations that relate to these mediating pathways. A cumulative genetic index showed (a) direct associations with young adults' socioeconomic attainment and (b) interactions with community adversity and mothers' marital stability on young adults' achieved socioeconomic context and relationship quality.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				SEP	2016	26	3					492	508		10.1111/jora.12207	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12207								28581647					WOS:000381895900010

This study investigates how mother-child and best friend relationship quality predict the deflection of youth from adaptive to maladaptive behavior with peers or the reverse. Using data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 1,055), high-quality friendships were associated with changes in peer social competence from 3rd to 6th grade. More positive and fewer negative interactions with a friend were linked with becoming more prosocial with peers, whereas less positive interactions with a friend were linked to becoming aggressive or withdrawn.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2016	26	2					270	285		10.1111/jora.12190	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12190								27231420					WOS:000374772800004
J	Russell, ST				Russell, Stephen T.			Social Justice, Research, and Adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												In what ways might research on adolescence contribute to social justice? My 2014 Presidential Address identified strategies for social justice in our field. First, we need research that is conscious of biases, power, and privilege in science, as well as in our roles as scholars. Second, we need research that attends to inequities in lives of adolescents, and as scholars we need to question the ways that our research may unwittingly reinforce those inequalities. Third, we need research that attends to urgencies, that is, issues or conditions that influence adolescents' well-being which demand attention and action. I draw from a range of concepts and theoretical perspectives to make the case for a framework of social justice in research on adolescence.

Presently, we are in a time of rapid change in multiple areas of roles and systems that influence the development of adolescents. This article identifies some examples of these important shifts, and suggests that a positive development emphasis can provide important advances in useful research and action related to helping prepare youth for the coming world. In introducing this special issue, the intent is to highlight the many areas of needed research, provide some promising and innovative approaches to such research, and note how these are examples of positive development approaches that have much to offer adolescent research.

Network-Behavior Dynamics Introduction	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Researchers have become increasingly interested in disentangling selection and influence processes. This literature review provides context for the special issue on network-behavior dynamics. It brings together important conceptual, methodological, and empirical contributions focusing on longitudinal social network modeling. First, an overview of mechanisms underlying selection and influence is given. After a description of the shortcomings of previous studies in this area, the stochastic actor-based model is sketched; this is used in this special issue to examine network-behavior dynamics. The preconditions for such analyses are discussed, as are common model specification issues. Next, recent empirical advances in research on adolescence are discussed, focusing on new insights into moderating effects, initiation of behaviors, time heterogeneity, mediation effects, and negative ties.

The Developmental Assets Profile (DAP) measured the project's impact on ecological and individual assets. Analysis of two cohorts involving more than 600 intervention and 400 control adolescents (Mage=13.5) showed a significant increase in project girls' developmental assets, with an average effect size, net of contamination and control group scores, of .80. The results suggest the Project's effectiveness in improving human and social capital for vulnerable adolescent girls living in rural Bangladesh villages, and the utility of the DAP as a cross-culturally relevant measurement tool.

An Initial Investigation of Sexual Minority Youth Involvement in School-Based Extracurricular Activities	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Sexual minority youth are at risk for negative school-based experiences and poor academic outcomes. Yet, little is known about their experiences in positive school-based contexts. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (1,214 sexual minority and 11,427 heterosexual participants), this study compared participation rates in, predictors of, and outcomes associated with three types of school-based extracurricular activitiessports, arts, and school clubsby sexual orientation and gender. Findings revealed several significant sexual orientation and gender differences in participation rates in school-based sports, clubs, and arts activities. Furthermore, findings suggested that the outcomes associated with extracurricular activity involvement do not differ by sexual orientation and gender; however, predictors of participation in these domains varied across groups.

Social competence showed strong continuity, with the most socially competent children remaining so in adolescence. Early pubertal maturation and school transitions accentuate individual differences, increasing social competence among more competent youth, but further diminishing social competence among less competent individuals. In essence, facing challenges that require social competence may further separate competent individuals from less competent peers. Thus, the psychosocially rich become richer, while the psychosocially poor become poorer.

Empathy and Self-Regulation as Mediators Between Parenting and Adolescents' Prosocial Behavior Toward Strangers, Friends, and Family	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The current study examined the role of empathy and self-regulation as mediators between positive parenting (mothering and fathering) and early adolescents' prosocial behavior toward 3 targets (strangers, friends, and family). Data were taken from Time 1 and Time 2 of the Flourishing Families Project, and included reports from 500 families with an early adolescent child (mean age of child at Time 1 = 11.29). Analyses suggested that predictors of prosocial behavior toward the 3 targets differed, with empathy (as reported by mothers only) and self-regulation mediating the relation between positive parenting and prosocial behavior toward strangers and friends, but not toward family. Positive mothering was the only variable that was significantly related to prosocial behavior toward family. The discussion focuses on the need for continued research examining a relational approach to prosocial development.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2011	21	3					545	551		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00695.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00695.x													WOS:000293790200002

Adolescents' Triangulation in Marital Conflict and Peer Relations	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined the association between youths' triangulation in marital conflict and three aspects of their peer relations in 416 families during early adolescence. A 4-wave, longitudinal research design was used. As hypothesized, triangulation was associated negatively with perceived support from friends and positively with perceived peer rejection. Triangulation was a risk factor for both sons and daughters. Adolescent problem behavior did not mediate the significant association between triangulation and perceived friendship support. Adolescent problem behavior, particularly internalizing problems, completely me diated the association between triangulation and adolescents' perceptions of peer rejection, suggesting the important developmental role of adolescents' anxiety, depressive affect, and withdrawal. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of Bowen's multigenerational family systems theory and social learning principles.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2009	19	4					669	689		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00616.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00616.x													WOS:000271974500005

Data were collected in a 3-year longitudinal study that covered the premigration through postmigration periods. Immigrant adolescents were compared with nonemigrating adolescents in Russia and Ukraine. Psychological well-being of immigrants was highest in the premigration period. During the process of immigration, general self-esteem, body image, social competence, school competence, and loneliness followed a U-curve: they declined in the 1st year after immigration and improved in the 3rd year after immigration. Emotional and behavioral problems of immigrants increased in the 1st year after immigration and did not change in subsequent years. At the end of the 3-year period, self-esteem exceeded the premigration level, emotional and behavioral problems and loneliness remained below the premigration level, while body image, social competence, and school competence returned to the premigration level. Throughout the entire immigration period, the psychological well-being of immigrants was higher than that of nonemigrating adolescents. Premigration psychological well-being as well as perceived social conditions in the host country (discrimination and social support) predicted postmigration psychological well-being. The results obtained are discussed in light of the stress-coping model of immigration and ecological systems theory.

The respondents were followed over 3 time points from ages 13/14 to 20/21. Latent growth curve analyses were conducted showing that girls' dieting scores increased while boys' scores remained constant. Gender differences in the development of dieting could be explained neither by differences in the development of appearance dissatisfaction nor by changes in relation to parents. In contrast, the dieting differences between boys and girls could be partially explained by a greater increase in emotional problems among girls compared with boys. Further research is needed, targeting in particular younger age groups, in order to acquire knowledge on whether appearance dissatisfaction serves as mediator of gender differences in dieting at other ages.					von Soest, Tilmann/P-4350-2014	von Soest, Tilmann/0000-0002-5576-2059													1050-8392	1532-7795					2009	19	3					509	529		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00605.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00605.x													WOS:000269058100008

Adolescents' peer crowd identification in the Netherlands: Structure and associations with problem behaviors	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The present paper examined the underlying structure of Dutch adolescents' peer crowd identification and its relations with delinquency, aggression, depression, and anxiety Questionnaire data were gathered from 2,334 adolescents between ages 12 and 19. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed four clearly interpretable crowd-identification dimensions: Alternative, Urban, Conventional, and Achievement Oriented. Identification with the Alternative and Urban dimensions was found to be positively related to depression, delinquency, and aggression. With regard to the Urban dimension, also a positive association was found with anxiety. Identification with the Conventional- and Achievement Oriented dimensions was found to be negatively related to delinquency. A negative associations was also found between the Achievement Oriented dimension and aggression. Roughly the same pattern of associations was found for boys and girls, and younger and older adolescents.

This paper integrates research on social and psychological consequences of victimization with theory and research on socioeconomic attainment to propose a theoretical model that situates adolescent victimization in the socioeconomic life course. Examination of data from a national sample of American adolescents (ages 11-17 in 1976) indicates a chain-like sequence in which victimization diminishes educational self-efficacy, which subsequently undermines educational performance and attainment. Through diminished educational attainment, adolescent victimization has substantial and wide-ranging effects on socioeconomic attainment in early adulthood. Theoretical and policy implications of these findings are discussed.

Evidence suggests that the beginnings of wisdom are observed in adolescence. But are the correlates of wisdom-related performance in adolescence different from those in adulthood because of differences in developmental status? To answer this question, heterogeneous samples of German adolescents (N = 148, 14-20 years) and adults (N = 143, 35-75 years) responded verbally to 2 wisdom-related tasks and completed a psychometric battery involving measures of intelligence, personality, and the personality-intelligence interface. As predicted, in the adolescent sample intelligence and personality emerged as the strongest unique predictors of wisdom-related performance. In contrast, in the adult sample the interface measures were the strongest unique predictors. Implications for the facilitation of positive development in adolescence are discussed.

Consistent with hypotheses, greater adolescent-rated parental behavioral control and better observer-rated mother-adolescent communication were associated with lower levels of adolescent problem behavior, as examined using structural equation modeling. Furthermore, interrelationships between age and adolescent problem behavior were partially mediated by adolescents' reports of parental behavioral control and observers' ratings of positive mother-adolescent communication, which both decreased with adolescents' age. Although the sample was primarily middle class, higher socioeconomic status was associated with more positive mother-adolescent communication, as rated by observers. Problem behavior was greater among boys than girls, but the hypothesized indirect effect of gender on problem behavior through associations with parenting was not observed. The findings demonstrate the utility of conceptually distinguishing between parenting and parent-adolescent relationships, and suggest that both have unique influences on middle-class African American adolescents' problem behavior.

The adolescents' subjective views of their relationships with their mothers and fathers were assessed with respect to seven relationship qualities (general warmth, displays of warmth, intimate self-disclosure, parental monitoring, conflict, instrumental aid, and provisions of autonomy) across two cognition types: perceptions (beliefs about "how things are") and standards (beliefs about "how things should be"). The participants were sixth-, eighth-, tenth-, and twelfth-grade students. Peer sociometric status was determined based on unlimited peer nominations completed by 462 participants. The 190 adolescents classified as average, popular, or rejected were included in the analyses. Perceptions and standards were shown to be distinct but related cognitions. Rejected adolescents differed from their more accepted peers in their perceptions of relationships with both mothers and fathers, specifically with regard to warmth from both parents and autonomy from mothers. Rejected adolescents also reported lower standards for parental monitoring and a range of support qualities from both parents. In addition, rejected adolescents' reports demonstrated greater perception-standard discrepancies, indicating unmet standards. Overall, sociometric status group differences were more pronounced and consistent for standards than for perceptions, and most status group differences occurred primarily among older adolescents. Findings are discussed in terms of social cognitive patterns associated with peer rejection and developmental changes in family-peer linkages across adolescence.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2001	11	3					245	272		10.1111/1532-7795.00012	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1532-7795.00012													WOS:000171002000002

Two distinct behavioral profiles were examined: aggressive behavior and socially withdrawn behavior. It was hypothesized that these 2 behavioral profiles (in conjunction with overall popularity within the peer group) would predict differential coping strategy use in the peer domain. It was also expected that perceived control would mediate the association between peer experience and coping. Grade 7 students from a regional high school (N = 249) participated in 2 group testing sessions. During the Ist session, students completed peer ratings of likability and social behavior; during the 2nd session, students provided written accounts of 3 recent daily hassles experienced within the peer group, indicating how they appraised each hassle and how they coped. As expected, more aggressive adolescents perceived more control over their peer hassles. More aggressive, unpopular adolescents used more negative strategies, whereas more popular, aggressive female adolescents used more problem-focused strategies. In contrast, more withdrawn adolescents perceived more limited control over their peer hassles, and they used fewer negative strategies and fewer problem-focused strategies, but employed more emotion-focused strategies. Popularity did not interact with peer perceived withdrawal, nor did any main effects of popularity emerge. The proposed mediational role of control was generally not supported, although perceived control did vary as a function of peer experience and sex. Results of this study reinforce the utility of combining elements of the social problem-solving literature (e.g., individual interactional style, impact of behavior on others) and the stress and coping literature (e.g., situational variability, predicting adjustment from coping strategy use) to derive a better understanding of peer group processes during early adolescence.																			1050-8392						2000	10	2					211	243		10.1207/SJRA1002_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/SJRA1002_5													WOS:000086241200005

However, the definition of youth development programs is elusive. Most simply, youth development programs are programs that provide opportunities and support to help youth gain the competencies and knowledge they need to meet the increasing challenges they will face as they mature. Typically, they are community based,rather than school based. In this article, we evaluate the usefulness of the youth development framework based on 15 program evaluations. The results of the evaluations are discussed and 3 general themes emerge. First, programs incorporating more elements of the youth development framework seem to show more positive outcomes. Second, the evaluations support the importance of a caring adult-adolescent relationship, although these relationships need not be limited to 1-on-1 mentoring. And 3rd, longer-term programs that engage youth throughout adolescence appear to be the most effective. The policy and programmatic implications of these findings are discussed.																			1050-8392						1998	8	4					423	459		10.1207/s15327795jra0804_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0804_2													WOS:000077473100002

Consistent with accelerating interest in the understanding of affective processes during the adolescent period, the Behavioral, Cognitive, and Social Processes Research Branch of NIMH generously supported several meetings to plan the workshop, the workshop itself, and the sustained subsequent efforts to transform the 2 days of talks and discussions into a coherent volume that could be distributed to our scientific colleagues. The major goal of the workshop, organized by Stuart Hauser and Lynne Huffman, was to explore multilevel approaches to research on affective processes during the adolescent period, including psychophysiological, behavioral, intrapsychic, interactional, and sociocultural perspectives. Experts and discussants were invited to discuss conceptual advances that might be facilitated by an integration and cross-fertilization of basic and clinical viewpoints. Workshop participants and observes were also encouraged of offer suggestions regarding critical future research questions.																			1050-8392						1994	4	4					465	467		10.1207/s15327795jra0404_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0404_1													WOS:A1994QL36700001

This study aimed to identify PIU profiles using Latent Profile Analysis, and to analyze the differences in them attending to some of the principal PIU risk and protective factors. A total of 675 Spanish adolescents completed questionnaires assessing PIU, Internet usage, mental health problems, personality, psychological strengths, and family relationships. Four profiles were obtained: Nonproblematic use (68.30% of the sample), Slightly problematic use (17.90% of the sample), Problematic use (8.50% of the sample), and Severe problematic use (5.40% of the sample). Results showed differences between them, with the profile with more PIU having more risk factors and less protective factors. Results showed that many different personal and social variables included in the study play a role in PIU. Knowing the different PIU profiles can help in the design of more specific and precise procedures and instruments for risk assessment, as well as aiding in prevention and in the design of more individualized treatments.

Youth' coping can minimize the adverse impact of this stress. Less is known about the intermediary processes related to youths' cultural stressor experiences and coping responses. We analyzed focus group data from H/L youth (N = 45; 50% girls; 0% nonbinary; Mage = 15.3) to hear their voices on how they interpret, react to, are impacted by and cope with cultural stressors. Using a Grounded Theory approach, we constructed four themes of intermediary processes (e.g., meaning making) and four themes of coping (e.g., distancing oneself). Youth actively processed their experiences, which informed their coping choices, pointing to youths' agency and resilience.

On the within-person level, which is the level on which the processes theoretically should play out, we found no support for the proposed mediation model for boys or for girls. Unexpectedly, we found that following times of more exposure to peer sexual harassment than usual, early adolescents instead experienced higher appearance esteem and fewer emotional problems than usual. More research is needed to replicate and understand these unexpected findings.

A RCT in three Arizona cities, with 585 parents of urban AI adolescents, tested whether a culturally tailored parenting intervention for urban AI families, Parenting in 2 Worlds (P2W), increased parent-adolescent communication about sexuality, compared to an informational family health intervention that was not culturally tailored. P2W produced significantly larger increases on two measures: communication about general sexual health and about sexual decision-making.

We investigated whether adolescents' antisocial behavior was associated with conflict management styles, and whether it predicted breakup 3 months later. In total, 91 adolescent couples (M-age = 16.43, SD = 0.99; 41.2% Hispanic/Latinx) participated in videotaped conflict discussions coded for negotiation, coercion, and avoidance. Actor-partner interdependence models suggest adolescents' antisocial behavior is associated with decreased use of negotiation (couple pattern) and increased use of coercion (actor pattern). No significant associations were found for avoidance. Neither antisocial behavior nor conflict management styles predicted breakup.

Using data from 444 Chinese American adolescents (M-age = 13.04, 54% female), this study examined the independent and joint influence of individual cultural characteristics (adolescents' acculturation and enculturation) and contextual factors (parental discrimination experiences, neighborhood disadvantage, and ethnic concentration) on Chinese American adolescents' perception of discrimination experiences. Results showed that acculturation was associated with fewer discrimination experiences; yet, higher levels of neighborhood disadvantage were related to more youth discrimination. Mothers' discrimination experiences were associated with adolescents' discrimination experiences when adolescents retained more of their Chinese culture. The findings of the study highlight the importance of considering the interplay between contextual and individual factors in influencing adolescents' development.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2022	32	2			SI		518	532		10.1111/jora.12759	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12759		APR 2022						35443094					WOS:000789569700001

Twenty-nine in-depth interviews were conducted with adolescents and adults about adolescence. We analyzed the cultural models the public use to make meaning about what adolescence is, what development involves, what adolescents need, and how adolescents can be supported. The analysis revealed several cultural models that may impede public engagement around youth issues.

We build on past research by addressing multiple mechanisms of social influence-peers' frequency of drunkenness, alcohol-related attitudes, and unstructured socializing-across relationship types. Adolescents' drunkenness frequency increased when their friends' and partners' friends' drunkenness frequency increased and when their romantic partners' positive alcohol-related attitudes increased. Furthermore, the association between unstructured socializing and frequency of drunkenness was stronger for older than younger adolescents.

With an ethnically and sexually diverse sample, this study compared adolescents' self-reported peer victimization in 6th grade to their own retrospective reports of 6th-grade victimization when they were in the 12th grade, controlling for past and current adjustment. Overall, 12th graders' retrospective victimization reports correlated with their own earlier 6th-grade self-reports and there was a general tendency to underreport retrospectively. Underreporters were distinguished by worse past 6th-grade adjustment, whereas overreporters were distinguished by worse current (12th-grade) adjustment. Higher current depressive symptoms and social anxiety, and lower current self-worth may be important control variables when collecting retrospective reports of victimization because current adjustment may augment participants' recollection of past experiences.

Weight climate, characterized by weight-policing, was assessed indirectly by examining how strongly self-reported weight predicts victim reputation within 26 ethnically diverse middle schools. Social-emotional indicators included self-reported loneliness, school belonging, and self-esteem. In schools with stronger weight-policing at seventh grade, loneliness was intensified by eighth grade among both girls (n = 2,101) and boys (n = 1,985) with higher weight. Similar effects were found for low self-esteem among girls. Additionally, boys-regardless of their weight-reported lower sense of belonging in schools with stronger weight-policing. The study offers a new method to estimate school weight climate, and the findings provide insights for interventions.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2019	29	2					466	479		10.1111/jora.12386	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12386								29532971					WOS:000471828900017

"It's Just a Lot of Work": Adolescents' Self-Presentation Norms and Practices on Facebook and Instagram	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												We explored adolescents' (12- to 18-year-olds; n = 51) awareness of their audience and subsequent self-presentation practices on Facebook and Instagram through focus group discussions. Findings suggest that teens, who are developmentally able to perceive a situation from the third-person perspective and who value peer approval, purposefully share content to appear interesting, well liked, and attractive. Some teens invested great effort into posting by these norms, even asking their friends to help; however, this was more common among girls. Older teens especially discussed taking the perspective of their audience when deciding what to post, which is consistent with the finding that perspective taking continues to develop throughout adolescence. These findings suggest that perspective taking skills and need for peer approval influence self-presentation online.

In a sample of 984 adolescents and their parents, we examined whether effects of parental support, proactive, punitive, harsh punitive, and psychological control on externalizing problem behavior are moderated by adolescents' genotype for the dopamine transporter (DAT1) or receptor D4 (DRD4) gene. Results provided evidence for main effects of parenting behavior and DRD4, and multiple interaction effects of which one survived Bonferroni correction. Adolescents carrying a long DRD4 variant were more susceptible to the effects of parental proactive control on aggression, for better and for worse. Critical considerations were made regarding the complexity of GxE research.

The aim of this multi-methodological study was to relate the amygdala reactivity of students (N = 88) toward teachers' fearful and angry faces, to students' relationship with their teachers. Furthermore, students' neural responses during the perception of teachers' faces were tested as predictors of test anxiety (controlling for neuroticism as a potential trait anxiety effect). Multiple regression analysis revealed that students reporting high-quality teacher-student relationships showed stronger amygdala activity toward fearful faces, which was related to worry. Furthermore, students with high levels of neuroticism tended to perceive their teachers as motivators and showed higher amygdala activity toward angry faces, which was related to the measures of emotionality.

Daily Dynamics of Adolescent Mood and Identity	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Important linkages between daily mood and identity formation have been theorized, but have not been empirically tested as of yet. This study provided a first examination of these linkages within individuals (N = 392; 55.1% boys; M-age at T1 = 13.24, SD = 0.44) across 15 series of 5 days distributed over 5 years. Results revealed negative within-time associations of educational and relational commitment with negative mood. Negative mood was positively associated with educational in-depth exploration and educational and interpersonal reconsideration. Additionally, there were some cross-lagged effects suggesting that identity and mood mutually affect one another across days. These results contribute to the growing knowledge on how identity unfolds in everyday life by revealing important associations with daily mood.					kuppens, peter/DHG-5268-2022; Klimstra, Theo/H-2503-2013; Meeus, Wim/H-8099-2013; Koot, Hans/D-9466-2012; Branje, Susan/A-7813-2010	Branje, Susan/0000-0002-9999-5313; kuppens, peter/0000-0002-2363-2356; Koot, Hans/0000-0002-9643-2363													1050-8392	1532-7795				SEP	2016	26	3					459	473		10.1111/jora.12205	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12205								28581654					WOS:000381895900008

The Development of Math-Race Stereotypes: "They Say Chinese People Are the Best at Math"	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Sixty elementary-school children (9-10years old) and 82 adolescents (12-13years old) completed explicit and implicit measures of racial stereotypes about math. 60 Asian, 42 Latino, 21 White, 15 Black, and four multiracial students participated (42% boys). On the explicit measure, children as early as fifth grade reported being aware of the stereotype that Asians=math, but only adolescents personally endorsed this stereotype. On the implicit measure, there was significant evidence for racial stereotypes about math among adolescents. Across both ages, individual students' explicit awareness of the stereotype was significantly correlated with their implicit stereotypes. Early adolescence is a key developmental window for discussing stereotypes before they become endorsed as personal beliefs.

We conducted thematic analyses of interviews, comparing narratives of families of sexually risky (n=9) versus nonsexually risky (n=11) youth. Family functioning differed by youth sexual risk behavior around quality of relationships, communication, and limit setting and monitoring. The involvement of families of sexually risky youth in probation positively influenced family functioning.

Late adolescents who filled out questionnaires at two annual measurements were used in a longitudinal social network approach (N=1006; Mage=16.62). Results showed that peers' involvement in illegal political behavior predicted adolescents' increases in illegal political behavior.

Multisite Violence Prevention	Moderating Effects of School Climate on Outcomes for the Multisite Violence Prevention Project Universal Program	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examines to what extent baseline school climate moderates the effects of a randomized controlled trial of a universal violence prevention intervention. School climate was assessed by teacher ratings of the quality of relationships among school members and the seriousness of school problems. Cluster analysis revealed three climate types: distressed, average, and conducive. Mixed-effects regression models of data from 5,256 students suggested limited overall positive program outcomes for students in schools assigned to the universal intervention versus students in schools assigned to control conditions. There was, however, evidence of differential effects of the universal intervention by climate type.

In this study, trajectories of antisocial behavior were estimated for early adolescent boys and girls. Data were obtained from a 3-year longitudinal study of 11 middle schools in the western United States (n=5,742), with assessments completed four times per academic year. Antisocial behavior increased steadily throughout 6th grade, but beginning in 7th grade for boys and 8th grade for girls it declined during the school year. Significant increases between Grades 6-7 and 7-8 were found for both genders. Trajectories varied by contextual and individual-level social victimization and gender.

We examined associations between partner deviance and offending for women who were sentenced to confinement within a juvenile correctional facility in adolescence. Most (73.6%) women dated deviant partners in adulthood. Women with deviant partners experienced significant continuity in violent crime between adolescence and adulthood, whereas those with nondeviant partners did not. Results held after controlling for age, relationship length, and peer deviance. Partner deviance was associated with increased nonviolent crime within adulthood, but did not moderate the continuity of nonviolent crime. Interventions targeting the development of prosocial relationships might help reduce violence among high-risk girls.

These theories have the autonomous-related self at their point of intersection. Autonomy and relatedness dynamics is the key to understanding the self, and family is the main developmental niche for the self. Adolescence is an important phase of development where environmental demands and social-cultural norms impinge on the conceptions of what is valued and what is not. Both a contextual and a universalistic perspective are used here, the former in order to understand why certain patterns of self emerge in certain contexts, and the latter to develop insights into what might be optimal in adolescent development.																			1050-8392						2013	23	2			SI		223	235		10.1111/jora.12041	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12041													WOS:000319332400004

Identity Formation of American Indian Adolescents: Local, National, and Global Considerations	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												A conceptual model is presented that approaches identity formation of American Indian adolescents according to 3 levels of social contextual influence-local, national, and global-relative to types of identity, dynamics of identity, and sources of influence. Ethnic identity of American Indians is embedded within the local cultural milieu and encompasses an array of dimensions organized around identification, connection, and culture/spirituality. The national or societal level brings additional complexities according to bicultural, multicultural, and hybrid types of identity. There is little known about the global implications of identity formation for American Indian adolescents, but a review of the construct of indigenous identity provides some guidance along with examination of identity formation of indigenous youth in other parts of the world.

Development of Mathematics Interest in Adolescence: Influences of Gender, Family, and School Context	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study investigated adolescents' developmental trajectories of mathematics interest and explored related effects of gender, family, and school context. Latent growth curve modeling was used to analyze longitudinal data of N=3,193 students (51% female) from grades 5 to 9 from all 3 ability tracks of the German state school system. Annual assessments involved student questionnaires on interest in mathematics, perceptions of classroom characteristics (classroom values for mathematics, mathematics teacher enthusiasm), as well as parent questionnaires regarding family values for mathematics. Results indicated a downward trend of students' mathematics interest that plateaued in later years, with high variability in mean levels, but little variability in the shape of the growth trajectories. Boys reported higher mathematics interest than girls, but similar downward growth trajectories. Students from the lowest ability track showed more favorable interest trajectories than students from the middle and highest tracks.

In-School Versus Out-of-School Friendships and Academic Achievement Among an Ethnically Diverse Sample of Adolescents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Much of the research on adolescent friendships and school achievement has focused on in-school friends, ignoring the potential effects of having out-of-school friendships. The goal of this study was to examine the relation between having relatively more in-school friends and school achievement among a sample of over 600 12th grade students from ethnically diverse backgrounds. We found that adolescents with more in-school friends, compared with out-of-school friends, had higher grade point averages (GPAs) and that adolescents with higher GPAs had more in-school friends. These relations were mediated by academic experiences, including those shared with friends. However, as hypothesized, the social aspects of adolescents' friendships did not vary according to their percent of in-school friends, attesting to the importance of considering both types of friendships in understanding adolescents' social experiences. None of the relations described varied according to gender or ethnicity.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2010	20	3					631	650		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00653.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00653.x													WOS:000280995500005

The data are from 5 waves of data collected from 973 adolescents participating in the control group of a randomized trial. The mean trajectory for psychological dating abuse was positive linear, but the mean trajectories were curvilinear for moderate physical, severe physical, and sexual dating abuse. At all ages, boys reported more severe physical and sexual dating abuse than girls, minorities reported more moderate and severe physical dating abuse than Whites, adolescents in single-parent households reported more psychological and severe physical dating abuse than those in 2-parent-households, and parental education was negatively associated with psychological and moderate physical dating abuse perpetration. The findings have implications for future research and for practice.

Culture: A Possible Predictor of Morality for African American Adolescents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined the ways in which cultural orientation (communalism and material well-being) and empathy influence the moral reasoning of African American middle to late adolescents. Specifically, this study utilized path analysis to investigate Ward's (1995) hypothesis that a communal orientation would promote morality among African American adolescents, while a material well-being orientation would mitigate against it. In addition, it was hypothesized that empathy would mediate the relationship between cultural orientation and moral reasoning. Thirty-seven high school students and 35 college students participated in the study. Results revealed that communalism was a significant predictor of empathy. Despite prediction, communalism and material well-being were not predictors of moral reasoning. The findings did not yield support for empathy functioning as a mediator between communalism and moral reasoning. These findings are discussed in terms of previous findings, methodological limitations, and implications for future research.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2009	19	2					205	215		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00590.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00590.x													WOS:000266243800002

In South Africa, school attendance is compulsory through grade 9, which should be completed before age 16. However, family and social factors such as orphanhood and poverty can hinder educational attainment. Participants were 10,452 16-24-year-olds who completed a South African national representative household survey. Overall, 23% had not completed compulsory school levels. In univariate analyses, school completion was lower among those who had experienced orphanhood during school-age years, males, and those who reported household poverty. In multivariate analyses controlling for household poverty, females who had experienced maternal or paternal orphanhood were less likely to have completed school; orphanhood was not independently associated with males' school completion. Findings highlight the need for evidence-informed policies to address the education and social welfare needs of orphans and vulnerable youth, particularly females, in South Africa.

Identity agents: Parents as active and reflective participants in their children's identity formation	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The paper introduces the concept of identity agents. This concept refers to those individuals who actively interact with children and youth with the intention of participating in their identity formation, and who reflectively mediate larger social influences on identity formation. This contrasts with the focus of mainstream research in the identity field that tends to portray adolescents as the sole reflective agents involved in mature identity development. The paper presents a theoretical analysis presenting the importance of the concept for the formulation of a comprehensive contextual theory of identity formation. The particulars of this concept are illustrated through the presentation of a qualitative report of religious parents actively encouraging their children's processes of identification, co-participating in their children's identity's formation, and reflectively deliberating their parental roles and goals in regards to this process.

The trajectories were then used to predict school dropout and physical violence at age 17. Using a group-based semi-parametric method, two trajectories of prosociality (low and moderate declining) and three trajectories of physical aggression (low, moderate, and high declining) were obtained. Only a small minority (3.4%) of the boys were characterized by both high aggression and moderate prosociality. Physical aggression predicted both school dropout and physical violence, but contrary to expectations, prosocial behavior did not have additive or protective effects.

Two studies were conducted to examine the role that parentification takes in the context of immigration with regard to its impact on adolescent adaptation. In study 1, a comparison between 70 adolescent immigrants from the Former Soviet Union (FSU) in Israel with 70 nonimmigrant Israeli adolescents showed higher levels of spousal role taking among the immigrant adolescents. In the case of the immigrants, spousal role taking was seen to involve positive relationships with both parents (as opposed to with only one for the nonimmigrants) and to be associated with better coping with stressful events. In study 2, the association between the incidence of parentification and family climates was explored among 123 adolescent immigrants from the FSU in Israel. Of the three climates found, the optimal cohesive independence-oriented family climate showed a higher incidence of parentification (parental role taking, spousal role taking, parental role for siblings, and nonspecific adult role taking) as opposed to within the unstructured-conflict-oriented and control-oriented family climates. These results seem to strengthen the position that optimal adolescent development following immigration involves a combination of enhanced familial relatedness and assumption of responsibility within a climate that allows age-appropriate autonomy.

J	Kiesner, J				Kiesner, J			Depressive symptoms in early adolescence: Their relations with classroom problem behavior and peer status	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												It has been suggested that early antisocial behavior plays a causal role in the development of depression during childhood and adolescence through pervasive failures in social competence and social acceptance (Patterson & Capaldi, 1990). The present study was conducted to test this hypothesis by examining longitudinal data from a sample of 215 Italian middle school students. Analyses revealed that Time 1 (T1) problem behavior predicted both Time 2 (T2) peer status and T2 depressive symptoms, even after controlling for T1 peer status and depressive symptoms, respectively. Moreover, T1 peer status predicted depressive symptoms at T2, even after controlling for prior levels of depressive symptoms. However, analyses did not support the hypothesis that peer rejection mediates the effects of problem behavior on depression.																			1050-8392						2002	12	4					463	478		10.1111/1532-7795.00042	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1532-7795.00042													WOS:000179772000004

Although previous research has found that authoritative parenting, as compared with authoritarian, permissive, and disengaged parenting, is associated with positive adolescent outcomes in both European American, middle-class and large multiethnic school-based samples, these parenting categories have not been fully explored in African American families living at or near poverty level. Data were collected from adolescent girls and their self-identified mothers or mother figures using in-home interviews and self-administered questionnaires. Parenting style was found to be significantly related to adolescent outcome in multiple domains including externalizing and internalizing behaviors, academic achievement, work orientation, sexual experience, and pregnancy history. Specifically, teens whose mothers were disengaged (low on both parental warmth and supervision/monitoring) were found to have the most negative outcomes.																			1050-8392						2001	11	2					199	224		10.1111/1532-7795.00010	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1532-7795.00010													WOS:000168838200004

A diverse sample of 60 children, their mothers, and teachers participated. Three types of involvement (school, cognitive, and personal) and levels of autonomy support were assessed during both 6th and 7th grades. Children's motivational resources (perceived competence, control understanding, self-regulation) as well as outcomes of self-worth, grades, and adjustment were also assessed at the 2 time periods. Children whose mothers were higher in cognitive and personal involvement in 6th grade decreased less in perceived competence over the transition relative to those of mothers who were less involved. Children of more autonomy supportive mothers increased less in acting-out and learning problems. Changes in maternal resources were also predictive of changes in motivation and outcomes. The results suggest the importance of the home environment in children's coping with the transition to junior high.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2000	10	4					465	488		10.1207/SJRA1004_05	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/SJRA1004_05													WOS:000168026200004

Specifically, investigators examined whether higher levels of parental monitoring were associated with higher adolescent grade point average, lower levels of adolescent depression, and lower levels of adolescent sexual activity and minor delinquency, and whether these relations were moderated by gender, grade level, or mothers' work status. Participants were 424 7th to 12th graders from a single rural school district in central Pennsylvania. Bivariate correlations indicated that parental monitoring had strong associations with all indicators of adjustment for both boys and girls, with the exception of boys' depression Gender and grade level simultaneously moderated the relation between parental monitoring and adolescent delinquency, with the effect of parental monitoring increasing across grade level for boys, and decreasing with grade level for girls. Furthermore, maternal employment moderated the relation between monitoring and adolescent delinquency and sexual behavior. For both boys and girls, monitoring was a significant predictor of problem behaviors among adolescents whose mothers worked full time. Thus, effective monitoring may compensate for a lack of direct supervision However, gender further moderated these associations. Specifically, the relation between monitoring and adjustment was also significant among girls when their mothers were not working and among boys when mothers worked at least part time.

Subjects included 413 adolescent-parent dyads in which the youth had not begun drinking at the end of 6th grade. All dyads were participants in Project Northland (PN), an adolescent alcohol use prevention trial. A proposed etiologic model including parent norms related to underage drinking, household alcohol-related problems, family problems, and potential mediators of parent influence was tested using structural equation modeling techniques. To explore model differences between intervention conditions, separate models were estimated for intervention and reference samples. Among the parent constructs modeled, parent norms around underage drinking exhibited the strongest relationships with 7th- and 8th-grade alcohol use. Parent norms were directly related to adolescents' alcohol-related cognitions, and thereby had a significant indirect relationship with teenagers' alcohol use. No significant differences were found between intervention and reference groups in model-specified pathways to alcohol use.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2000	10	4					489	514		10.1207/SJRA1004_06	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/SJRA1004_06													WOS:000168026200005

Toward this end, self-report data of 147 11th grade adolescents (60% girls) who listed an older sibling as their closest sibling were analyzed. These analyses indicated that: (a) adolescents' relationships with older siblings were similar to self-reported relationships with mothers, fathers, and peers; (b) a rival hypothesis positing that sibling relationships will be perceived as compensating for low acceptance from parents and peers was not supported by these data; (c) positive sibling relationships contributed to a sense of emotional and school-related support above and beyond the contribution of mother, father, and peer acceptance. Altogether, the findings support the rejection of the compensation hypothesis and the acceptance of the hypothesis regarding the contribution of sibling relationships to adolescents' perceived support. Both findings may be related to the positive relationships that participants of this study have been maintaining with parents and peers.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					1998	8	3					287	308		10.1207/s15327795jra0803_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0803_1													WOS:000076412500001

A total of 204 participants were interviewed; 53 indicated that both of their parents were a source of support or problems, or both, and were, therefore, the focus of this study. This subset of adolescents received significantly more support from their mothers than from their fathers while experiencing equal levels of relationship problems with both parents. Moreover, the support of both mothers and fathers was associated with lower levels of depression. Additionally, paternal support and paternal problems interacted in their association with depression, suggesting that, under conditions of high paternal support, the negative effects of paternal problems are attenuated. Finally, although approximately 60% of this subsample of adolescents did not reside with their fathers, this pattern of results held even after taking father's residential status into consideration. Limitations of using this approach to investigate maternal and paternal relationships among pregnant and parenting adolescents are discussed, as well as implications for future research on parental support.																			1050-8392						1997	7	3					331	348		10.1207/s15327795jra0703_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0703_5								12292603					WOS:A1997XD59200005

This study aimed to assess the effects of different types of parental mediation on adolescents' tendency to use video games to avoid negative emotions and determine the relationship between adolescents' interpersonal skills and their reliance on online video games for escapism. Participants were 452 adolescents from 15 middle and high schools. Data on sociodemographic information, gaming habits, parental control of online gaming, interpersonal skills, and reasons for playing online games were also collected. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to analyze the data, with online video game escapism as the dependent variable. Results supported the study's hypothesis that both parental mediation and adolescent interpersonal skills significantly predict the use of online video games for escapism. Higher levels of parental monitoring were associated with a lower tendency of adolescents to use video games to escape negative emotions, while parental mediation supporting autonomy showed a similar but weaker protective effect. At the same time, parental monitoring was also found to be associated with lower interpersonal skills, notably higher impulsivity, narcissism, and stress in social situations. In addition, adolescents with higher levels of impulsivity were more likely to use video games for escapism. These findings highlight the importance of balanced parental involvement and the development of adolescents' social skills to mitigate the risks of problematic online gaming. Interventions should promote effective parental mediation strategies and enhance adolescents' interpersonal skills to reduce their tendency to use video games as a coping mechanism for real-life challenges. Effective parental mediation and improved interpersonal skills are critical for promoting healthier gaming habits and reducing adolescent escapism.

J	Fix, RL; Thompson, KR; Doan, B				Fix, Rebecca L.; Thompson, Kelli R.; Doan, Brandon			Is there a mental health wake following the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents in a male juvenile prison?	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic loom large in the United States but are particularly of concern in prison settings. In the current study, we examine the ongoing mental health consequences of the pandemic among young people incarcerated in a male juvenile prison. Sequential mixed methods data were obtained-78 young people assigned male at birth completed surveys and 19 completed individual interviews. Seven staff were also interviewed about youth experiences during and following the pandemic. Youth survey results indicated racial and ethnic identity exploration, feeling less safe at night, and experiencing staff harassment were significantly associated with some negative mental health concerns, yet lingering COVID-19 policies were not. Triangulation with interviews underscored these findings by highlighting more specific concerns related to COVID-19, such as social isolation, loneliness, and concerns about the indirect effects the pandemic might have on court outcomes and educational goals. Overall, results of the current analysis provide evidence that incarceration continues to be traumatizing and harmful to youth mental health even following the pandemic. To a lesser extent, these results also imply that lingering effects of the pandemic and concurrent cultural and racial tensions have delayed impacts on the mental health of incarcerated youth during this tumultuous time. Taken together, study findings suggests juvenile prisons must implement readiness plans to mitigate these and other harmful effects of juvenile incarceration in the future.

Disentangling the directionality among cultural stressors and psychosocial outcomes in recently immigrated Hispanic families: A random intercept cross-lagged panel model approach	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Research shows the impact of cultural stressors (e.g. perceived discrimination, bicultural stressors, negative context of reception) on adolescents' psychosocial outcomes. Given the presence of multiple cultural stressors in many Hispanic adolescents' lives, it is essential to examine the (a) developmental sequencing of cultural stressors among recent immigrant youth and (b) predictive effects of cultural stressors on adolescents' psychosocial outcomes. We employed a random intercept cross-lagged panel model to examine the longitudinal interplay among cultural stressors and their effects on youth outcomes using longitudinal data with six waves among 302 recently immigrated Hispanic adolescents (47% girls, Mage = 14.51, SD = .88). We observed bidirectional within-person relations and between-person associations among cultural stressors. At the within-person level, bidirectional cross-lagged effects emerged between perceived discrimination and bicultural stress, between perceived discrimination and negative context of reception, and between negative context of reception and bicultural stress. At the between-person level, bidirectional cross-lagged effects emerged only between perceived discrimination and bicultural stressors. Our findings indicate that cultural stressors explain heterogeneity in psychosocial outcomes: self-esteem was inversely predicted by all cultural stressors, whereas depressive symptoms were predicted only by perceived discrimination. In addition, optimism was predicted only by bicultural stressors, and externalizing behavior was predicted by both bicultural stressors and perceived discrimination. These results suggest that the longitudinal relationships among cultural stressors are (partly) bidirectional. Additionally, cultural stressors demonstrated differential predictive effects on psychosocial outcomes, indicating the added value of considering multiple cultural stressors and their longitudinal effects on adolescents' psychosocial outcomes.

Parenting in African American families: Profiles of general and culturally specific dimensions of parent-adolescent relationships during late adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Developmental and parenting frameworks suggest that factors at the individual-level and multiple levels of adolescents' contexts are important determinants of how African American parents prepare their children to live in a racially stratified society. Using a person-centered approach, this study explored heterogeneity in profiles of African American parent-adolescent relationships (PARs) using indicators of parent-reported ethnic-racial socialization (cultural socialization, preparation for bias), general parenting practices (autonomy support, monitoring, behavioral control), and relationship quality (warmth, communication, conflict). We also examined how adolescents' characteristics, parents' personal and psychological resources, and contextual sources of stress and support contributed to profile membership. Data were from the Maryland Adolescent Development in Context Study (1991-2000) and consisted of 589 African American caregiver-adolescent dyads (caregivers: 89% female; 57.2% married; adolescents: 50.7% female; M-age = 17, SD = 0.64, range = 15-19 years old). Latent profile analysis revealed four profiles: (a) No-Nonsense High Socializers, (b) Indulgent Average Socializers, (c) Unengaged Silent Socializers, and (d) Authoritative Cultural Socializers. Adolescent characteristics (gender, depression, and problem behavior), parents' personal and psychological resources (parenting self-efficacy, centrality, private regard, and depression), and contextual sources of stress and support (stress: economic hardship, family stress, neighborhood disadvantage and support: marital status, family cohesion, family organization) were correlated with profile membership. Findings suggest that variability in African American PARs is shaped by an extensive set of individual and contextual factors related to adolescents and the family and neighborhood context. These findings have important implications for future research and how to target multiple potential levers for change in African American parenting practice.

J	Banati, P				Banati, Prerna			Toward a decolonial developmental science in Asia: Exploring adolescent development in communities from the majority world	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The field of developmental science explores the rich interplay between individuals and their contexts, which dynamically shift across time and place. In Asia, context-specific research and practice are essential for promoting culturally relevant program and policy approaches to improving adolescent well-being. This involves critically examining how localized social structures and power dynamics shape individual experiences and outcomes. The landscape for Asian adolescents today differs significantly from that of previous generations due to rapid changes in these structures, and societal transformation has created the opportunity for traditional and modern values to coexist. This commentary draws across articles from this special issue to describe the dynamics of adolescent-context relations across diverse Asian contexts using developmental science methods. This includes interrogating risk factors, opportunities, and trajectories for adolescents growing up in non-Western settings while also questioning the application of Western, adult-centric discourses on adolescent well-being globally.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2024	34	2			SI		513	516		10.1111/jora.12972	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12972								38973284					WOS:001265146600001

A mixed-methods exploration of autonomy-supportive parenting, confidence, and natural mentoring relationships among Black adolescents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The current study examined whether autonomy-supportive parenting practices may be associated with Black adolescents' quantity of natural mentors (i.e., adults from youths' everyday lives who youth go to for support and guidance) via adolescents' confidence. This study employed survey data from 216 Black youth and qualitative interviews from a subsample of youth (n = 25), their primary caregivers (n = 25), and one nonparental adult relative with whom the youth reported feeling close (n = 25). Comparative analyses were then completed among a subset of 10 family triads corresponding to youth from the qualitative subsample who had the highest (n = 5) and the lowest (n = 5) scores on a survey measure of adolescents' confidence. Study findings suggest that Black adolescents' confidence may be an explanatory link in the association between autonomy-supportive parenting practices among primary caregivers and Black adolescents' quantity of natural mentoring relationships. Moreover, we found that a range of autonomy-supportive parenting practices may be associated with youth confidence, which may, in turn, inform how Black adolescents engage with adults in their social networks.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				SEP	2024	34	3					912	927		10.1111/jora.12970	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12970		MAY 2024						38745543					WOS:001222415400001

Yet, limited longitudinal research have examined peer victimization trajectories over time or the factors associated with left-behind children in China. The purpose of the present study was to examine what, if any, distinct trajectories of peer victimization exist among left-behind children and whether these trajectories are related to school climate, left-behind status, and their interactions. Participants were 853 Chinese left-behind children (Mage = 14.25, SD = 2.39; 43.4% girls) who participated in a four-wave longitudinal study conducted in rural China. Participants reported school climate (indexed by safety and order, acceptance and support, equality and fairness, autonomy and cooperation) at T1 and peer victimization across T1 to T4 spanning 2 years. Latent class growth analyses identified four peer victimization trajectories, including a stably low-decreasing group, a moderate-decreasing group, a high-decreasing group, and an increasing group. Multinomial logistic regression analyses revealed that children who perceived more positive school climate were more likely to exhibit a stably low-decreasing trajectory compared to the other three groups. In addition, among left-behind children who perceived more positive school climate, children with single-parent migrating were more likely to be members of the stably low-decreasing group as compared to those with both-parent migrating. Peer victimization among left-behind children is a concern especially for those who were left behind by both parents and perceived less positive school climate. Targeted school-based interventions and services focused on reducing peer victimization and improving school climate are needed for left-behind children, especially those with both-parent migrating.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				SEP	2024	34	3					818	830		10.1111/jora.12950	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12950		MAY 2024						38708834					WOS:001214895200001

Maternal involvement and adolescents' psychological and academic adjustment after COVID-19 return-to-school: A one-year longitudinal study	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The current study examined the idea that maternal involvement during the COVID-19 school closure period could contribute to the development of adolescents' daily routines, which could ultimately associate with their psychological and academic adjustment after return-to-school. Data were collected from 520 Chinese adolescents (M-age = 12.75 years, SDage = 1.48 years) and their mothers during the COVID-19 school closure and one year after return-to-school. Results indicated that maternal involvement in both education and leisure activities predicted more consistent adolescents' daily routines during the school closure period and then contributed to their more consistent daily routines after return-to-school, resulting in less psychological maladjustment and better academic outcomes. Findings highlight the importance of maternal involvement and daily routines in the context of COVID-19.

Association between adolescents' socioeconomic status and working memory updating functioning: Role of parental educational involvement	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Family socioeconomic status (SES) is positively associated with executive functioning. This study tested whether parental educational involvement mediates this association. Two hundred and sixty, 12-15-year-old adolescents completed working memory updating (WMU) and general intelligence tasks, and questionnaires on SES and parental educational involvement. SES and WMU ability were positively associated; there was no difference between the fathers and mothers for three types of educational involvement. The mothers' behavioural involvement positively mediated the SES-WM updating association, whereas a negative mediation was observed for the mothers' intellectual involvement. The fathers' educational involvement did not play a significant mediating role. These results might inform interventions targeting educational involvement for enhancing the cognitive development of children from low SES families.

Parental Warmth and Developmental Change in Familism Values: Latinx Adolescents in an Emerging Immigrant Community	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined the developmental changes of familism values across adolescence among Latinx adolescents from an emerging immigrant community, and how changes in parental warmth were associated with changes in familism values. The sample included 547 Latinx adolescents. Multilevel model results indicated that familism values showed a linear decline from 6th to 10th grade. Between-person analyses showed that parental warmth was related to the higher initial levels of familism values but unrelated to changes in familism values. At the within-person level, on the occasions when adolescents report higher parental warmth, they also report higher familism values.

Teachers and students were recruited from a public charter high school in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The final sample consisted of 19 students and 10 teachers who participated in face-to-face interviews regarding racial attitudes and racial bias in the academic setting. Three themes emerged among the teacher interviews: rejecting racial inequalities, contradicting thoughts and color-blind explanations, and racially conscious explanations. For the student interviews, two themes emerged: color-blind racial attitudes and witnessing/experiencing bias. These findings yield evidence that color-blind racial attitudes are prevalent in diverse schools among students and teachers, presenting a challenge to intervention efforts in schools aimed at promoting racial justice.

Assessing Youth Disclosure of Police Encounters	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Youth- police encounters are common in the United States, with potentially serious mental health ramifications requiring social supports to cope. Still, no research has examined youth disclosure of these experiences to others. Using a national sample of youth stopped by police (N = 918; 56.09% Black, 20.48% Hispanic), we find that more than twothirds disclosed police encounters-most commonly to mothers. Even so, disclosure became less likely as perceptions of procedural injustice, social stigma, and legal cynicism increased. Among youth who disclosed stops but not to parents, disclosure to friends was common (61.18%), whereas disclosure to nonparent adults was not. Enhanced training for teachers, school counselors, and community leaders may improve youth outcomes by facilitating additional opportunities for disclosure and support.

Normative Beliefs about Social Withdrawal in Adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The goal of this study is to explore normative beliefs about social withdrawal during adolescence. Participants were N = 419 adolescents (M-age = 16.13 years), who completed measures of normative beliefs about social withdrawal and their own social withdrawal (shyness, unsociability). Among the results, adolescents reported greater overall acceptance of unsociability compared to shyness, however, some gender differences also emerged. Specifically, adolescents were more accepting of unsociability when depicted by hypothetical females, and more accepting of shyness when depicted by hypothetical males. Participant social withdrawal was associated with greater acceptance of socially withdrawn behaviors in others.

The participants were 390 Finnish lower secondary school pupils. Latent profile analysis revealed five classes of discrepancy profiles; adolescents with congruent perceptions, quite congruent perceptions, and positively discrepant perceptions of SC reported lower scores of depressive symptoms, whereas those with negatively and extremely positively discrepant perceptions of SC reported the highest scores of depressive symptoms. The larger the discrepancy between self- and others' evaluations of SC were, the more depressive symptoms were reported.

Gay-Straight Alliances, Inclusive Policy, and School Climate: LGBTQ Youths' Experiences of Social Support and Bullying	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Gay-Straight Alliances (GSA) and school policies focused on support for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning youth may reduce bias-based bullying and enhance social supports in schools. Using multivariate regression, we tested the relationship between youth reports of the presence of GSAs and LGBTQ-focused policies, independently and mutually, with experiences bullying and perceived support (n = 1,061). Youth reported higher classmate support in the presence of GSAs and higher teacher support in the presence of LGBTQ-focused policies; the presence of both GSAs and LGBTQ-focused policies was associated with less bullying and higher perceived classmate and teacher support. The findings indicate that GSAs and LGBTQ-focused policies are distinctly and mutually important for fostering safer and more supportive school climates for youth.

Longitudinal Associations Between Adolescents' Bullying-Related Indirect Defending, Outsider Behavior, and Peer-Group Status	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												During adolescence, youth become more likely to avoid involvement in witnessed bullying and less likely to support victims. It is unknown whether-and how-these bystander behaviors (i.e., outsider behavior and indirect defending) are associated with adolescents' peer-group status (i.e., popularity and social acceptance) over time. Cross-lagged path modeling was used to examine these longitudinal associations in a sample of 313 Dutch adolescents (Mage-T1 = 10.3 years). The results showed that status longitudinally predicted behavior, rather than that behavior predicted status. Specifically, unpopularity predicted outsider behavior and social acceptance predicted indirect defending. These findings suggest that a positive peer-group status can trigger adolescents' provictim stance. However, adolescents may also strategically avoid involvement in witnessed bullying to keep a low social profile.					; Pronk, Jeroen/V-3937-2017	Vermande, Marjolijn/0000-0002-2138-9452; Olthof, Tjeert/0000-0002-4965-1555; Pronk, Jeroen/0000-0002-4397-6527													1050-8392	1532-7795				JAN	2020	30			1			87	99		10.1111/jora.12450	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12450								30156740					WOS:000508756700008

Coming Closer in Adolescence: Convergence in Mother, Father, and Adolescent Reports of Parenting	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Parent-child relationships change during adolescence. Furthermore, parents and adolescents perceive parenting differently. We examined the changes in perceptions of parental practices in fathers, mothers, and adolescents during adolescence. Furthermore, we investigated if fathers', mothers', and adolescents' perceptions converge during adolescence. Following 497 families across six waves (ages 13-18), we investigated the development of parental support and behavioral control using mother and father self-reports, and adolescent reports for mothers and fathers. We found curvilinear decrease for support and control. Parent-adolescent convergence emerged over the 6 years: those with higher intercepts had a steeper decrease, whereas correlations among parent and adolescent reports increased. This multi-informant study sheds light on the development of parent-adolescent convergence on perceptions of parenting.

The ethnic diversity of students' middle school was examined as a moderator. Participants were 1,825 Latino sixth graders from 26 ethnically diverse urban middle schools. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that a change in ethnic representation toward fewer Latinos in middle school than elementary school was related to less perceived belonging and lower achievement in schools with low ethnic diversity. There were no mean differences as a function of declining representation in more diverse middle schools, suggesting that greater school diversity was protective. Findings highlight the importance of examining school ethnic context, especially across the middle school transition.

Considering the Role of Peer and Teacher Gender	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study builds on research on the power of counter-stereotypical cues, as well as intergroup contact theory, to consider whether interactions with a female teacher and female peers in a high school engineering classroom decrease male students' gender/science, technology, engineering, and math stereotypical beliefs and whether this varies according to the initial strength of their stereotypical views. Analyses reveal that among male students who initially reject stereotypes of male superiority, more female peers in the classroom leads to a further decrease in their stereotypical views by the end of the year. In contrast, boys who held strong stereotypical beliefs became less stereotypical by the end of the course when they had a female teacher.

Based on a survey of 49,172 ninth- and eleventh-grade students in Stockholm (2006-2014), structural equationmodeling results demonstrated negative associations between parental and teacher support on psychosomatic health complaints. Parental support had a stronger association with the outcome among girls than boys. It was also more important than teacher support for psychosomatic health complaints. Parental support was more important for younger girls' health compared to older girls, with opposite patterns for teacher support.

A school-based sample of 487 adolescents (58% girls; M-age=14.1) participated at two time points, one year apart. Participants reported (1) proportions of daily communication with romantic partners via traditional modes (in person, on the phone) versus technological modes (text messaging, social networking sites) and (2) competence in the romantic relationship skill domains of negative assertion and conflict management. Results of cross-lagged panel models indicated that adolescents who engaged in greater proportions of technology-based communication with romantic partners reported lower levels of interpersonal competencies one year later, but not vice versa; associations were particularly strong for boys.

Based on 634 monozygotic and dizygotic twins (336 females) assessed in Grades 6 and 7, anxiety symptoms and sibling relationship quality were measured with self-report questionnaires. The predictive association of the co-twin's level of anxiety with adolescents' own increased anxiety 1year later was only observed in same-sex twin dyads (monozygotic and dizygotic) and was higher for those who perceived a higher level of relationship quality with their co-twin. Raising awareness of a possible sibling contagion of anxiety may be useful for preventing the development of anxiety symptoms in youth.

Extant literature has mostly addressed the adverse emotional and behavioral outcomes of exposure while failing to examine change over time in social cognitive factors in contexts of ethno-political conflict. Using cohort sequential longitudinal data, this study examines ethnic variation in the development of negative stereotypes about ethnic outgroups among Palestinian (n = 600), Israeli Jewish (n = 451), and Israeli Arab (n = 450) youth over 3 years. Age and exposure to ethno-political violence were included as covariates for these trajectories. Findings indicate important ethnic differences in trajectories of negative stereotypes about ethnic outgroups, as well as variation in how such trajectories are shaped by prolonged ethno-political conflict.

Stochastic actor-based models for network dynamics are applied to test our hypotheses based on longitudinal friendship nominations of 406 Taiwanese adolescents in mixed-gender, all-boy, and all-girl classes. The results show that adolescents strive for closure through connections of friends' friends. Further, the results reveal that while the tendency toward closure is stronger for girls in mixed-gender classes, such tendency toward closure is stronger in all-boy classes than in all-girl classes. Testing effects between types of classes supports the indications of variances in striving closure.

Daily Associations Between Drinking and Sex Among College Students: A Longitudinal Measurement Burst Design	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Daily links between alcohol use and sexual behaviors were examined in a longitudinal study of college students. Hierarchical linear models predicted sexual behaviors by characteristics of persons (N=731, Level 3), semesters (N=4,345, Level 2), and days (N=56,372, Level 1). On a given day, consuming more drinks and binge drinking were associated with greater odds of kissing, touching, oral sex, and penetrative sex. Consistent with alcohol myopia and expectancy theories, associations between binge drinking and sexual behaviors were stronger for students not in romantic relationships, for students with stronger alcohol-sex expectancies, and for oral and penetrative sex. Findings suggest that within-day links between alcohol use and sexual behaviors are evident across college, with variations based on individual and relationship factors.					, Jennifer/HPD-4891-2023; Patrick, Megan/A-2212-2008	Maggs, Jennifer L/0000-0003-1601-6990; Patrick, Megan/0000-0003-3594-4944													1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2015	25	2					377	386		10.1111/jora.12135	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12135								26052189					WOS:000354739200013

Using a peer nomination technique in a sample of incarcerated females (N=86, age 15-24years), our study is the first to examine the association between peer status and psychopathology in a correctional facility. Results indicated that a key indicator of likeability was prosocial behavior; popularity was related to leadership; and social impact was associated with aggression.

In a sample of 796 African American adolescents from the MADICS study, girls were found to have much higher GPAs and test scores compared with boys. Girls reported receiving more monitoring, communication, and rule enforcement, but less autonomy in decision making than later-born boys. Mothers also reported higher expectations for girls than boys. A significant percent of the GPA and test score gap was accounted for by the parenting differences in both married and single mother-headed households. It was concluded that reducing differential parenting could help narrow gender differences in achievement among African American adolescents.

Associations of Mothers' Friendship Quality with Adolescents' Friendship Quality and Emotional Adjustment	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Little research has examined the association of parents' friendships with adolescent's well-being, perhaps because the association was considered too distal. However, developmental theories suggest that contexts in which parents, but not their children, are situated may be related to child development (Bronfenbrenner, , ). The current work examined associations between the quality of mothers' own friendships and their adolescent children's friendship quality and emotional adjustment. Fifth-, eighth-, and eleventh-graders (N=172) whose mothers' friendships were characterized by conflict and antagonism reported having friendships that were high in negative friendship qualities as well as elevated internalizing symptoms. These associations held after controlling for mother-child relationship quality, suggesting that mothers' friendships may have a unique association with adolescents' adjustment.

How Popularity and Friendships Shape Antipathy Networks of Adolescents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined how status (popularity) and friendship relations affected the development of adolescents' dislike relations (i.e., antipathy networks) over time. Three competing hypotheses were formulated about the role of status: antipathy relations result from either similarity in status (competition hypothesis) or dissimilarity in status when lower status peers reject higher status peers (envy hypothesis) or vice versa (snobbism hypothesis). Hypotheses were tested in a longitudinal sample of adolescents from Chile (fifth to sixth grade; 52% boys; N=273). Antipathy and friendship networks were examined simultaneously using longitudinal social network modeling (SIENA). Higher status adolescents were more likely to reject their lower status peers, in line with the snobbism hypothesis. Furthermore, best friends tended to agree upon which peers to reject over time.

The Moderating Role of Peer-Valued Characteristics	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Adolescents rejected by peers are often targets of bullying. However, peer rejection is not a sure path to victimization. We examined whether characteristics valued by peers (i.e., attractiveness, wealth, academic, and athletic ability) moderated the relationship between peer rejection and victimization. We predicted rejected adolescents high on peer-valued characteristics (PVCs) would receive fewer nominations for being victimized than adolescents with lower levels. Canadian students in Grades 610 (N = 549; Mage = 13.32, SD = 1.50) provided peer nominations for peer victimization, rejection, attractiveness, wealth, and academic and athletic competence. As hypothesized, each PVC moderated the relationship between peer rejection and peer victimization. No sex differences were found. This study demonstrates the buffering effects of nonbehavioral characteristics valued by peers.

Racial Barrier Socialization and the Well-Being of African American Adolescents: The Moderating Role of Mother-Adolescent Relationship Quality	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Racial socialization has been suggested as an important factor in helping African American adolescents cope effectively with racism and discrimination. Although multiple studies have reported a positive link between racial pride socialization and psychological adjustment among African American youth, assessments of the association between adolescent adjustment and another dimension of racial socialization-racial barrier socialization-have yielded inconsistent findings. Using a sample of 190 African American adolescents, the present study focuses on the quality of mother-adolescent relationships as an indicator of affective context, and examines its moderating influence on the association between racial barrier socialization and adolescent adjustment. Regression analyses indicated that the link between racial barrier socialization and adolescent adjustment is moderated by mother-adolescent relationship quality. However, these associations varied by gender.

In childhood, all profiles had high rates of shared television viewing, but some were oriented toward in-home activities and others toward activities outside the home (e.g., cultural events). These latter profiles tended to be higher in socioeconomic advantage, and the young people in them tended to demonstrate greater gains in math, but not reading, achievement across the transition into adolescence. In adolescence, shared activity profiles favored low amounts of shared time between parents and adolescents across activities and disfavored shared time in public domains.

Exploring differences in work (both noneconomic household work and labor market work) and leisure time among adolescents according to school enrollment status, we examine the implications of school enrollment for adolescent development. Consistent differences in time use patterns exist between students and nonstudents across a range of settings. Students spend many fewer hours than nonstudents in work activities and the type of work they do is primarily domestic. Although females carry a heavier workload and enjoy less leisure time than males during their adolescent years regardless of enrollment status, the distribution of their time and the types of activities they participate in are much more similar to their male peers when they are students.																			1050-8392						2008	18	1					99	120		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2008.00552.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2008.00552.x													WOS:000253480300005

The purpose of this structural equation modeling analysis was to test a biobehavioral model in which postpartum self-competence mediated pathways from anxiety and cortisol during pregnancy to anxiety 3 years later. Self-reports of anxiety and self-competence and salivary cortisol samples were obtained from 78 healthy primiparous and 57 nonpregnant comparison adolescent girls matched for age and socioeconomic status. Assessments were done during the first half of pregnancy, 3-4 weeks after childbirth, and at a 3-year follow up. For pregnant girls, linkages from initial anxiety to self-competence to follow-up anxiety were significant and negative, as hypothesized. Direct and indirect pathways between initial and follow-up anxiety were significant. Cortisol levels did not predict self-competence or anxiety. For nonpregnant adolescents, the model fit poorly. Findings suggest self-competence may play a mediating role in young mothers' anxiety across time.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2005	15	4					625	655		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2005.00114.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2005.00114.x													WOS:000233518500015

This study examined family life risk factors (socioeconomic status, family stress, and parental involvement in education) and how their effects on teen childbearing risk varied, depending on the childhood age at which they were experienced. Prospective life history data from the National Child Development Study of Great Britain were used to study a birth cohort of 4,928 British women, 15.3% of who became pregnant as teens. This study demonstrated that data from early childhood significantly contribute to the understanding of teen childbearing risk.

J	Crockett, LJ; Bingham, CR				Crockett, LJ; Bingham, CR			Anticipating adulthood: Expected timing of work and family transitions among rural youth	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined family and individual processes influencing the future expectancies of adolescents (N = 345) from an economically stressed rural community. The anticipated timing and sequencing of key role transitions (school completion, job entry, marriage, and parenthood) were examined for each gender. In addition, factors contributing to individual differences in expected timing were examined, and gender differences in predictors were tested. Results indicated that rural adolescents' expectancies about adult role transitions diverged somewhat from societal norms with respect to timing. Family background and relationships, adolescents' attitudes and behaviors, and educational aspirations all contributed to individual differences in expected timing, with somewhat different factors being salient for boys and girls. These findings provide clues to the psychological processes linking adolescent experiences to the construction of the adult life course.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2000	10	2					151	172																WOS:000086241200002

In Study 1, an older subjective age among 15-year-old girls and boys was correlated significantly and positively with several problem behaviors (e.g., substance use), behavioral autonomy, and aspects of peer relationships such as association with deviant peers and involvement with other-sex peers. In Study 2, data from 9- to 17-year-old adolescents revealed that after controlling for chronological age and pubertal status, subjective age was related significantly to several measures of self-reported problem behavior, behavioral autonomy, and peer relationships. The relations between subjective age and boys' problem behaviors and deviant peer association were curvilinear. The highest levels of these behaviors were reported by boys who felt markedly older than their chronological ages, compared to boys with younger subjective ages. These studies support the notion that subjective age is an indicator of perceived maturity that has at least as much import as chronological age and pubertal status for understanding adolescents' passage to adulthood.					, Jennifer/HPD-4891-2023														1050-8392						1999	9	3					309	337		10.1207/s15327795jra0903_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0903_4													WOS:000082363900004

It was hypothesized that: (a) EPTA would be related to ethnic identity, social perspective-taking ability (SMA), and ethnic socialization; and (b) there would be distinctiveness in EMA relative to SPTA. Mexican American high school students (N = 43) were administered in-depth EPTA and SPTA interviews and questionnaire measures of ethnic identity. Parents of the adolescents were administered an ethnic socialization questionnaire. Results provided support for the potential usefulness of EPTA because it was significantly associated with SPTA, even after variance associated with developmental level was controlled, and there was variance in ethnic identity predicted by EPTA that was not also predicted by either SPTA or the ethnic socialization variable. Contrary to expectation, EMA was not significantly associated with ethnic socialization. However, parental ethnic socialization was significantly predictive of ethnic identity development. The results support a model of ethnic identity development during adolescence integrated across socialization and cognitive-developmental factors.

Using cluster analysis, five different sexual styles were identified: Sexually Naive, Sexually Unassured, Sexually Competent, Sexually Adventurous, and Sexually Driven. These styles were characterized by differences in gender, age, and virginity status. The styles, however, were not simply delineated along demographic lines, indicating the efficacy of examining patterns of sexual self characteristics rather than single variables to explore adolescent sexuality. The sexual styles also differed in their levels of sexual risk-taking with both casual and regular partners, number of sexual partners in the last 6 months, and number of ''one-night-stands.'' These differences were coherent with the sexual styles and thus offered both concurrent validity for the styles and an indication that these styles may be associated with sexual behavior. To understand adolescent sexual behavior and sexual risk-taking, it is essential to consider the ways in which young people construct a sense of themselves as sexual beings.																			1050-8392						1996	6	4					489	513																WOS:A1996VT15100007

Life stressors and social resources were unrelated to disease outcomes. According to both self-reports and mothers' reports, however, youth who experienced more acute negative events and chronic life stressors and a lack of stable social resources showed worse psychosocial functioning. Parental resources moderated the relation of acute and chronic stressors to psychosocial functioning; in this group of youth with a chronic physical illness, parental support was more beneficial when there were fewer additional stressors.																			1050-8392						1995	5	3					361	385		10.1207/s15327795jra0503_4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0503_4													WOS:A1995QZ52200004
J	Maggs, JL				Maggs, Jennifer L.			John Schulenberg as a developmental scholar and mentor: Personal reflections	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												John Schulenberg has had significant impact on developmental science. His conceptual writing and empirical research, grounded in developmental contextualism, emphasized the critical role that developmental transitions play in shaping health risks, especially substance use, across the life course. Schulenberg's integration of developmental concepts with large-scale epidemiological studies, particularly through his leadership in the Monitoring the Future study, provides key insights into how significant life changes-such as school transitions, employment, and relationships-interact to influence well-being across adolescence and early adulthood. He was a fierce advocate for adolescence and young adulthood being critical phases of life, deserving of focused attention and support. John was also a devoted mentor to the next generation of developmental scientists. This commentary reflects on John Schulenberg's legacy, highlighting five of his foundational concepts (developmental tasks, transitions, trajectories, turning points, and timing) and celebrating his role as a generative and joyful mentor. He fostered open intellectual dialog, promoted and celebrated career development, and took pleasure in life inside and outside work, helping early career scientists to develop innovative and impactful research programs. Schulenberg's commitment to positive relationships and celebrating success is an enduring model for future generations of developmental scientists and mentors.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				2024 OCT 22	2024										10.1111/jora.13024	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.13024		OCT 2024						39439257					WOS:001338023200001

The contribution of chronic peer victimization in elementary school to depressive symptoms in adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Throughout his career, John Schulenberg challenged us to understand adolescent development as the confluence of distal and proximal experiences along with critical transitions. Heeding this call, we examined whether chronic childhood peer victimization predicted adolescents' depressive symptoms via early-emerging depression growth trajectories, continued victimization into adolescence, and stress-amplification at the middle school transition. Self-reported depressive symptoms and teacher-reported and self-reported peer victimization were obtained from 636 youth (338 girls; Mage = 7.96 years, 66.7% White, 21.7% Black, 11.6% other) in the 2nd-9th grades. Latent growth curve analyses revealed that, by 7th grade, chronic childhood peer victimization was associated with depressive symptoms only through an indirect association with peer victimization in adolescence, underscoring how interrelated historical and ongoing interpersonal stressors contribute to adolescent psychopathology.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				2024 JUL 1	2024										10.1111/jora.12997	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12997		JUL 2024						38946334					WOS:001258315900001

The COVID-19 pandemic, however, impacted the full family system in ways that were unprecedented. Scholars of adolescence worldwide were driven to understand how adolescents' relationships with family members changed due to these dramatic societal shifts and the influence these relationships had on adolescents' well-being. This systematic review examined two research questions with 189 articles published from 2020-2022: (1) How has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted families with adolescents, including broader family functioning, family relationship qualities, and parenting? and (2) How has the pandemic or pandemic-related stressors interacted with family functioning, family relationships, and parenting of adolescents to impact adolescent well-being and adjustment? Additionally, examination of the relevant studies were divided into sub-themes of pandemic influence: (a) family environment and routines, (b) family difficulties, (c) parenting and parent-adolescent relationships, and (d) sibling relationships.

They are at increased risk for developmental problems and family dysfunction. However, we currently know little regarding their support systems at school. Using daily data over five school days from 90 adolescents (Mage = 13.70) in rural China, this study investigated daily associations linking teacher and peer support to school belonging, and how these associations varied by parental migration. Teacher but not peer support was positively associated with same-day school belonging. However, this association was attenuated for adolescents with longer duration and history of parental migration. The findings highlighted the importance of considering school settings and within-group variations for left-behind adolescents.

Unconditional growth model tests provided evidence of significant changes in the three parenting behaviors and in deviance over time. Multivariate growth model tests showed that declines in maternal knowledge were associated with increases in deviance, while greater increases in parental peer approval were associated with slower increases in deviance. Findings provide evidence of dynamic changes in parental solicitation, knowledge, and peer approval over time, as well as in deviance; additionally, they importantly show how parental knowledge and peer approval covary developmentally with deviance.

Variable-centered results revealed EMWS were only indirectly (through CEWS) associated with depressive and anxious symptoms. Person-centered outcomes allowed to identify four different profiles based on EMWS and CEWS, which differed on depressive and anxious symptoms.

The social, emotional, and behavioral skill antecedents to college students' volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The disruptions to community functioning caused by the COVID-19 pandemic spurred individuals to action. This empirical study investigated the social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skill antecedents to college students' volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemic (N = 248, Mage = 20.6). We assessed eight SEB skills at the onset of a volunteering program, and students' volunteer hours were assessed 10-weeks later. Approximately 41.5% of the sample did not complete any volunteer hours. Higher levels of perspective taking skill, abstract thinking skill, and stress regulation were associated with more time spent volunteering. These results suggest that strength in particular SEB skills can prospectively predict prosocial civic behaviors.

This commentary updates and expands Sociopolitical Development Theory by Watts and Flanagan (Journal of Community Psychology, 35, 2007, 1), elaborating on elements of the theory and linking them to liberation praxis. Expansion included research of the interplay of social identity and Critical Social Analysis (CSA) (i.e., the deconstruction of oppression's causes and effects through a political lens). This exploratory, qualitative project analyzed narratives written by young adults seeking admission to a training program for community-organizers. The result was a framework of "Viewpoints " relevant to programming for adolescents. Sample quotes illustrate how combinations of CSA and social identities can enrich sociopolitical development and are enriched by intersectionalities.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				DEC	2022	32	4					1270	1279		10.1111/jora.12811	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12811								36519421					WOS:000898850500001

In individual interviews, 77 adolescents (M age = 16.49 years; 39 girls, 38 boys) in Bogota, Colombia, responded to hypothetical vignettes wherein a rival group at school engaged in a transgression against their group. Adolescents reported that students who were harmed should and would talk to school authorities, but also noted they would likely retaliate. In terms of teacher-sanctioned responses to harm, youth endorsed compensation most strongly, followed by apologies, and rated suspension least positively. Youths' explanations for their endorsement of different disciplinary practices reflected varied concerns, including their perceptions of how justice is best achieved and how restoration could be attained.

Ninety-six adolescents from 6th grade (M = 11.9 years), 11th grade (M = 16.6 years), and college (M = 20.5 years), from Colombia-a country with high levels of corruption-evaluated how morally right and acceptable were bribery and nepotism across a baseline condition without sociocultural information, and three experimental conditions including sociocultural beliefs about illegality, institutional illegitimacy, and survival. Results suggest that compared to the baseline, the sociocultural beliefs in the three experimental conditions lead to more positive and tolerant evaluations, and less severity and more acceptability towards corruption in different degrees.

Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that, among Black girls (N= 308), racial discrimination experiences and racial barrier socialization messages were positively associated with SBW endorsement. However, there was no significant interaction between racial discrimination and racial barrier messages in predicting SBW endorsement. Our analyses also revealed that SBW was not directly associated with internalizing symptoms (e.g., anxiety and depression symptoms). Furthermore, there was no significant interaction between racial discrimination and SBW endorsement in predicting internalizing symptoms. Findings provide evidence of and clarity on how sociocultural experiences shape SBW development and highlight a need to better understand how SBW endorsement functions in the mental health of Black girls.

Parenting Practices, Autonomous Motivation, and Adolescent Diet Habits	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Guided by self-determination theory, the aim of this study was to examine whether adolescents' autonomous motivation for making healthy diet choices mediates the association between parenting practices regarding diet and adolescent food choices. We analyzed data from the NCI FLASHE study, a survey of demographically diverse parents and their adolescent children (N = 1,646 dyads). Path models supported self-determination theory's assertion that indirect, encouraging parenting practices fostered internal motivation; in contrast, regulation was both positively and negatively linked to motivation depending on the model. Models also yielded direct paths between parenting practices and healthy and unhealthy diet choices. Overall, regardless of what predicted motivation, adolescents' autonomous motivation was linked with their consumption of healthier foods and drinks. As such, cultivating a sense of internal motivation during these formative years may put young people on a path toward healthy patterns of self-regulation later in life.

Maternal Buffering of Adolescent Dysregulation in Socially Appetitive Contexts: From Behavior to the Brain	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Adolescents are more susceptible to dysregulation in positive social contexts, compared to children. We investigated whether maternal presence would buffer these effects in adolescence. Fifty-four adolescents and children (age range = 8-17 years, M-age = 13.38 years) completed a social go-nogo task during an fMRI scan alone and in the presence of their mother. We found age-related patterns, such that older relative to younger youth displayed more disinhibition toward socially appetitive than socially aversive stimuli, which was buffered by maternal presence. Furthermore, with age, maternal buffering in socially appetitive contexts elicited heightened activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex connectivity. Findings underscore the importance of caregivers in promoting the neural regulation of their offspring during adolescence.

The effects of mutual versus one-sided help relations on friendship initiation and maintenance, and vice versa, were examined. Friendship and help networks were analyzed (N = 953 students; 41 classrooms; M-age = 12.7). The results illustrate that friendship and help networks show some similarities, but only partly overlap and have distinct characteristics.

We examined the "tightknittedness" of their friendship groups by testing whether adolescent friendship groups' average levels of or variability in internalizing symptoms predict group cohesiveness. We used four waves (9th-12th grades) of survey and social network data on 3,013 friendship groups from the PROmoting School-Community-University Partnerships to Enhance Resilience study. Friendship groups with higher average depressive symptoms were less cohesive; groups with higher average anxiety symptoms had greater reciprocity. Groups with greater variability in depressive symptoms had greater density; variability in anxiety symptoms was not consistently associated with cohesion. The friendship groups of depressed adolescents appear less cohesive than the "typical" adolescent friendship group.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				FEB	2020	30			2			391	402		10.1111/jora.12484	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12484								30758095					WOS:000518217500008

Drawing on longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents, the current investigation examined the extent to which money lending practices, feelings of financial resentment, and exposure to economic control contribute to couple-level interactions, and in turn, to conflict that escalates to the point of violence. Findings provide evidence of an association between adolescent financial behaviors and concurrent conflict due to economic considerations. Moreover, conflict due to economic considerations was an important predictor of future adolescent relationship abuse perpetration.

Guided by the expectancy-value framework, we hypothesized that students' motivation beliefs and achievement outcomes in mathematics are fostered by teachers' emphasis on the relevance of mathematics and constrained by gender-based differential treatment. To examine these questions, structural equation modeling was applied to a longitudinal panel of 518 female students from the Maryland Adolescent Development in Context Study. While controlling for prior achievement and race, gendered differential treatment was negatively associated with math beliefs and achievement, whereas relevant math instruction was positively associated with these outcomes.

The concept of telos is employed to define thriving as continued growth through strength-based living that leads to contributing to one's communities and living out one's ethical ideals. Virtue development is proposed as a primary process by which R/S promotes thriving. Virtues are defined as hybrid personality units emerging when characteristic adaptations are given meaning by a transcendent narrative identity. R/S contributes to virtue formation through the ideological, social, and transcendent contexts embedded within religion by providing opportunities to grow both the characteristic adaptations and transcendent narrative identities necessary for virtue formation in youth and, ultimately, thriving.

Yet, little psychological theory or data are available to guide our understanding of what messages regarding social class are transmitted within and across generations and how those transmissions are most likely to occur. As a launching point for such work, we focus this initial contextual and largely theoretical review on parent-adolescent socialization of social class in low-income, White families of adolescents in particular. To this end, our goal was to raise potential hypotheses about the implicit and explicit ways that White low-income parents may shape adolescent views of class, as well as the meaning and implications of status socialization for adolescent health and well-being.

Student-Perceived Mothers' and Fathers' Beliefs, Mathematics and English Motivations, and Career Choices	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												According to Eccles and Jacobs' (1986) parent socialization model, parents' gendered ability and value beliefs influence girls' and boys' interpretations of those beliefs, and hence students' domain-specific valuing of tasks and competence beliefs and subsequent career plans. Studies have rarely analyzed how both student-perceived mothers' and fathers' beliefs affect girls' and boys' task values, success expectancies, and career plans across domains. This study analyzed survey data of 459 students (262 boys) assessed through Grades 9, 10, and 11 from three coeducational secondary schools in Sydney, Australia. Longitudinal structural equationmodels revealed gendered value transmission pathways for girls in mathematics. Although mathematics test scores did not vary statistically significantly, girls reported statistically significantly lower mothers' ability beliefs for them in mathematics than boys at Time 1, which led to their statistically significantly lower mathematics intrinsic value at Time 2 and mathematics-related career plans at Time 3. Such gendered pathways did not occur in English. Matched same-gender effects and gendered pathways in parent socialization processes were evident; perceived mothers' value beliefs were more strongly related to girls' than boys' importance values in English. Student-perceived fathers' ability beliefs positively predicted boys', not girls', importance value in mathematics. Implications for educational practice emphasize the need to target girls' and boys' interest when aiming to enhance their mathematical career motivations.

Genetic factors contributed to 55% of the variance in AC and between 43 and 58% of the variance in anxiety. Negative phenotypic associations between AC and anxiety indicated that lower attentional ability is related to increased risk for all 4 anxiety categories. Genetic correlations between AC and anxiety phenotypes ranged from -.36 to -.47, with evidence of nonshared environmental covariance between AC and generalized and separation anxiety. Results suggest that AC is a phenotypic and genetic risk factor for anxiety in early adolescence, with somewhat differing levels of risk depending on symptomatology.

At the second assessment, participants also provided self-reports of parent and peer attachment and 3days of cortisol samples. Current stress was associated with heightened CAR for both males and females, whereas past stress was associated with attenuated CAR for males. Attachment to peers buffered the relationship between past stress and attenuated CAR for all adolescents; attachment to parents was a buffer for male adolescents only.

Internalizing Symptoms, Peer Substance Use, and Substance Use Initiation	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study used longitudinal survey and social network data covering sixth through ninth grades to test whether internalizing symptoms make early adolescents more prone to (1) exposure to and (2) influence by substance-using peers. Random effects regressions revealed that increases in symptoms were significantly associated with increases in the proportion of friends who used cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana; some associations weakened across grades. Event history models revealed that the effect of friends' smoking on smoking initiation decreased as internalizing symptoms increased; symptoms did not moderate the effects of friends' alcohol and marijuana use on alcohol and marijuana use initiation. These findings counter the influence hypothesis of the co-occurrence of internalizing symptoms with substance use and partly support the exposure hypothesis.

Triangulation and Parent-Adolescent Relationships: Implications for Adolescent Dating Competence and Abuse	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study focuses on family predictors of conflict behavior in adolescent dating relationships, drawing on family systems and socialization perspectives. Mother-adolescent, father-adolescent, and triadic relationships each was examined as predictors of adolescent dating outcomes that hold importance for developmental and prevention science (positive conflict resolution, verbal abuse, and physical abuse). We conducted a longitudinal analysis using a 6-month longitudinal design with 236 ethnically diverse high school students. Findings indicate that triangulation into parental conflicts was related to increases in positive conflict resolution and with increases in verbally abusive behavior with dating partners over time. Parent-adolescent closeness and conflict each was related to positive conflict resolution and verbal abuse, but these associations were only found for boys.

Disengaged or Bookworm: Academics, Mental Health, and Success for Sexual Minority Youth	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Same-sex attracted youth (SSAY) experience higher rates of negative mental health outcomes compared with their heterosexual peers; however, the association between sexual minority status and academic achievement is less clear. We used four waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to compare 1,279 ethnically diverse SSAY (57% male) based on the degree to which they were "engaged" (65%) or "disengaged" (35%) in school, classified through cluster analysis techniques. The pattern of results indicated significantly better mental health among the engaged group one and 6 years later (e.g., fewer depressive symptoms, less alcohol use), and more occupational and educational achievement eleven years later. The implications of school connection and achievement across a decade of life are discussed.

Considerations of a Dual-Systems Model of Cognitive Development and Risky Driving	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The dual-systems model of adolescent risk-taking postulates that risk-taking during adolescence partially results from an imbalance in the development of the executive and the socio-emotional cognitive systems. While supported by behavioral and neuroanatomical data, translational research linking the model with real-world driving or laboratory driving simulation is sparse. This article discusses the model as it relates to adolescent driving and reviews empirical studies that have applied it in a driving-specific context. While the studies reviewed provided partial support, each lacked a critical component necessary to fully test the model. Thus, a strong test has yet to be implemented; however, the dual-systems model holds promise for advancing the understanding of teen driving risk and guiding applications for prevention and policy.

The articles in this special section show how this is vital for theory and research in today's diverse and changing world, and for interventions with adolescents within and across countries. The articles by Diers, Kagitcibasi, and Way, based on their addresses at the 2012 Meeting of the Society for Research on Adolescence, elaborate on the meeting theme of Culture and Context. Here, we give a precis of the articles and then discuss how they exemplify our three intellectual goals for the 2012 meeting. Specifically, we aimed for breadth in regard to development, culture, and context. We end by noting novel synergies that emerged among the articles.					chen, xinyu/HNR-2708-2023														1050-8392						2013	23	2			SI		197	200		10.1111/jora.12046	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12046													WOS:000319332400001

Ego Development, Ego Strengths, and Ethnic Identity Among First Nation Adolescents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Three conceptualizations of psychosocial development were investigated among Canadian First Nation adolescents. Loevinger's social cognitive model of ego development reflects the way in which an individual views the self and social reality. From Eriksonian theory, ego strengths refer to the emergent values or outcomes that represent resolution of the eight psychosocial stages of development, and ethnic identity is a domain of personal identity with special relevance for minorities. As expected, age and biological gender differences were found for ego development. Associations between ego development and ego strengths were supported as were age differences in ethnic identity status. Traditional students (strongly identified with indigenous culture) demonstrated greater ego strengths than bicultural (identified with both their own and mainstream cultures) adolescents.																			1050-8392						2012	22	2					225	234		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2011.00769.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2011.00769.x													WOS:000304092000004

In mid-adolescence, girls performed nearly one standard deviation below the population mean on academic achievement tests. Low IQ and special education needs were strong correlates of poor academic achievement, but living in a highly educated neighborhood was associated with higher academic achievement scores. By early adulthood, 62.7% of girls had received a General Educational Development (GED) or high school degree, and mid-adolescent academic achievement was the strongest predictor of degree attainment. Results suggest a need for early academic intervention targeting individual and neighborhood factors among offending girls.

Social Networking Site Use Predicts Changes in Young Adults' Psychological Adjustment	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined youths friendships and posted pictures on social networking sites as predictors of changes in their adjustment over time. Observational, self-report, and peer-report data were obtained from a community sample of 89 young adults interviewed at age 21 and again at age 22. Findings were consistent with a leveling effect for online friendships, predicting decreases in internalizing symptoms for youth with lower initial levels of social acceptance, but increases in symptoms for youth with higher initial levels over the following year. Across the entire sample, deviant behavior in posted photos predicted increases in young adults problematic alcohol use over time. The importance of considering the interplay between online and offline social factors for predicting adjustment is discussed.

Structural equation modeling was used to establish measurement models for each of the latent constructs, determine the relationships among the latent constructs, and examine the overall model fit of the data. The relationships among the latent constructs of ED, PAS, and DEP were tested using a mediation model. Results indicate that there is a significant, positive relationship between DEP and PAS and that ED are a partial mediator of this relationship. This study provides evidence for the importance of evaluating how ED can influence the trajectory of depression in the lives of adolescent females.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2011	21	2					335	341		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00687.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00687.x													WOS:000290627300002

Participants were 175 diverse college students who completed indices of ethnic identity exploration and commitment, self-esteem, and domain-general identity resolution. Multilevel modeling analyses indicated that exploration and commitment continued to increase during the college years. Although there were ethnic differences in initial levels of ethnic identity, the rate of change did not vary by ethnicity. Domain-general identity was positively associated with exploration and commitment and mediated the association between self-esteem and commitment. The findings highlight the ongoing development of ethnic identity beyond adolescence and suggest that ethnic identity is part of the larger identity project.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2009	19	4					601	624		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00609.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00609.x													WOS:000271974500002

Problem behavior and heart rate reactivity in adopted adolescents: Longitudinal and concurrent relations	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The present longitudinal study examined resting heart rate and heart rate variability and reactivity to a stressful gambling task in adopted adolescents with aggressive, delinquent, or internalizing behavior problems and adopted adolescents without behavior problems (total N=151). Early-onset delinquent adolescents showed heart rate hyporeactivity to the stress-eliciting gambling task compared to late-onset delinquent adolescents and adolescents without behavior problems. Heart rate, heart rate variability, and reactivity to stress were not related to environmental factors such as early-childhood parental sensitivity, parental socioeconomic status, or adoptee's health status at arrival.

We utilized the National Longitudinal Survey of Canadian Children and Youth (NLSCY) in which heterosexual behaviors, as well as puberty, parenting processes, peer self-concept, and problem behaviors were examined. The heterosexual activities of the majority of 12- and 13-year-old adolescents were largely confined to light activities of hugging, holding hands, and kissing. Heavy activities such as petting and sexual intercourse were reported less often. Using predictor variables from Cycle 1 of the NLSCY when participants were 10- and 11-year-olds, SEM analyses indicated that puberty and higher peer self-concept shared significant direct pathways to both light and heavy heterosexuality. Heavy sexual activity, however, was uniquely associated with the risk factors of adolescent problem behaviors. Positive and hostile parenting styles were indirectly associated with light sexual activity through peer self-concept. Positive and hostile parenting styles were also indirectly associated with heavy sexual activity through both peer-oriented self-concept and problem behaviors. Results support differential patterns and predictors of light and heavy sexuality in early adolescence.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2008	18	1					145	172		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2008.00554.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2008.00554.x													WOS:000253480300007

The study focused specifically on the moderating effect of change in student ethnic congruence from middle to high school. Results indicate that students experiencing more ethnic incongruence from middle to high school, in particular African American and male students, reported declining feelings of school belonging over time. Moreover, students experiencing ethnic incongruence also had increasing worries about their academic success. These results suggest that the changing school demographics from middle school to high school may negatively impact students' school-related affect, especially if they move to high schools which include fewer students who are ethnically similar to themselves.																			1050-8392						2007	17	1					207	220		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2007.00519.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2007.00519.x													WOS:000244603300010

Participants were 157 early adolescent girls (ages 10-13) who completed self-report measures designed to assess girls' level of involvement with boys, pubertal status, and psychological adjustment. Girls' degree of romantic involvement was positively associated with higher depression scores. More advanced pubertal status was associated with both lower body image satisfaction and higher depression scores. A significant interaction between platonic involvement and pubertal status emerged. Girls who were less sexually mature but who also reported more platonic involvement with boys reported greater body image satisfaction. These findings suggest that the type of involvement with boys (romantic vs. platonic) and a girl's pubertal status influence psychological adjustment.

The purpose of the current study was to examine this link in a longitudinal sample of African American youth. The study examined the interrelationships between alcohol and both marijuana use and school motivation over the high school years and their effect on graduation in 681 African American adolescents (50.8% female). School motivation was shown to relate to subsequent alcohol use throughout high school and marijuana use early in high school. School motivation did not affect graduation status, but alcohol and marijuana use were related to a lower likelihood of graduating from high school. Some gender differences and differences among those who had tried alcohol or marijuana at the first wave as opposed to those who had not tried each substance were found. The findings support a systems model where school experiences can affect substance use, which, in turn, can affect the completion of high school.																			1050-8392						2003	13	2					185	210		10.1111/1532-7795.1302003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1532-7795.1302003													WOS:000182900700003

The objective was to understand whether sports involvement positively contributes to mental health independent of the effects of other known protective factors (parental and peer support); and whether it moderates the depressive effects of family, peer, and school-based risk factors. Analyses focused on 1,036 high school-aged youth interviewed at two time points. Regression analysis results indicated a significant association between team sports involvement and depressed mood among both males and females, which was reduced to insignificance after controlling for the other protective factors. One interaction effect was observed: for females, but not males, team sports involvement was shown to protect against depressed mood associated with poor school performance (low grade point average). Thus, the role of sports involvement as a positive instrumental activity for females is discussed.

A total of 128 adolescents were observed in a semistructured interaction with a same-gender friend in Grades 9, 10, and 11. Developmental changes were evident. Intimacy based on discussion and self-disclosure increased between Grades 9 and 10, and the capacity for sustained intimate affect increased between Grades 10 and 11. These developments occurred for both boys and girls. Moreover, the boys and girls did not differ in their sustainment of shared affect in interactions with their friends. However, they did differ in intimate behaviors: The girls were more likely than the boys to establish intimacy through discussion and self-disclosure; the boys were more likely than the girls to establish intimacy through shared activities. The implications of these findings regarding development and differential gender patterns of intimacy ale discussed.																			1050-8392						1999	9	2					143	159		10.1207/s15327795jra0902_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0902_2													WOS:000080224200002

European American adolescents in 9th through 12th grade (N = 215) carried electronic pagers for 1 week and completed self-report forms in response to signals received at random times. Results indicated that AT was related to spending more time with peers and less time with family. Although average overall mood states did not vary as a function of Al, variability of affect and investment across contexts were significantly related to Al. When the experience of specific social contexts was examined, the results indicated that greater Al was related to (a) lower affect, greater negative mood, and feelings of social isolation with family; (b) almost no difference in the experience of time spent with peers; and (c) lower affect when alone. Curvilinear relations between Al and feelings of investment with family and when alone indicate that moderate AT was associated with the experience of greater motivation for activities in these contexts.																			1050-8392						1998	8	4					403	422		10.1207/s15327795jra0804_1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0804_1													WOS:000077473100001
J	Feldman, SS; Gowen, LK; Fisher, L				Feldman, SS; Gowen, LK; Fisher, L			Family relationships and gender as predictors of romantic intimacy in young adults: A longitudinal study	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												In a longitudinal study of the influence of gender and family factors on young adult romantic intimacy, we assessed at Time 1 (T1) family cohesion, flexible family control, respect for privacy and parents' marital satisfaction. Six years later, at Time 2 (T2), intimacy was assessed by 3 self-report measures: happiness in love, problems of insufficient intimacy, and romantic attachment style. Participants (n = 122; 60 men, 62 women) and their families were surveyed twice: T1 when youth were between ages 13 and 18 years, and T2 was 6 years later when they were between ages 19 and 25. Men reported more problems of insufficient intimacy than women, regardless of family dynamics. In regressions and discriminant analyses, flexible control, and to a lesser extent cohesion, predicted young adults' intimacy as did mothers' marital satisfaction. There were also gender-differentiated antecedents to intimacy, with family influences stronger for women than for men. Specifically, family respect for privacy predicted happiness in love for women, but had opposite effects for men, and flexible family control predicted romantic attachment style for women but not for men. Family influences on intimacy were interpreted in terms of their potential to counterbalance traditional gender roles.

J	Melby, JN; Conger, RD				Melby, JN; Conger, RD			Parental behaviors and adolescent academic performance: A longitudinal analysis	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Using data on 347 seventh graders and their parents, this research examines the relation of 2 types of parental behaviors (involved parenting and hostility) to adolescent academic performance. Strengths of the study include the use of four waves of data obtained from multiple informants (including observers of parent-adolescent interaction) and separate analyses for mothers and fathers. Results extend earlier cross-sectional research by demonstrating that parental behavior affects later (Time 4) academic performance controlling for earlier performance (Time 1). That is, these findings go beyond earlier cross-sectional research by showing that parenting practices actually foster change in academic accomplishment across time. For both mothers and fathers, setting and positively reinforcing appropriate behavioral standards (a parental management dimension) increased academic performance, whereas hostility (a dimension of negative emotional affect) decreased academic performance. Parent educational level was related to involvement-but not to hostility-and to academic performance.

A total of 827 students in Grades 7 through 11 completed questionnaires assessing eating problems, sensitivity to social evaluation, and the contents and levels of interaction with their mothers and their peers in regard to eating and dieting. At higher grade levels there was a greater relative impact of peer interactions on the girls' eating problems. The difference between Grades 9 and 10 was most pronounced in that for girls in Grades 10 and 11 peer influence was stronger than maternal influence, whereas maternal influence was stronger than peer influence among girl in Grades 8 and 9.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					1996	6	3					309	324																WOS:A1996UZ37100004

Peer sociometric data were collected for 285 female participants from five schools in 1979, when the girls were in the fourth grade. In 1990, the birth certificates for the county were examined for the period 1980-1990 for 226 girls (79%) who remained in the sample. Analyses indicated significant differences in prevalence of births among peer sociometric status groups; controversial girls were most likely to become adolescent mothers (50%, in contrast to the base rate for the sample of 26%). Fifty percent of aggressive girls in the sample became adolescent mothers, in contrast to 25% of the nonaggressive girls. Controversial girls had more children than girls in other status groups; aggressive girls had more children than nonaggressive girls. Survival and hazard analyses indicated that controversial and aggressive girls gave birth earlier in adolescence than other girls.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					1996	6	2					201	223																WOS:A1996UD67500004

Positioning adolescence in the developmental timeline	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Adolescence, the second decade of life, bridges childhood and adulthood, but also represents a host of unique experiences that impact health and well-being. Lifespan theories often emphasize the continuity of individual characteristics and their contexts from childhood to adolescence, underscoring the distal influence of childhood experiences. Yet, adolescence is marked by transitions that may provoke discontinuities, particularly within individuals, their contexts, and their interactions within those contexts. These discontinuities occur at varied times, orders, and intensities for individual youth, suggesting that adolescence may be a developmental turning point where earlier life experiences may be mediated, reversed, or transformed by proximal events. This perspective piece emphasizes the importance of considering transitions, discontinuities, and developmental turning points in adolescence as well as their potential to explain heterogeneity in adolescent and adult outcomes. We explore one biological and one contextual transition in adolescence and highlight innovative theories and methods for investigating continuity and discontinuity dynamics across development, which could lead to new insights related to the adolescent period and its importance in shaping future life trajectories.

Focusing on one such community, the Kodavas, an Indigenous community in South India, this study aims to understand the shifting configurations of social identity based on the changing sociocultural structure and its implications on identity perception among the adolescents belonging to the Kodava community in Kodagu district in Karnataka, India. This study used a qualitative research design to develop an analytical framework of social identity formation and its transitions in the context of the Kodavas. Data were collected from 188 adolescents (47% boys, 53% girls) between 13 and 17 years (M age = 15 years), in the form of essay writing. The findings based on thematic analysis highlight the core traditional elements of Kodava identity, factors influencing the transition in identity, and its reflection in the contemporary period.

Given that the meaning of family obligation has undergone rapid changes in recent decades, it is crucial to examine the role of family obligation in adolescent adjustment in contemporary China. More importantly, although past research has investigated the consequences of family obligation on adolescents' adjustment, little is known about the antecedents of Chinese adolescents' family obligation. Using a two-wave longitudinal sample of 450 Chinese adolescents (mean age = 13.78 years, SD = .71 years; 49% female) and their parents, the current research explored two questions. First, this study examined the role of family obligation in adolescents' academic achievement, externalizing problems, and internalizing problems over early adolescence. Second, this study explored the role of parents in predicting Chinese adolescents' family obligation, specifically whether parental expectations or parental acceptance was predictive of adolescents' family obligation over time. Third, this study investigated whether family obligation is an underlying mechanism between parenting and Chinese adolescents' adjustment. Results showed that Chinese adolescents' family obligation was longitudinally associated with increased academic achievement and reduced externalizing problems. Moreover, perceived parental acceptance, but not parental expectations, was longitudinally associated with Chinese adolescents' greater family obligation. Notably, family obligation mediated the longitudinal effect of parental acceptance on Chinese adolescents' externalizing problems. By studying both the consequences and antecedents of Chinese adolescents' family obligation, this study helps provide a comprehensive understanding of this cultural strength.

The contribution of community service during the transition to adulthood to health in adulthood	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Prior studies have linked young people's community service to indicators of health, yet little research takes the long view by connecting youth's community service to health in the next decade of life. Using a lifespan developmental lens, this study examined community service over the transition to adulthood and uses change over time in community service to predict indicators of behavioral, physical, and psychological health at ages 35 and 40. Data were taken from Monitoring the Future U.S. national multi-cohort data spanning ages 18-40 in high school cohorts from 1976 to 1995 for age 40 (N = 4300) and 1976 to 2000 for age 35 (N = 5879). Models estimated a growth curve model for community service from ages 18 to 30 and found that the slope for community service was associated with alcohol use, binge drinking, marijuana use, healthy behaviors, and life satisfaction at ages 35 and 40, with cigarette use at age 35 only, and with self-esteem and depressive symptoms at age 40 only. Less decline in community service over the transition to adulthood was associated with lower substance use, more healthy behaviors, and higher psychological well-being in adulthood. This study contributes evidence that community service and health are linked across the lifespan and suggests the value of examining the long-term implications of developmental change across adolescence and the transition to adulthood.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				2024 FEB 20	2024										10.1111/jora.12922	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12922		FEB 2024						38378910					WOS:001166431500001

Linking video chatting, phone calling, text messaging, and social media with peers to adolescent connectedness	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												For 14 days three times per day (6072 observations), adolescents (N = 207, M-age = 15.45 years) reported their digital (i.e., video chatting, texting, social media, and phone calling) communication with peers and their social connectedness. Controlling for in-person interactions, adolescents felt more connected in hours when they had communicated with peers by video chatting, texting, or social media, but not phone calling. Girls communicated with peers via text and social media more than boys, and boys talked on the phone more than girls. Boys who talked, texted, or video chatted more on average reported higher connectedness on average, whereas girls did not. As the links with connectedness were only found at the hourly- and not the daily level, results highlight that a sense of connectedness from digital media may be fleeting in nature.

Qualitative Examination of White Racial Socialization	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Research has examined racial socialization practices within families of color, but less is known regarding what White parents teach their children about race and/or racism. To explore White racial socialization processes, we interviewed 30 White parents of White children ages 7-17 years living in the Midwest. Using thematic analysis, we identified 22 themes organized into four domains: Content of conversations, factors to consider in socialization, developmental differences, and White identity/privilege. A majority of parents reported conversations about current or historic racial events, while relatively few also reported speaking specifically about systemic racism and microaggressions. Parents viewed adolescents as better able to handle difficult topics than children. Findings contribute to theoretical frameworks and may inform the development of educational resources.

This study examines how the AWA and racial identity (RI) influence one another longitudinally during the transition to college for Black students. Findings were moderated by gender. For Black males, a negative feedback loop emerged for RI centrality where AWA experiences predicted lower centrality, which then predicted more AWA experiences over a 2-year period. Additionally, AWA experiences in high school predicted lower RI private regard for Black males and lower RI public regard for Black females during the first year of college. Implications and policy recommendations to address forms of cultural oppression such as the AWA are further discussed.

This review first synthesizes empirical findings on the relationship between obesity and substance use (e.g., alcohol, cannabis, tobacco use). Multidisciplinary theoretical frameworks referencing behavioral medicine, neuroscience, psychology, and public health are then used to inform an interdisciplinary, conceptual model focused on pathways and processes by which obesity increases risk of substance use. Recommendations for future research underscore the importance of prospective studies that encompass multiple domains of development. Recommendations for practice include family-based interventions that promote adaptive self-regulation, targeted antibullying or victimization interventions, and increased attention by health professionals on risky behavior associated with adolescent obesity.

Positive and Negative Online Experiences and Loneliness in Peruvian Adolescents During the COVID-19 Lockdown	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Global COVID-19 lockdowns have disrupted adolescents' in-person social networks, increasing likelihood of loneliness. Social media can help adolescents maintain and develop peer relationships across distance. In this short longitudinal study with 735 Peruvian adolescents (ages: 11-17) from low-to-middle-income urban settings, we investigated whether online experiences relate to loneliness during initial stages of lockdown. Loneliness remained constant between week 6 and 11 of lockdown, was higher for females and similar across school-grades. Positive and negative online experiences were more frequent for older students, and females experienced more negative online experiences than males. Greater positive online experiences related to lower loneliness, with the reverse pattern for negative online experiences. Our results suggest that positive online experiences may mitigate loneliness during physical isolation.

Younger siblings became more similar to their older siblings' risky decision making after observing their older sibling take risks). Younger siblings who reported greater modeling of their older sibling, and less differentiation from them, showed increased neural similarity to their older siblings in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the right anterior insula and ventral striatum, respectively.

Participants included 35 adolescent girls who completed an implicit emotion regulation task during fMRI. Mothers reported on the quality of their adult attachment and emotional awareness when youth were in elementary school. Higher anxious attachment and lower emotional awareness were significantly correlated with more positive amygdala-right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex connectivity, a pattern linked in prior research with ineffective emotion regulation and emotional difficulties. Further, there was an indirect effect of anxious attachment on adolescent connectivity through emotional awareness. These results suggest that compromised maternal emotional resources in childhood may be linked to atypical neural processing of emotions.

We consider these relations longitudinally among a sample of sexually active justice-involved adolescent males (N = 752, M age = 15.58) a group at heightened risk for sexual risk-taking. We found that optimistic expectations for the future predict a higher likelihood of engaging in consistent condom use, whereas high impulse control is related to a lower likelihood of casual sex.

Electroencephalogram data were gathered from 15 young adolescents, 16 old adolescents, and 16 young adults during viewing affective pictures. The results indicated that both positive and negative pictures induced greater intra- and interhemispheric long-distance beta coherences than neutral pictures. However, opposite results were observed between young and old adolescents in terms of negative phase differences. Old adolescents exhibited greater beta coherences for positive and negative pictures than both young adolescents and young adults, but there was no difference between the groups for neutral pictures. These observations suggest that long-range beta coherence might reflect the late maturation of affective functional integration in adolescents.

Four profiles were found: self-focused, anxiety-free, other-focused, and undifferentiated. Results indicated that Self-Focused adolescents were the most aggressive and viewed as leaders by their peers compared to the other groups. Self-Focused and anxiety-free youth reported more delinquency than their peers. Few differences between cultural groups emerged, suggesting that this approach is a promising avenue for understanding heterogeneity in behavior.

This study examined associations of community violence exposure with internalizing symptoms, and state and trait emotion dysregulation as mechanisms underlying these associations, in 287 adolescents aged 16-17 (45.6% male; 40.8% White). Community violence exposure was associated with internalizing symptoms, negative affect during peer evaluation, trait emotional reactivity, and infrequent problem solving. Multiple emotion dysregulation indices were also associated with internalizing symptoms. In simultaneous multiple mediator models, indirect effects of community violence on internalizing problems were significantly explained by state and trait emotion dysregulation. Findings implicate emotion dysregulation as one mechanism linking community violence exposure to adolescent internalizing symptoms.

In this functional magnetic resonance imaging study, 30 late adolescents and 30 young adults made risky and neutral decisions in social scenarios and received valenced outcomes. Negative outcomes in risky decisions eliciting regret, as compared with negative outcomes in neutral decisions eliciting disappointment, activated executive control (orbitofrontal cortex) and self-relevance regions (middle temporal gyrus [MTG], posterior cingulate cortex, and precuneus) for both age groups. Young adults showed more activation than adolescents in regret and disappointment as compared with relief and elation conditions in the avoidance (insula), action monitoring (inferior frontal gyrus, pre-SMA, and caudate), and social-cognition regions (superior temporal sulcus and MTG). These late socio-emotional developments may pave the way for more adaptive decision-making behavior in social contexts.

The core category, paving pathways through the pain, suggests that LGBTQ youth build on emotional pain inflicted by external adversities to carve out pathways to resilience. Youth employed the following resilience processes: (1) navigating safety across contexts, (2) asserting personal agency, (3) seeking and cultivating meaningful relationships, (4) un-silencing marginalized identities, and (5) engaging in collective healing and action. Youth focused on particularly painful adversities and engaged intentionally in one or more of the resilience processes related to the origins of their pain.

Assessing Variations in Developmental Outcomes Among Teenage Offspring of Teen Mothers: Maternal Life Course Correlates	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study investigated potential heterogeneity in development among offspring (age 17) of teen mothers and maternal life course as correlates of variation. Using latent class analysis, subgroups of developmental outcomes were identified. Maternal standing in two life course realms (i.e., socioeconomic and domestic) was considered as a potential explanation for heterogeneity in offspring's development. Offspring reported on measures assessing their psychological, academic, and behavioral development. Teen mothers reported on measures of life course realms. Three subgroups of developmental outcomes were identified: on track (52%), at risk (37%), and troubled (11%). Findings suggest that economic hardship and number of pregnancies among teen mothers distinguish developmental patterns among teenage offspring, whereas teen mothers' educational attainment and marital status do not.

Stress, Coping, and Mood Among Latino Adolescents: A Daily Diary Study	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The current study examines whether daily coping moderates the effects of daily stress on same-day mood and next-day mood among 58 Latino adolescents (M-age=13.31; 53% male). The daily diary design capitalized on repeated measurements, boosting power to detect effects and allowing for a robust understanding of the day-to-day experiences of Latino adolescents. Hierarchical linear modeling revealed that on days when youth reported higher levels of peer and academic stress, they also reported more negative moods. However, only poverty-related stress predicted mood the following day. Engagement coping buffered the effect of poverty-related stress on next-day negative and positive mood, while disengagement exacerbated the effects of academic and peer stress. The need for interventions promoting balanced coping repertoires is discussed.

Parental Social Coaching and Parenting Emotional Climate Predict Adolescent Receptivity	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Associations linking parenting emotional climate and quality of parental social coaching with young adolescents' receptivity to parental social coaching were examined (N = 80). Parenting emotional climate was assessed with adolescent-reported parental warmth and hostility. Quality of parental social coaching (i.e., prosocial advice, benign framing) was assessed via parent-report and behavioral observations during a parent-adolescent discussion about negative peer evaluation. An adolescent receptivity latent variable score was derived from observations of adolescents' behavior during the discussion, change in adolescents' peer response plan following the discussion, and adolescent-reported tendency to seek social advice from the parent. Parenting climate moderated associations between coaching and receptivity: Higher quality coaching was associated with greater receptivity in the context of a more positive climate. Analyses suggested a stronger association between coaching and receptivity among younger compared to older adolescents.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				DEC	2016	26	4					738	752		10.1111/jora.12222	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12222								28453193					WOS:000389759300010

Sibling Facilitation Mediates the Association Between Older and Younger Sibling Alcohol Use in Late Adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Previous research has shown adolescent siblings are similar in their alcohol use and that this similarity is largely due to their shared environment. Using a genetically informed sibling sample (196 full-biological pairs, 384 genetically unrelated pairs), we confirmed that the extent to which older siblings facilitate younger siblings' alcohol use (i.e., help them get alcohol) was one factor contributing to this shared environmental association. All analyses controlled for parent and peer influences. Findings were not moderated by sibling differences in genetic relatedness, gender, or ethnicity. Proximity in sibling age strengthened these associations, somewhat. Results were especially strong for sibling pairs where the older sibling was of legal drinking age.

Physiological responses included respiratory sinus arrhythmia reactivity (RSAR) and skin conductance level reactivity (SCLR) during laboratory-based peer-evaluative stress experiences. Engaged and disengaged coping strategies were assessed with real-time responses to peer-evaluative stress (assessed immediately following peer-evaluative stress experiences in the laboratory) and with questionnaire-based responses to peer victimization.

Digital Peer Interactions Affect Risk Taking in Young Adults	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Digital interactions are an increasingly common communication method among young adults, but little is known about whether such remote exchanges influence riskiness. The current study examined whether observing and interacting with, versus simply observing, a digital peer affect risk taking in young adults aged 18-25. Participants who remotely viewed risky behavior by a peer or computer increased risk taking; however, compared to a control condition, only exposure to risk-encouraging messages from a digital peer resulted in sustained risk-taking behavior. These findings suggest that short text-based messages from a risk-encouraging digital peer can influence risk-taking behavior in young adults. Given the rapid proliferation of digital communication among this age group, these results highlight a potentially important source of peer influence on risky behavior.

An Examination of the Relationship Among High School Size, Social Capital, and Adolescents' Mathematics Achievement	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												In an effort to enhance both adolescents' social capital and increase achievement, public school districts across the United States have created small high schools. Using data derived from a longitudinal and nationally representative study of U.S. high school students, the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002, results show that when adolescents' parents know their friends' parents math achievement is significantly predicted. This association, however, is nonsignificant when conditioned on standard measures of prior achievement and family background, among others. In addition, while this relationship is also strong and significant within small high schools, it, too, is eliminated when conditioned on select confounding variables.

A total of 252 British female adolescents (M age = 12.9 years; SD = .7) in Years 79 completed self-report measures to assess physical activity and physical self-concept. Percentage of predicted adult (mature) stature served as the index of biological maturation. Univariate analyses of covariance, controlling for decimal age, revealed that the least mature girls generally held higher perceptions of physical self-concept but were no more, or less, active than the most mature girls.

Who Is Supporting Homeless Youth? Predictors of Support in Personal Networks	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Homeless youth lack the traditional support networks of their housed peers, which increases their risk for poor health outcomes. Using a multilevel dyadic analytic approach, this study identified characteristics of social contacts, relationships, and social networks associated with the provision of tangible and emotional support to homeless youth (N = 419, M age = 20.09, SD = 2.80). Support providers were likely to be family members, sex partners, or nonstreet-based contacts. The provision of support was also associated with contacts' employment and homelessness status, frequency of contact, shared risk behaviors, and the number of network members that were homeless and employed. The results provide insights into how homeless youth could be assisted to develop more supportive social networks.					de la Haye, Kayla/LNR-3691-2024; Green, Harold/IXX-0651-2023; Kennedy, David/E-7894-2011; Golinelli, Daniela/H-2287-2015	Green, Harold/0000-0003-0740-9178; Golinelli, Daniela/0000-0002-6433-1752													1050-8392						2012	22	4					604	616		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2012.00806.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2012.00806.x								23204810					WOS:000311107000003

J	Gayman, MD; Lloyd, DA; Ueno, K				Gayman, Mathew D.; Lloyd, Donald A.; Ueno, Koji			The History and Timing of Depression Onset as Predictors of Young Adult Self-Esteem	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Depression often emerges early in the lifecourse and is consistently shown to be associated with poor self-esteem. The 3 main objectives of the current study are to (1) evaluate the association between a history major depression and self-esteem in young adulthood, (2) assess the relationship between timing of depression onset and young adult self-esteem, and (3) help rule out the alternative interpretation that the relationship between major depression and self-esteem is due to state dependence bias stemming from recent depressive symptoms and stressful life events. To address these objectives we use data from a 2-wave panel study based on a community sample of young adults in Miami-Dade County, Florida (n = 1,197). Results indicated that a history of major depression during sensitive periods of social development is associated with negative changes in self-esteem over a 2-year period during the transition to young adulthood. Among those with a history of depression, earlier onset was more problematic than later onset for young adult self-esteem, although the difference disappeared once the level of self-esteem 2 years prior was controlled. The linkages between the history and timing of depression onset with self-esteem were observed net of recent depressive symptoms and stressful life events and are thus robust to an alternative interpretation of state dependence. The findings support the argument that major depression, especially if it develops earlier during child-adolescent development, has negative consequences for one's self-esteem.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2011	21	3					691	702		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00702.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00702.x								21860585					WOS:000293790200016

Cut-scores from the Almost Perfect Scale-Revised (APS-R; Slaney, Rice, Mobley, Trippi, & Ashby, 2001) classified adolescents as adaptive perfectionists, maladaptive perfectionists, and nonperfectionist.

Further, peers rated both perfectionism groups as more prosocial and less disruptive than nonperfectionists. Adaptive perfectionists were more liked than maladaptive perfectionists.

Positive Development in a Disorderly World	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Adolescents need to develop competencies to navigate an adult world that is complex and disorderly: a world of heterogeneous macro- to microecological systems containing contradictions and catch-22s. This exploratory essay examines adolescents' conscious processes of developing pertinent competencies for pursuing goals (agency) in these kinds of "real-world" settings. It draws on qualitative longitudinal research on youth's experiences working on arts and community projects in which they encounter the irregular dynamics of complex human systems. I describe how youth develop "strategic thinking": executive skills for formulating strategies based on forecasting dynamics in navigating these systems. I also describe how youth learn to manage emotions (in self and others) that arise in these real-world transactions and how they develop motivation that sustains their work toward goals. Even as we learn more about the biological hardware of development, I argue that we must study youth's conscious, proactive processes in developing their own "software" to navigate complex and disorderly human worlds.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2011	21	2					317	334		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00707.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00707.x													WOS:000290627300001

This review first proposes a framework for considering pubertal timing and maladaptive behavior. Next, the literature on pubertal timing and depression is discussed, followed by the literature on pubertal timing and externalizing behavior with fine distinctions being made for males and females. Additionally, mediating and moderating variables are reviewed in an effort to understand mechanisms by which timing of puberty and maladjustment may operate or risk factors that may amplify the detrimental consequences of the pubertal transition. Finally, conclusions and future directions are proposed.																			1050-8392						2011	21	3					717	746		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00708.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00708.x													WOS:000293790200018

Contributions of Anthropology to the Study of Adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Adolescence researchers can turn to anthropology to learn the methods of ethnography and cultural comparisons, and they can mine its large database of information on cultures worldwide. But anthropology's single most important contribution is the concept of culture, the mosaic of a group's learned and shared, or at least understood, beliefs, practices, and modes of expression.

In support of RAAM, unadjusted odds of exiting at 2 years and stably exiting over 2 years revealed that engagement with prosocial peers, maternal social support, and continued school attendance all promoted exiting behaviors. Simultaneously, exposure to family violence and reliance on shelter services discouraged stably exiting behaviors. Implications for family-based interventions are proposed.

The Longitudinal Interplay of Maternal Warmth and Adolescents' Self-Disclosure in Predicting Maternal Knowledge	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined the longitudinal associations among maternal warmth, adolescents' self-disclosure, and maternal knowledge during the transition to adolescence. Three years of self-report data were collected from 131 married mothers and their adolescents. Results from longitudinal analysis using adolescent reports indicated that greater maternal warmth in sixth grade predicted higher levels of adolescents' self-disclosure in seventh grade, which in turn led to higher levels of maternal knowledge in eighth grade. Thus, adolescents' self-disclosure served as an indirect link between higher maternal warmth and greater knowledge over time. An alternative model with prior self-disclosure predicting subsequent maternal warmth and knowledge was not supported. Overall, this study demonstrated a time-ordered process by which maternal warmth and adolescents' self-disclosure predict maternal knowledge. Understanding such processes that affect parental knowledge may be beneficial for future prevention and intervention efforts during the transition to adolescence.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2009	19	4					654	668		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00615.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00615.x													WOS:000271974500004

We used a sample comprising of 97 boys in grade 8 (M age, 14.22 years) from two schools in a medium-sized Swedish town. This age should be optimal for differentiating early, on-time, and later-maturing boys. Boys responded to self-report questionnaires on their Internet use and pubertal timing. Early, on-time, and late-maturing boys did not differ in terms of most Internet activities. However, early maturers reported downloading and viewing pornography more often than the other boys did (p <.001). The findings build on previous research on the link between pubertal timing and sexual behavior in adolescence. Moreover, they help further understanding of the behavioral implications of boys' pubertal timing.

After accounting for demographics and parental and sibling substance use, witnessing serious violence was associated with greater drunkenness, tobacco use, number of illicit drugs used, and problems with drugs and alcohol. In every analysis, exposure to violence was associated with more drug use, while family cohesion and parental monitoring attenuated risk. Further, family cohesion and parental monitoring exerted a protective-stabilizing effect on number of illicit drugs used and on problems with drugs and alcohol. There were few interactions with age.

The sample is composed primarily of poor, ethnic-minority youth living in impoverished urban neighborhoods. As has been found in community samples, juvenile offenders who describe their parents as authoritative are more psychosocially mature, more academically competent, less prone to internalized distress, and less prone to externalizing problems than their peers, whereas those who describe their parents as neglectful are less mature, less competent, and more troubled. Juvenile offenders who characterize their parents as either authoritarian or indulgent typically score somewhere between the two extremes, although those from authoritarian homes are consistently better functioning than those from indulgent homes. These patterns did not vary as a function of adolescents' ethnicity or gender.

Findings based on 380 Italian adolescents showed that perceived filial self-efficacy was linked directly and indirectly to satisfaction with family life, and that these relations held both concurrently and longitudinally. In particular, the greater adolescents perceived their self-efficacy, the more they reported open communication with their parents, the more accepting they were of their parents' monitoring of their own activities outside the home and the less inclined they were to get into escalative discord over disagreements. Regardless of whether perceived filial self-efficacy was placed in the conceptual structure as a contributor to the quality of family interactions or as a partial product of family functioning, it consistently predicted satisfaction with family life.

Data were gathered from the father, the mother, and two of their adolescent children in 288 families. The social relations model was used to assess perceived justice and trust at the family level and the individual level. Adolescent internalizing and externalizing problem behavior turned out to be best predicted at the family level. Adolescents from families with less just or trustworthy climates showed more of these problem behaviors. Also associations between adolescent problem behavior and individual characteristics of the adolescents were found: adolescents who were generally viewed as less just/trustworthy were reported to have more problems. Our findings suggest that processes at different levels of family functioning (i.e., individual, whole-family) should be taken into account when investigating associations between family characteristics and children's outcomes.					scholte, ron/G-2030-2012	Delsing, Marc/0009-0003-7244-9990													1050-8392	1532-7795					2005	15	2					127	150		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2005.00089.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2005.00089.x													WOS:000228750800001

At baseline, the adolescents ranged from 14 to 17 years, and the incarceration outcome measure spanned ages 15 to 30 years. This study tested whether risk factors concentrated in father-absent households explained the apparent effects of father absence. Results from longitudinal event-history analysis showed that although a sizable portion of the risk that appeared to be due to father absence could actually be attributed to other factors, such as teen motherhood, low parent education, racial inequalities, and poverty, adolescents in father-absent households still faced elevated incarceration risks. The adolescents who faced the highest incarceration risks, however, were those in stepparent families, including father-stepmother families. Coresidential grandparents may help attenuate this risk, although remarriage and residential instability increased it. Social policies to support children should broaden beyond an emphasis on marriage to address the risks faced by adolescents living in stepfamilies as well.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2004	14	3					369	397		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2004.00079.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2004.00079.x													WOS:000223514000005

The study evaluated the methods and styles of coping of inner-city youth and their relation to age, gender, ethnicity, stress levels, and,internalizing and externalizing symptom levels. Three hundred seventy-two-12- to 16-year-old adolescents from inner-city schools (67.0% African American; 24.4% Hispanic; 53.41% males) participated. One hundred forty-nine were also included in a follow-up evaluation of the prospective relation of coping to functioning. A seven-factor model of coping methods was identified and found to be applicable across age groups, genders, and ethnic groups. The model was robust over time. Coping methods were categorized through cluster analysis into five styles. Styles were found to relate somewhat to demographic characteristics and stress levels. Controlling for demographic characteristics and stress levels, coping style related concurrently and prospectively to internalizing and externalizing symptom levels. Except in one instance, age, ethnicity, and gender did not interact with coping in predicting symptoms. Implications for further coping research and risk and intervention design are discussed.

J	Steinberg, L				Steinberg, L			We know some things: Parent-adolescent relationships in retrospect and prospect	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This article examines the most important ideas to have emerged from the last 25 years of research on adolescent development in the family context and suggests some directions for the future. Two major sets of questions organize the review. First, how can we best characterize normative family relationships during adolescence, and, more specifically, is adolescence a time of parent-child conflict? Second, how do variations in parent-child relationships affect the developing adolescent? The answer to the first question depends on what is meant by conflict and, more importantly, from whom one gathers data. There is a need for a new perspective on the family, one that emphasizes the different viewpoints and stakes that parents and adolescents bring to their relationship with each other. Special attention should be paid to studies of the mental health of parents of adolescents. With regard to the second question, it is argued that there is enough evidence to conclude that adolescents benefit from having parents who are authoritative: warm, firm, and accepting of their needs for psychological autonomy. Therefore, it would seem most beneficial to institute a systematic, large-scale, multifaceted, and ongoing public health campaign to educate parents about adolescence, one that draws on the collective resources and expertise of health-care professionals, scientists, governmental agencies, community organizations, schools, religious institutions, and the mass media.

However, the sparse research on youth volunteerism is generally limited by a cross-sectional design that does not elucidate causal relations. This study addresses the questions, "Who participates in volunteer work?" and "What are the effects of youth volunteerism?" A panel study of a representative community sample of both volunteers and nonvolunteers indicates that those adolescents who become involved in volunteer activities have higher educational plans and aspirations, higher grade point averages, higher academic self-esteem, and a higher intrinsic motivation toward school work. But irrespective of these bases of selection, there is evidence that volunteering affects important work-related and social outcomes. Volunteering is found to strengthen intrinsic work values and the anticipated importance of community involvement and to decrease the anticipated importance of career.

This study tested this model using multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS). The participants were 1,510 students (Grades 7-9) in two suburban schools in the Midwest. MDS yielded three dimensions, named positive coping resources, conventional/unconventional (i.e., degree of orientation to adult societal norms), and underweight/overweight. Graphing the dimensions led to clusters of behaviors that largely coincided with Jessor's three domains of problem behaviors, health-enhancing behaviors, and emotional factors. This model may help in designing interventions to decrease health-compromising and increase health-enhancing behaviors in adolescents.																			1050-8392						1996	6	2					139	149																WOS:A1996UD67500001

Self-report measures assessing discussion of sexual topics with parents and friends, perceived approval of sexual behavior, sexual attitudes, and sexual behavior were administered to 267 high-school and college-aged female subjects. As expected, results suggested that the influence of friends and parents varied as a function of the age of the adolescent. The effects of discussion with mother and parental approval on sexual behavior operated indirectly through sexual attitudes, with the effect of discussion with mother being the strongest in the 9th and 10th grade. The indirect influence of friends' approval on sexual behavior via sexual attitudes varied across the three age groups, peaking in 11th-12th grades; the direct effect of friends' approval on sexual behavior peaked in the college sample.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					1995	5	4					469	487		10.1207/s15327795jra0504_5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0504_5													WOS:A1995RV13500005

Keita			Coping with ethnic-racial discrimination: Protective-reactive effects of shift-and-persist coping on internalizing symptoms among Black American adolescents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Ethnic-racial discrimination has pervasive negative effects on Black youth's mental health; therefore, it is crucial to identify factors that provide resilience against discrimination. Two promising factors to help youth cope are ethnic-racial identity (how one feels about their ethnicity/race) and shift-and-persist coping (reappraising and accepting an uncontrollable stressor while remaining optimistic about the future). While there is existing scholarship on ethnic-racial identity among Black youth, this work has not yet assessed the impacts of shift-and-persist in this population. Using a sample of 155 Black youth (ages 13-17), the current study examined the interplay between discrimination, ethnic-racial identity, shift-and-persist coping, and internalizing symptoms. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were positively associated with discrimination and negatively associated with shift-and-persist. Significant interactions between discrimination and shift-and-persist predicting both depressive and anxiety symptoms revealed significant negative associations between shift-and-persist and internalizing symptoms at low and average, but not high discrimination levels. Effects are, thus, protective-reactive; the protective effects of shift-and-persist are not significant for youth facing high levels of discrimination. Ethnic-racial identity, surprisingly, was not significantly associated with either depressive or anxiety symptoms, nor did it interact with shift-and-persist as it has in studies of Latinx youth. By understanding the protective benefits of shift-and-persist and ethnic-racial identity in Black youth, during a pivotal period for mental health, we can provide this growing population with tools to lessen the maladaptive outcomes associated with discrimination.

Focusing on a large metropolitan city in Western India, we surveyed 158 street-involved children and adolescents (110 boys and 48 girls, age range from 5 to 17 years) in a group setting along with follow-up group interviews. Despite finding a high prevalence rate of inhalant abuse, our work suggests an absence of supporting structures and emphasizes the need to revisit our understanding and interpretation of substance-using behavior of street-involved youth. Instead of explaining inhalant-abusing behavior as emerging from pathological deficiencies in individuals or households, we stress the need to critically examine the exploitative environment they are embedded in. In doing so, we join efforts to decolonize conventional ways of understanding "deviant" behavior.

Measuring institutional and structural racism in research on adolescence and developmental science	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Dismantling racism and oppression in adolescence requires sound measurement and rigorous methods. In this commentary, we discuss the measurement of institutional and structural racism and approaches to operationalizing structures and systems in adolescent research. Drawing on a recent framework for the conceptualization, measurement, and analysis of institutional racism and health (Needham et al., Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities, in press), we highlight several considerations for measuring institutional and structural racism. These include definitional issues, the tension between individual- and area-level measures, questions of timing, and matters of design and analysis. We conclude with suggestions to address gaps in existing literature and call for transdisciplinary training, collaboration, and partnership to promote the healthy development of Black and Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC) adolescents and young people.

J	Crosnoe, R				Crosnoe, Robert			Contextualizing the Social and Educational Journeys of Adolescents within the Life Course	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												What happens during adolescence emerges from early in life and sets the stage for later in life. This linking function of adolescence within the life course is grounded in social, psychological, and biological development and is fundamental to the intergenerational transmission of societal inequalities. This article explores this life course phenomenon by focusing on how the social ups and downs of secondary school shape adolescents' educational trajectories, translating their backgrounds into their futures through the interplay of their personal agency with the constraints imposed by the stratified institutions they navigate. Illustrative examples include gender differences in risky behavior, racialized experiences of school discipline, immigrant youths' family relations, LGBTQ students' school safety, STEM education, adverse childhood experiences, and mindset interventions.

Based on longitudinal data provided by 843 adolescents (57.3% female) of the German Family Panel (pairfam), we investigated effects of extraversion on changes in loneliness and depressiveness between 2018 and 2019 and the first German COVID-19 lockdown in the first half of 2020. Findings of latent change modeling show that highly extraverted adolescents experienced a larger rise in depressiveness, and a third of this total effect was mediated through increases in loneliness. These results contradict previous work evidencing lower depressiveness among extraverted youth and challenge the notion of extraversion as a mere protective factor. Under conditions of restricted access to others, this personality trait may become a burden.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				SEP	2021	31	3			SI		678	691		10.1111/jora.12648	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12648								34448311					WOS:000690772700014

However, little is known regarding how sleep disturbances are associated with social processes during adolescence, a period when both sleep neurobiology and social relationships are undergoing dramatic developmental changes. The current study examined associations among sleep disturbances and peer connectedness in a sample of middle-school students (N = 213, 11-15 years old, 57% female) using a social network approach. Findings suggested that youth with greater sleep disturbances reported having fewer social connections, were rated as a social connection by fewer peers, and were less likely to have reciprocated nominations, even after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and mental health symptoms.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2022	32	2			SI		756	768		10.1111/jora.12670	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12670		AUG 2021						34338382					WOS:000680036100001

This situation is even more pronounced among runaway youths from residential care centers, given their personal and familial backgrounds that place them at risk. The current study attempted to disentangle the heterogeneous characteristics of runaway youths while considering the adolescent risk-taking literature. A latent profile analysis was performed among 112 runaway youths from residential care centers based on runaway characteristics (number, duration, context of return). The Parent involvement, Independent and Police involvement runaway youth profiles were compared on various characteristics involved in risk-taking, their high-risk behaviors and mental health problems. The clinical implications for these three runaway profiles are discussed.

The research literature has primarily considered external and contextual factors that might explain these rises in symptomatology. In the present study, we investigate relations of pubertal status and timing with individual cognitive, emotional, and behavioral tendencies, commonly identified as transdiagnostic processes, in a sample of N = 228 girls (M-age = 11.75 years). We also test whether these transdiagnostic processes mediate associations of pubertal status and pubertal timing with depressive symptoms. Results support greater endorsement of rumination, co-rumination, negative urgency, and both anxious and angry rejection sensitivity in girls with more advanced pubertal status, as well as in girls with early pubertal timing. Higher levels of transdiagnostic processes fully mediated associations of pubertal status and timing with depressive symptoms at significant and marginally significant levels, respectively. Although the data are cross-sectional, these findings offer promising preliminary evidence that transdiagnostic processes represent an important mental health risk in early adolescent girls.

Evidence of Diverse Identities in a Large National Sample of Sexual and Gender Minority Adolescents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Adolescence is a time of identity exploration, and preliminary evidence indicates the ways adolescents are describing their sexual and gender identities (SOGI) are changing. A nuanced understanding of SOGI is necessary for valid assessment in developmental research. Current measures do not capture the diversity of emerging identities among young people. Our study analyzed a national sample of 17,112 sexual and gender minority adolescents (13-17 years) to better understand how identity labels are reported across sexual, gender, and ethnoracial minorities. Adolescents reported 26 distinct SOGI categories; 24% of adolescents utilized nontraditional SOGI labels, such as pansexual and nonbinary. These identifications varied significantly as a function of ethnoracial identity. Results have implications for how scholars conceptualize and measure SOGI among adolescents.

Perceived parenting styles were measured in Grade 7 (n = 749) and Grade 12 (n = 468), and values were measured in Grade 12 (n = 271) and one year postschool (n = 291). We measured three aspects of valuing: priority (extrinsic, intrinsic importance); regulation (controlled, autonomous); and successful enactment of values (success). Mothers' authoritative parenting in Grade 7 predicted increased importance and autonomous regulation of values one year postschool. Fathers' authoritative parenting in Grade 7 predicted decreased importance of extrinsic values. Fathers' permissive parenting in Grade 7 predicted decreased importance of intrinsic values. Authoritarian parenting in Grade 12 predicted more controlled values regulation postschool, particularly for extrinsic values.

Two ecological momentary assessment studies-with 120 older adolescents (aged 18-19) and 395 younger adolescents (aged 10-16)-captured nightly self-reported and wearable (Jawbone) recorded sleep duration. Self-reported and wearable recorded daily sleep duration were moderately correlated (r similar to .50), associations which were stronger on weekdays and among young adolescent boys. Older adolescents self-reported sleep duration closely corresponded with estimates from the wearable device, but younger adolescents reported having an hour more of sleep, on average, compared to device estimates. Self-reported, but not wearable-recorded, sleep duration and quality were consistently associated with daily well-being measures.

The goal of this study was to (1) adapt the LEDS for use with this population, and (2) examine the reliability (interrater) and validity (concurrent and predictive) of this adaptation among a sample of vulnerable adolescents (N=545). Good reliability coefficients (.79-.90) were obtained, and stressor exposure was associated with concurrent criteria indexing mental health outcomes (depression) and major risk factors for dropout (administratively recorded and self-reported). Also, LEDS scores predicted dropout beyond these risk factors. The adapted LEDS appears useful for describing academically struggling adolescents' stressor exposure.

Connecting Parental Control and Autonomy Support to Adolescent Delinquency	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study investigates short-term and long-term associations between parenting in early adolescence and delinquency throughout adolescence using data from the National Longitudinal Surveys. Multilevel longitudinal Poisson regressions show that behavioral control, psychological control, and decision-making autonomy in early adolescence (ages 10-11) are associated with delinquency trajectories throughout adolescence (ages 10-17). Path analyses reveal support for three mediation hypotheses. Parental monitoring (behavioral control) is negatively associated with delinquency in the short term and operates partly through changes in self-control. Parental pressure (psychological control) shows immediate and long-lasting associations with delinquency through changes in self-control and delinquent peer pressures. Decision-making autonomy is negatively associated with delinquency in the long term, yet may exacerbate delinquency in early adolescence by increasing exposure to delinquent peers.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2017	27	2					452	470		10.1111/jora.12283	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12283								28876516					WOS:000401163500013

This phenomenon is examined on a longitudinal sample using dynamic network analysis (585 students across 16 classes in five schools). As hypothesized, individuals dislike those who they look down on (disdain), and conform to others by disliking those who they perceive as being looked down on by their peers (conformity). The inconsistency between status perceptions also leads to disliking, when individuals do not look up to those who they perceive to be admired by peers (frustration). Adolescents are not more likely to dislike those who they look up to (admiration). The results demonstrate the role of status perceptions on disliking tie formation.

Trajectories of Substance Use: Onset and Adverse Outcomes Among North American Indigenous Adolescents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												North American Indigenous communities experience disproportionately high rates of substance use, abuse, and dependence and their accompanying consequences. This study uses group-based trajectory modeling of past-year substance use (alcohol, marijuana, and cigarettes) with a longitudinal sample of Indigenous adolescents from the northern Midwest and Canada (spanning ages 10-18 years). The early-onset trajectory (36.3%) had more adverse psychosocial difficulties at baseline than the mid-onset group (38.3%); both trajectories were associated with several negative outcomes at the end of the study. The late-onset trajectory (25.3%) did not initiate substance use until later adolescence and had far better outcomes at the last wave of the study. Timing of onset matters.

Letting Oneself Go Isn't Enough: Cognitively Oriented Expressive Writing Reduces Preadolescent Peer Problems	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Peer problems are a stressor for many early adolescents, and simple cost-effective tools for managing peer stress are needed. Expressive writing (EW) may be one such tool. With a sample of middle school children aged 12-14 years (n = 119; 53% males), this research evaluates whether cognitively oriented expressive writing (CEW), which focuses more on psychological self-distancing, improves personal well-being better than traditional EW, which focuses more on emotional disclosure. CEW-compared with EW-slightly enhanced long-term social adjustment for the entire sample, and increased positive affect for those early adolescents that reported more peer problems at baseline.

Adolescent Personality as Risk and Resiliency in the Testosterone-Externalizing Association	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Previous investigations of testosterone and externalizing behavior have provided mixed findings. We tested the hypothesis that self-regulatory personality moderates the testosterone-externalizing behavior association in adolescence. Parents reported on their 13- to 18-year-old (N = 106, M-age = 16.01, SD = 1.29) children's personalities and psychopathology. Testosterone was measured via drool samples. As hypothesized, personality moderated the testosterone-externalizing behavior association. High testosterone predicted higher levels of externalizing behaviors, but only for adolescents low in Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Also, personality acted as a resiliency factor: high levels of Conscientiousness, in the presence of high testosterone, predicted lower levels of rule breaking. Results highlight how endogenous factors, such as personality, may interact with testosterone, and emphasize the relevance of including personality moderators in future research.

Adolescent Pregnancy's Intergenerational Effects: Does an Adolescent Mother's Education Have Consequences for Her Children's Achievement?	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Although substantial work has examined the influence of adolescent pregnancy on mothers' developmental outcomes, few studies have investigated the influence of adolescent mothers' educational attainment on their children's achievement. This article examined the reading and math achievement trajectories of children born to adolescent and nonadolescent mothers with various levels of educational attainment. Results demonstrate that higher levels of maternal education predicted children's higher initial achievement at kindergarten and growth in achievement through eighth grade. The achievement of children with adolescent mothers, however, never reaches parity with the achievement of their peers with nonadolescent mothers. Race also predicted achievement differences. Black and Latino children of adolescent mothers were at greater risk for underachievement.

With family relationships and demographic background controlled, greater adolescent disclosure and less secrecy about activities, but also more maternal control and solicitation, were associated with greater maternal knowledge. Greater dispositional secrecy was associated with greater norm-breaking and generalized anxiety, but parental control and parental solicitation were not. In addition, both gender and maternal control moderated the effects of disclosure on norm-breaking. Differences between these findings and research with Western samples are discussed.

The study included 100 adolescent-parent dyads who were immigrants to the United States from El Salvador and India. While findings pointed to cross-cultural commonalities, such as autonomy seeking among adolescents, they also highlighted the importance of culture to different meanings of autonomy and the limits of the discrepancy thesis. The discussion calls for future scholarship to include concepts of salience to diverse groups such as family interdependence and appreciation for the parental immigrant experience.

Interpersonal Perceptions of Narcissism in an At-Risk Adolescent Sample: A Social Relations Analysis	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study utilized Kenny's social relations model (SRM) to explore the interpersonal correlates of narcissism in an adolescent sample from a voluntary residential program. Participants were forty-seven 16-18-year-olds (24 males, 23 females) attending a 22-week residential program. Participants completed a self-report measure of narcissism and rated one another on narcissism-related traits and social status variables. Individuals with high levels of self-reported narcissism were perceived by peers as antagonistic and likely to engage in future delinquency. Self-reported narcissism was also associated with peer perceptions of narcissism-related traits. Therefore, adolescent narcissism seems to be detected by peers and is associated with peer perceptions of some negative qualities. Potential implications of these findings are discussed.

The Role of Sociopolitical Attitudes and Civic Education in the Civic Engagement of Black Youth	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Civic engagement is important for individual and community well-being. In the current study, we use survey data from a nationally representative sample to examine how sociopolitical attitudes, such as political cynicism, perceptions of institutional discrimination, and political efficacy, along with civic education relate to civic engagement among 593 Black youth, ages 15-25. We found perceived institutional discrimination, political efficacy, and civic education were associated with civic engagement, while political cynicism was not. There is evidence to suggest civic education may strengthen the association between perceived institutional discrimination and civic engagement. The present findings contribute to our understanding of how acknowledging systemic inequity promotes civic engagement among Black youth. Findings are discussed in terms of study limitations and future research directions.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				SEP	2014	24	3			SI		460	470		10.1111/jora.12117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12117													WOS:000344789300005

Low temperance, perspective, and responsibility predicted being a low-level gang member, whereas only lower temperance predicted being a gang leader. Low self-esteem predicted gang membership (low-level and high-level) at a younger age (i.e., during adolescence). However, higher self-esteem and grandiose-manipulative traits predicted being a gang leader during young adulthood. Over time, low-level members became more psychopathic and less psychosocially mature. Gang leaders also became more psychopathic and undercontrolled (as indicated by lower temperance); however, their perspective and responsibility aspects of psychosocial maturity were not affected.

Introduction: For Better or Worse: Intimate Relationships as Sources of Risk or Resilience for Girls' Delinquency	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The recent rise in arrest rates for violent offenses among girls has sparked an increased interest in understanding the risk and protective factors associated with girls' aggression. Particular attention has been drawn to the role that girls' intimate relationships may play in promoting persistence or desistence from delinquency. To this end, a number of independent laboratories have been engaged in conducting prospective longitudinal studies to uncover the influence of romantic relationships on girls' antisocial behavior through the transition from adolescence to emerging adulthood, which are gathered together in this special section. This article introduces the contributions to the special section and considers both the lessons provided and the directions needed for future research devoted to understanding girls' delinquency and aggression.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				MAR	2014	24	1			SI		1	11		10.1111/jora.12076	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12076													WOS:000331528500001

This study assessed the impact of exposure to interparental violence (IPV) on girls' perpetration of violence within romantic relationships and examined whether this relationship was mediated through sensitivity to interpersonal rejection (RS). Exposure to maternal IPV predicted girls' romantic partner aggression in adolescence and 5years later in young adulthood. Additionally, girls high on RS were at increased risk of aggression in romantic relationships in adolescence and young adulthood. RS mediated the relationship between IPV and levels of romantic partner aggression in adolescence, but not into young adulthood. These effects remained stable even when paternal IPV and other forms of parental abuse were controlled.

In adolescence, this was investigated almost exclusively regarding nightmares. This longitudinal study examines developmental trajectories of various adolescent-reported dream patterns, and their associations with parent-reported psychopathology (internalization and externalization problems) in early adolescence. Ninety-four 10- to 11-year-old normally developing children completed a week of sleep, dreaming, and pubertal development assessments. Parents reported behavior problems. Assessments were repeated after 1 and 2years. Reports of unusual dreams decreased over time, and dream recall decreased among girls. Internalizing symptoms longitudinally predicted an increase in dream recall and unusual dreams. Moreover, unusual dreams longitudinally predicted increased behavior problems (internalization and externalization). Assessing dream patterns during early adolescence may help early detection of covert psychopathological distress.

Analyses revealed that within-person increases in depression and violent perpetration decreased the odds of expecting to survive. Individuals who rated themselves in good health and received routine physical care had greater survival expectations. Consistent with documented health disparities, Black and Hispanic youth had lower survival expectations than did their White peers. Neighborhood poverty was linked to diminished survival expectations both within and between persons, with the between-person association remaining significant controlling for mental and physical health, exposure to violence, own violence, and a wide range of sociodemographic factors.

Longitudinal data on friendship networks and happiness of 426 adolescents (M=15.78, SD=0.65) were analyzed, using stochastic actor-based models. Although happiness similarity did not predict friendship formation (selection), happiness dissimilarity predicted friendship dissolution (deselection). In addition, adolescents influenced each other's happiness over time (influence). Our findings indicated that happiness influence can involve either increases or decreases in adolescent happiness, depending on the average level of happiness of their friends. The results highlighted that, in order to understand the development of adolescents' happiness, it is important to examine the happiness of their friends.

Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study demonstrates the importance of taking peers into account in understanding the etiology of running away. The findings suggest that peer deviance is strongly associated with adolescents decision to run away, independent of social network characteristics and their own deviant and conventional behavior, parental attachment, and school bonding. However, the causal process that links peer characteristics and running away remains unclear.

Youth-led participatory research (YPAR), an approach in which young people research and advocate for change on problems of concern to them, could increase students' autonomy in secondary schools. This qualitative study of YPAR examined whether and how the intervention meaningfully affected the interactions and roles of students and adults in two distinctive urban high school settings, identifying concepts for further empirical investigation. Results suggested that YPAR enabled processes of student professionalization that led to novel student-adult collegial interactions, expansion of domains of student influence, and diversification of students with opportunities to influence policies and practices across these two schools.

Participants included 3,041 Dutch youth (M age =12 years, 49% female) from 120 classrooms in 14 schools. Three waves with 3-month intervals of friendship nomination data and self-reports of drinking behavior were collected. Results revealed that within classrooms, friendship nominations tended to be reciprocated and dyadic friendships tended to be embedded within cohesive subgroups (e.g., cliques). Students tended to nominate friends who were the same sex, from a similar ethnic background, and who they previously knew from primary school. Selection processes turned out to play a more significant role than social influence processes in predicting similarity between early adolescent friends' alcohol use. Although friendship dynamics and individual drinking trajectories substantially differed between classrooms, the effects of homophilic selection and social influence did not.

Developmental Precursors of Number of Sexual Partners From Ages 16 to 22	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examines family and child characteristics, parent and peer relationships, and early adolescent behavior as statistical predictors of trajectories of number of sexual partners from midadolescence through early adulthood using data from 527 participants in the Child Development Project. Early adolescent developmental antecedents accounted for modest variance in number of sexual partners. Latent growth models revealed that African American race, more advanced pubertal development, lower parental monitoring knowledge, association with more deviant peers, and lower grade point average in early adolescence each predicted having more sexual partners at age 16. In addition, non-African American race, lower child IQ, higher parental monitoring knowledge, and lower early adolescent internalizing problems each was associated with a higher rate of growth in number of sexual partners over time at the ages following 16.

However, little is known about the direct relationship between birth complications and externalizing behavior. Furthermore, the mechanism by which the birth complications predispose to externalizing behavior is not well explored. This study aims to assess whether birth complications predispose to early adolescent externalizing behavior and to test whether Intelligence Quotient (IQ) mediates relationships between predictor and outcome variables. We used data from a prospective, longitudinal birth cohort of 1,795 3-year-old boys and girls from Mauritius to test hypotheses. Birth complications were assessed from hospital record data, malnutrition from a pediatric exam at age 3 years, psychosocial adversity from parental interviews at age 3 years, and externalizing behavior problems from parental ratings at age 11 years. We found that babies with birth complications are more likely to develop externalizing behavior problems at age 11. Low IQ was associated with birth complications and was found to mediate the link between early predictors and later externalizing behavior. These prospective, longitudinal findings have potential clinical implications for the identification of early adolescent externalizing behavior and for public health attempts to prevent the occurrence of child externalizing behavior problems.

Beyond Exposure: A Person-Oriented Approach to Adolescent Media Diets	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Research on adolescents' use of sexual media has been dominated by a variable-oriented perspective, focusing on incremental effects of media exposure on sexual behavior. The present investigation examines the ways in which adolescents select and organize their television viewing. This study used cluster analysis to identify, validate, and describe distinct profiles of adolescent television use. Eight discrete clusters emerged, each with a unique profile of primetime viewing. To validate the cluster solution, participants' television viewing profiles were compared with their music preferences. The study then examined the sexual content consumed by adolescents in different viewing clusters. Content analysis of the most popular programs revealed that participants in all clusters were watching programs that were high in sexual content alongside programs that were low in sexual content. None of the clusters demonstrated an exclusive preference for sexual content.

J	Daddis, C				Daddis, Christopher			Influence of close friends on the boundaries of adolescent personal authority	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Perceptions of close friends' influence on the construction of boundaries between legitimate parental and personal authority were assessed using a semistructured interview with 183 early (M=11.82 years) and middle (M=15.72 years) adolescents. Participants described sources relevant to the construction of authority beliefs, processes of friend influence, and justifications for influence and noninfluence. Personal, conventional, prudential, and multifaceted issues were assessed. Friends were most salient sources in the construction of boundaries about personal and multifaceted issues and were more salient for middle than for early adolescents. Parental influence was most significant over conventional and prudential issues. Friend influence was primarily attributed to indirect processes, as adolescents used friends as metrics demonstrating age-appropriate levels of freedom. Adolescents endorsed moral reasoning when they justified monitoring friends' jurisdictional bounds.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2008	18	1					75	98		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2008.00551.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2008.00551.x													WOS:000253480300004

Similarity and complementarity of behavioral profiles of friendship types and types of friends:: Friendships and psychosocial adjustment	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study investigated different types of friendships and the behavioral profiles of different types of friends in relation to individual adjustment. In 102 classes with preadolescents (mean age 11), 737 independent friendship dyads, and in 149 classes with adolescents (mean age 14), 1,102 friendship dyads were identified. At each age group, cluster analyses on the behavioral profiles of the dyads yielded three friendship types, with two types of friends within each friendship type: Socially Withdrawn friendship (Victimized Withdrawn and Prosocial Withdrawn friends), Prosocial friendship (High Prosocial and Less Prosocial friends), and Antisocial friendship (Bullying Antisocial and Antisocial friends). The behavioral profiles of the two friends in Prosocial friendships were marked by similarity and in the other two types by complementarity. Both Victimized Withdrawn and Bullying Antisocial friends were less adjusted than participants without friends while Prosocial friends were more adjusted.					scholte, ron/G-2030-2012; Haselager, Gerbert/JFS-0422-2023; Guroglu, Berna/AAL-4664-2021; Haselager, Gerbert/E-3351-2012	Haselager, Gerbert/0000-0001-8508-1185													1050-8392	1532-7795					2007	17	2					357	385		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2007.00526.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2007.00526.x													WOS:000246842900005
J	Hussong, AM				Hussong, AM			Perceived peer context and adolescent adjustment	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examines the relation between close, dyadic, peer relationships and adolescent adjustment by addressing 3 questions. First, which more strongly predicts adolescent adjustment, the quality or the quantity of close friendships? Second, what are the relative contributions of positive and negative friendship qualities to adolescent boys' and girls' adjustment? Third, how do differing patterns of these friendship qualities predict adolescent adjustment? Participants were 456 juniors and seniors attending 2 midwestern high schools (51% boys; ages 16 to 19, M = 17.2, SD = 0.74) who completed a survey assessing adjustment (i.e., adolescent depression, substance use, positive affect) and the qualities of their closest peer relationships. Results partially supported the hypothesized relations between specific friendship qualities and adolescent adjustment, but the pattern of gender differences was opposite to that predicted. However, negative and positive friendship qualities were jointly associated with all indicators of adjustment. Suggestions are offered for further research concerning the relation between peer contexts and adjustment in adolescence.																			1050-8392						2000	10	4					391	415		10.1207/SJRA1004_02	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/SJRA1004_02													WOS:000168026200001

First-order latent variables representing contraceptive use, alcohol use, drug use, aggression, delinquency, diet, exercise, seatbelt use, and dental hygiene were established, using multiple observed measures for each latent variable. Relations among these first-order latent constructs of contraception, problem behaviors, and health behaviors were examined using second-order confirmatory factor analysis. Three alternative models were compared: a second-order factor of problem behavior alone accounting for variation in contraceptive use; a second-order factor of health-protective behavior alone accounting for variation in contraceptive use; and second-order latent variables of both problem behavior and health-protective behavior accounting for variation in contraceptive use. Models including a path between health protection and contraception provided the best fit for the data. The findings demonstrate substantial organization among adolescent health and problem behaviors and suggest that contraceptive behavior should be conceptualized within broader domains of behavior.

The majority of these studies have been exploratory in nature and have supported Kaufman's (1979) finding of a three-factor solution. The few confirmatory factor analytic studies have provided some support for the three-factor interpretation over the two- and one-factor interpretations, but they have consistently failed to examine other potentially valuable models for the WISC-R. This study tested one, two-, three-, and four-factor models within both normal and psychiatric adolescent inpatient samples. For both samples, the Kaufman three-factor solution emerged with the best overall fit of the WISC-R subtest covariance structure. The remaining models (Guilford-Bannatyne, Bannatyne, Guilford, Horn, and single g) were found to be less applicable to the WISC-R subtest covariance structure and were effectively eliminated as explanatory models when applied to the WISC-R.

Subjects were 890 inner-city boys who were enrolled in the fourth and seventh grades of public schools. The boys were followed up with six assessments over the course of 3 years. Based on earlier research, three developmental pathways toward serious disruptive behavior were considered: an overt pathway, a covert pathway, and an authority conflict pathway. The pathways had been formulated on the basis of the sequence of onset of different manifestations of disruptive child behavior as reported by the child and/or his parent. Three forms of internalizing behaviors were the focus of the study: stable depressed mood, stable anxiety, and stable withdrawal. Boys with stable internalizing problems were defined as those who scored high on such a problem during 2 of the 3 years of the study. Results demonstrated that internalizing problems were more associated with a diagnosis of Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder than with a diagnosis of Conduct Disorder. In early adolescence, stable depressed mood occurred more often when boys advanced in either the overt or the covert pathways or when they were involved in multiple, rather than single, pathways. In late adolescence, stable anxiety and stable withdrawal were more common in multiple than in the single pathways. The importance of the interaction between internalizing and disruptive child behaviors is stressed.																			1050-8392						1994	4	4					615	637		10.1207/s15327795jra0404_11	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0404_11													WOS:A1994QL36700011
J	Chiang, SC				Chiang, Shou-Chun			Daily association between parent-adolescent emotion contagion: The role of parent-adolescent connectednesss	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Emotion contagion between parents and adolescents is crucial for understanding adolescents' emotional experiences. However, little is known about how emotion contagion unfolds in daily life and the unique contributions of parent-adolescent relationships. This study examines the associations between parent and adolescent positive and negative emotions, and the moderating role of daily parent-adolescent connectedness. Participants were 191 Taiwanese adolescents (Mage = 12.93; SDage = 0.75; 53% female) and their parents who completed 10-day diary reports of emotions and parent-adolescent connectedness. Results indicate that higher daily parent negative emotions were associated with more adolescent negative emotions, and higher average parent negative emotions were associated with greater average negative emotions and fewer positive emotions in adolescents. Similar bidirectional effects were also found in adolescent-to-parent emotion contagion. Moreover, on days when connectedness was high, parent negative emotions were not associated with adolescent negative emotions but were related to increased positive emotions. Parent positive emotions were related to more positive emotions and fewer negative emotions when connectedness was low. The findings provide important insights into daily parent-adolescent emotion contagion and highlight parent-adolescent connectedness as a modifying factor in shaping dyadic emotional processes.

Overparenting and psychological wellbeing among Chinese adolescents: Findings based on latent growth modeling	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Although overparenting is a growing phenomenon across the globe, there is a severe lack of longitudinal studies examining the trajectory of overparenting and its effects on early adolescent development, particularly in non-Western contexts. The study collected three waves of longitudinal data from 1328 early Chinese adolescents in Hong Kong with an interval of 1 year to examine the stability and change of perceived paternal and maternal overparenting and their effects on adolescent psychological wellbeing. The results indicated that perceived paternal and maternal overparenting declined over time. Besides, adolescents reported lower anxiety and depressive symptoms when they perceived a steep decline in maternal overparenting. Adolescent anxiety at earlier time points also predicted a steeper decline in paternal and maternal overparenting trajectories respectively. Furthermore, we identified gender differences in the initial level of paternal overparenting and the trajectory of maternal overparenting, as well as the effects of rates of change of maternal overparenting on adolescent anxiety and depressive symptoms. The findings give support for self-determination theory and the separation-individuation model, suggesting that changes of overparenting may hinder adolescents' desires for autonomy and self-direction, which may increase their psychological morbidity. The study contributes to theoretical development of contemporary Chinese socialization models and provides useful pointers for future studies of overparenting.

Influence of perceived peer behavior on engagement in self-damaging behaviors during the transition to university	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												As students transition to university, they experience significant social changes that can affect their behaviors, including self-damaging behaviors like disordered eating, problematic alcohol/drug use, suicidal thoughts, and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). Building on prior work, we examined the associations between (1) perceptions of peers' engagement in self-damaging behaviors predicting one's own subsequent engagement in such behaviors (i.e., socialization) and (2) one's own engagement in self-damaging behaviors predicting perceptions of peers' subsequent engagement in such behaviors (i.e., selection). We also examined whether these associations were moderated by the source of influence (close peer/acquaintance) and degree of social disconnection experienced by the student. First-year university students (N = 704) were asked to complete seven monthly surveys. Multilevel models indicated that when students perceived their close peers had engaged in NSSI or suicidal thinking, they had seven times greater odds of future engagement in the same behavior, implying that socialization increases the risk of these behaviors among university students. Perception of acquaintances' NSSI also predicted greater odds of a student's own NSSI the following month. Social disconnection increased the likelihood of matching own behaviors to perceptions of acquaintances' alcohol abuse, highlighting the importance of fostering connections/mentors to reduce self-damaging behaviors on college campuses. Furthermore, when students engaged in alcohol abuse, they had almost four times greater odds of reporting that their acquaintances abused alcohol the following month, emphasizing the importance of the wider social network in alcohol use behaviors.

Stress of being outed to parents, LGBTQ family support, and depressive symptoms among sexual and gender diverse youth	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Limited scholarship has explored how a lack of agency in identity disclosure (being "outed") to parents is associated with mental health experiences of sexual and gender diverse youth (SGDY). With a national sample of SGDY (N = 9272; 66.8% White non-Hispanic) aged 13-17 (M-age = 15.63, SD = 1.24), this study first compared social position differences between SGDY who were outed to their parents compared to those not outed, and second, investigated how the stress from being outed to parents was associated with LGBTQ family support and depressive symptoms. Results revealed that SGDY who were outed to their parents reported higher levels of depressive symptoms and lower amounts of LGBTQ family support than SGDY who were not outed to their parents. In addition, greater stress from being outed to parents was indirectly associated with higher depressive symptoms through lower LGBTQ family support. These relationships significantly varied across gender identity. Findings highlight the importance of instilling greater agency in disclosure experiences among SGDY.

Gender differences in Russian adolescent mental health from 1999 to 2021	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined secular trends in Russian adolescent mental health, the specific effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and associations with country-level indicators. A cross-sectional survey of 12,882 adolescents aged 11-18 years was carried out between 1999 and 2021 using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. The results showed an incline in girls' internalizing problems with a two-fold increase in the gender gap. There was a decline in girls' prosocial behavior and an incline in peer problems, with decreasing gender differences. Conduct problems showed a reversal of gender differences. Changes during the pandemic were not greater than over-time changes, with the exception of inclines in hyperactivity-inattention in both genders. Time trends in adolescent mental health were associated with over-time changes in national indicators of wealth and gender equality. The findings provide a strong basis for further research into the determinants of gender differences in adolescent mental health and for gender-specific interventions.

Three waves of data were collected at 4-5-month time intervals among 3680 Finnish adolescents (M-age = 13.94, 53.0% girls). Cross-lagged panel analyses showed that defending positively predicted popularity and, to a larger degree, being liked over time. No moderating effect of empathy was found. Popularity was more strongly predictive of defending, and defending was more strongly predictive of status among girls than among boys. Moreover, the positive effects of both types of status on defending were-albeit to a limited extent-stronger in classrooms with higher anti-bullying norms.

Linguistic, affective, parental, and educational contributions to the bicultural identity development of Balkan minority adolescents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study investigated linguistic, affective, parental, and educational contributions to bicultural identity, in two samples of younger (13- to 14-year-old; N = 95) and older (16- to 17-year-old; N = 67) bilingual adolescents, who were immigrants or belonged to ethnic minority communities in the Balkans. While bicultural identity level was not differentiated as a function of age group, there was an age-related shift in its predictors. Bicultural identity level was significantly predicted by perceived educators' attitudes toward linguistic/cultural diversity in the younger adolescent group, but by personal affective states (motivation and attitudes) toward the mainstream language in the older adolescent group. Implications of the findings are discussed regarding educational and family practices that would facilitate biculturalism in minority adolescents.

A network analysis approach	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study's first aim was to explore whether stigma's facets differ between internalizing and externalizing disorders in adolescence. The second aim was to compare the relationships among stigma's facets toward these disorders. Two vignettes depicting a peer with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) were used with 616 adolescents in Italy. A Repeated measure MANOVA showed biogenetic causes, social distancing, and discomfort were more attributed to depression, while dangerousness to ADHD. Furthermore, a Psychometric Network Analysis showed no differences between these disorders in the relations among stigma's components. However, dangerousness seemed to be among the nodes with the highest levels of "strength, " confirming previous literature that shows that dangerousness plays a major role in stigma.

Elementary school students in China (N = 2204, 54.9% boys, M-age = 9.47 years) completed relevant measures on six occasions, every 6 months. Latent class growth modeling revealed four heterogeneous developmental trajectories of positivity: High-Increasing (50.6%), Moderate Low-Increasing (33.2%), Low-Stable (11.0%), and High-Decreasing (5.2%). Perceived parental warmth and satisfaction of relatedness and competence needs at school significantly predicted trajectory class membership. Findings underscore the value of identifying group difference in positivity development in youth and the need for specific interventions targeting their unique characteristics.

The sample comprised 1508 participants (60.7% female; baseline mean age = 16.33, SD = .62; 52.9% high perceived family wealth; 70.6% born in Norway). We used a random intercept cross-lagged panel model to investigate the concurrent and subsequent associations between the two constructs. The results indicated (1) small to moderate and negative associations between the trait-like components and within-person fluctuations of social self-efficacy and psychological distress, (2) positive and significant carry-over stability effects on both constructs across time, and (3) that psychological distress predicted subsequent social self-efficacy more consistently across four time points, than social self-efficacy predicted later psychological distress.

Coping with Relationship Stress in Adolescence: A Decade in Review	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												At a moment in history when stress levels among adolescents are high and coping capacities are taxed, it seems timely and important to review a decade's accomplishments in elucidating how, and with what effects, adolescents cope with relationship stress. We provide an update on research about coping with parent, peer, and romantic stress and discuss the effectiveness of coping strategies across cultures, developmental periods, and levels of social stress. We explore relations between coping and other automatic and reflective responses to stress and highlight innovations in lab-based and ambulatory assessments. We recommend studies of variability in the success of coping at different intensities of relationship stress and research with real-time and repeated assessments to capture the process of coping.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				DEC	2021	31	4			SI		1047	1067		10.1111/jora.12603	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12603								34820959					WOS:000722160700014

Positive Youth Development in 2020: Theory, Research, Programs, and the Promotion of Social Justice	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												We use Hamilton's (1999) tripartite conception of the positive youth development (PYD) literature - that is, PYD as a theoretical construct, PYD as a frame for program design, and PYD as an instance of specific youth development programs - as a framework for reviewing scholarship involved in the PYD field across the second decade of the 21st century. Advances were made in all three domains and, as well, new issues emerged; chief among them was a focus on the promotion of social justice. We discuss ways in which social justice issues are being addressed within each of these domains and we present a vision for enhancing the PYD-social justice relation in future scholarship involving theory, research, program design, and community-based PYD programs.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				DEC	2021	31	4			SI		1114	1134		10.1111/jora.12609	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12609								34820946					WOS:000722160700017

Two samples of late adolescents (Ns = 237, 298) aged 18 to 25 years completed measures of feeling needed and useful by family and friends. Feeling needed and useful by family and friends did not differ across demographic groups, was associated with greater received support, and predicted psychological well-being above-and-beyond received support.

This prospective longitudinal study examined whether internalizing problems during the pandemic could be predicted by precrisis friend support, and whether this effect was moderated by the time adolescents spent with their friends and COVID-19-related stress. 245 Dutch adolescents (M-age = 11.60) participated before and during COVID-19. Higher pre-COVID-19 friend support predicted less (self-reported and parent-reported) internalizing problems during COVID-19, and this effect was not moderated by the time adolescents spent with friends or COVID-19-related stress. Friends may thus protect against developing internalizing symptoms in times of crisis. We also found the reverse effect: Internalizing problems before COVID-19 were predictive of friend support during COVID-19.

Polyvictimization (co-occurrence of multiple types of victimization) may be an important, underresearched correlate of this disparity. With the 2017 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (N = 13,179), national estimates of polyvictimization and suicide risk were assessed among high school students by sexual minority status (SM vs. heterosexual), and multivariate relationships between sexual minority status, polyvictimization, and suicide risk were tested. Additionally, risk profiles of those who experienced polyvictimization (2 + types of victimization; n = 1,932) were compared across sexual minority status. Results confirm that SMA are more likely to experience polyvictimization than heterosexual adolescents (31.8% v. 12.9%, respectively); however, also indicate that polyvictimization does not fully explain elevated suicide risk among SMA.

This research examined whether associations between ethnic-racial socialization messages and psychosocial adjustment vary by ethnicity and perceived neighborhood quality in a nationally representative sample of Black adolescents who participated in the National Survey of American Life Adolescent supplement study. The effects of promotion of mistrust messages varied by ethnicity, and the effects of egalitarianism messages varied depending on perceived neighborhood quality.

JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Negotiating conflict in healthy ways is key to adolescents' social functioning. This paper examines interpersonal negotiation strategies (INS) (a developmental framework for navigating conflict) across three different contexts (friend, romantic, and parent) in a sample of 212 Canadian mid-adolescents. Adolescents were asked how they would deal with a hypothetical conflict in each context. Adolescents were most advanced at negotiating conflict in the friend context, followed by parent and romantic contexts; negotiation skills were worst in the romantic context. Girls demonstrated a higher level of INS than boys, but only with friends. These results indicate the need for universal healthy relationship programs that support the development of conflict negotiation skills, especially within the new interpersonal context of romantic relationships.

Third-Party Intervention in Peer Victimization: Self-Evaluative Emotions and Appraisals of a Diverse Adolescent Sample	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												African American, European American, Mexican American, and Native American adolescents (N = 270) described how they felt and appraised their own actions in response to a peer's victimization. Analyses compared times they had calmed victim emotions, amplified anger, avenged, and resolved conflicts peacefully. Adolescents felt prouder, more helpful, more like a good friend, and expected more peer approval after calming and resolving than after amplifying anger or avenging peers. They also felt less guilt and shame after calming and resolving. Avenging elicited more positive self-evaluation than amplifying. Epistemic network analyses explored links between self-evaluative and other emotions. Pride was linked to relief after efforts to calm or resolve.

Adolescent temperament moderated several links between parental knowledge and its sources and adolescent substance use. The most pronounced moderating results were found for those adolescents with fearless, socially detached and thrill-seeking tendencies. For these "detached thrill-seekers", bidirectional links between adolescent disclosure and substance use, and negative links between parental solicitation and substance use were found. We recommend, therefore, that adolescent temperament is considered when designing parenting programs.

Developmental Changes and Individual Differences in Trust and Reciprocity in Adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												A Trust Game was used to examine trust and reciprocity development in 12-18-year-old-adolescents (N = 496), as findings have been conflicting and transitions in adolescence remain elusive. Furthermore, this study tested the roles of gender, risk, and individual differences in empathy, impulsivity, and antisocial tendencies in trust and reciprocity. Results indicate stability in trust and a decrease in reciprocity across adolescence, but also show that trust and reciprocity choices were influenced by risk, and that empathy mediated the age-related decrease in reciprocity. Males trusted more than females, but there were no gender differences in reciprocity.

Effect of Environmental Risk and Externalizing Comorbidity on Internalizing Problems Among Economically Disadvantaged African American Youth	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined the effects of racial discrimination, community violence, and stressful life events on internalizing problems among African American youth from high-poverty neighborhoods (N = 607; 293 boys; M-age = 16.0 years, SD = 1.44 years). Mediated effects via externalizing problems on these relations were also examined, given the high comorbidity rate between internalizing and externalizing problems. Externalizing problems partially mediated the effect of stressful life events on internalizing problems and fully mediated the effect of racial discrimination for boys but not for girls.

Gender Differences in the Developmental Links Between Conduct Problems and Depression Across Early Adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Various developmental models have attempted to explain the relationship between antisocial behavior and depressive symptoms in youth, often proposing intermediary processes such as social and academic functioning. However, few studies have tested these developmental models fully, particularly in mixed-gender samples. The current study strives to fill this gap in the literature, examining these processes in an early adolescent sample. Results indicated both direct and indirect paths between antisocial behavior and depression. In addition, potentially important gender differences were found. These results underscore the importance of examining direct and indirect links between symptoms of depression and antisocial behavior and suggest that there may be important developmental differences between girls and boys in the relationship between these symptoms.

JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examines whether changes in impulse control and sensation-seeking across adolescence and early adulthood reflect independent or interdependent developmental processes. Data are drawn from a national longitudinal study (N = 8,270; 49% female; 33% Black, 22% Hispanic, 45% non-Black, non-Hispanic). An autoregressive latent trajectory model is used to test whether development in one trait influences development in the other. Although levels of these traits are inversely correlated, we do not find evidence that change over time in either trait is influenced by the prior level of the other. This failure to reject the null hypothesis is consistent with the view that sensation-seeking and impulse control are the products of distinct neuropsychological systems that develop independently of one another.

This study examines the role of number of sex partners in explaining the immigrant paradox in pregnancy among Latina adolescents. This secondary analysis utilized a nationally representative sample of Latinas in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. As expected, first-generation Latina adolescents demonstrated less risk than second- or third+ generation Latinas for becoming pregnant. Further, the lower number of sexual partners fully accounted for the first generation's advantage in lower rate of adolescent pregnancy. These findings have important implications for healthcare providers who work with Latina girls in pregnancy prevention.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				MAR	2015	25	1					14	19		10.1111/jora.12096	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12096													WOS:000350125300002

Although there is a wealth of data on youth gangs available from criminological research, there is a relatively small empirical and theoretical developmental literature on youth gangs. Indeed, only a handful of studies have addressed critical developmental issues on youth gangs. This special section presents five new studies approaching the study of youth gangs from a broad developmental perspective, underscoring the need for ongoing inquiry linking the heretofore separate literatures on youth gangs and antisocial peer influence from criminology and developmental science.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2014	24	2			SI		201	203		10.1111/jora.12141	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12141													WOS:000337571500001

The current study extends research on the role of reward sensitivity in peer influence by examining whether preferential attention to positive emotional stimuli predicts behavior in peer interactions, and whether this association is moderated by attachment style in a sample of 36 same-sex peer dyads. Positive attentional bias was associated with lower autonomy and greater avoidance with peers. This association was attenuated among individuals with secure attachment style. Attention to negative stimuli was associated with less avoidant and more hostile behavior during peer interactions. Results suggest that preferential attention to positive emotional stimuli is associated with greater susceptibility to peer influence, particularly in individuals low in secure attachment.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				DEC	2013	23	4					605	613		10.1111/jora.12026	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12026													WOS:000326945400002

Results showed that youth tended to select their friends based on similarity in popularity more than similarity in aggression or prosociality.

JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Using longitudinal data from a subsample of Hispanic, African American, and White youth enrolled in the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (N = 1,419), we examined the effects of both parental involvement in domestic violence and youth participation in organized out-of-school-time activities on internalizing symptoms during adolescence. We also examined the extent to which participation in organized activities protected youth against the internalizing consequences of domestic violence. We found that intensive participation in either afterschool programs or extracurricular activities was inversely associated with youth internalizing problems. Moreover, we found that intensive participation in afterschool programs weakened the association between parents' domestic violence and youths' internalizing problems.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2012	22	4					662	677		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2012.00811.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2012.00811.x								23162370					WOS:000311107000007

About 1,700 adolescents aged 1116 similar to years at Time 1 self-reported levels of both bullying and victimization in four contexts (in school, outside of school, texting, and on-line) annually for 2 similar to years. Results indicated that all four dynamics were moderately stable over time. The following variables were found to bidirectionally reinforce and predict each other over time: traditional bullying and traditional victimization; traditional bullying and cyber bullying; and traditional victimization and cyber victimization.

Braking and Accelerating of the Adolescent Brain	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Adolescence is a developmental period often characterized as a time of impulsive and risky choices leading to increased incidence of unintentional injuries and violence, alcohol and drug abuse, unintended pregnancy, and sexually transmitted diseases. Traditional neurobiological and cognitive explanations for such suboptimal choices and actions have failed to account for nonlinear changes in behavior observed during adolescence, relative to childhood and adulthood. This review provides a biologically plausible conceptualization of the mechanisms underlying these nonlinear changes in behavior, as an imbalance between a heightened sensitivity to motivational cues and immature cognitive control. Recent human imaging and animal studies provide a biological basis for this view, suggesting differential development of subcortical limbic systems relative to top-down control systems during adolescence relative to childhood and adulthood. This work emphasizes the importance of examining transitions into and out of adolescence and highlights emerging avenues of future research on adolescent brain development.

This sample is unique in that participants were subject to an unusual level of environmental risk early in life and resided in foster care at the start of the study. Analyses replicated the previously established association between sexual abuse and earlier onset of maturation and earlier age at menarche. Physical abuse was related to a more rapid tempo of pubertal development across the period assessed.

Family Structure, Family Processes, and Adolescent Smoking and Drinking	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined whether family structure was associated with adolescent risk behaviors, including smoking and drinking. Family living arrangements have become increasingly diverse, yet research on adolescent risk behaviors has typically relied on measures of family structure that do not adequately capture this diversity. Data from the 1994-1995 National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were used to conduct logistic regression analyses that revealed adolescents in two biological married parent families were least likely to smoke or drink, whereas adolescents in cohabiting stepfamilies were most likely. Those in single-mother families and married stepfamilies were in between. Maternal socialization was related to reduced odds of smoking and drinking. Maternal modeling was positively associated with smoking and drinking. Family structure is indicative of distinct family processes that are linked to risky behaviors among adolescents.																			1050-8392						2010	20	2					259	273		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00636.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00636.x								20543893					WOS:000277710900001

A Reinterpretation of Parental Monitoring in Longitudinal Perspective	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												A commonly used measure of parental monitoring is parents' knowledge of adolescents' daily activities. This measure has been criticized on the grounds that parents get more knowledge about teenagers' daily activities through willing youth disclosure than through their own active monitoring efforts, but this claim was based on cross-sectional data. In the present study, we reexamine this claim with longitudinal data over 2 years from 938 seventh and eighth graders and their parents. Youth disclosure was a significant longitudinal predictor of parental knowledge in single- and cross-rater models. Neither measure of parents' monitoring efforts-control or solicitation-was a significant predictor. In analyses involving delinquency, parental monitoring efforts did not predict changes in delinquency over time, but youth disclosure did. We conclude that because knowledge measures do not seem to represent parental monitoring efforts, the conclusions from studies using these measures should be reinterpreted.

An implication of POCT is that the presence of siblings will increase conflict in biological parent-child dyads, and that half siblings will increase that conflict more than full siblings. Evidence consistent with this prediction was found in a longitudinal study of 236 early adolescent children and their mothers. Following parental disruption, the entry of younger maternal half siblings into the home was uniquely associated with elevated conflict between mothers and their biological children, independent of the effects of family size, socioeconomic status, and maternal depression. As predicted by the model, the effect of parental disruption on mother-child conflict was partially mediated by the entry of half siblings (but not stepfathers) into the home.

We hypothesized that ethnicity would moderate such effects. As part of a larger study, 511 adolescents (154 European, 205 Hispanic, and 152 Asian Americans) participated in this research. They were surveyed shortly before their high school graduation and again 1 year later. Analyses based on 2-wave cross-lagged models showed that higher levels of initial depressive symptoms predicted lower levels of subsequent perceived parental and peer warmth for European Americans. For Asian Americans, higher initial depressed mood was significantly associated with lower levels of perceived peer warmth and was marginally associated with lower levels of parental warmth. In contrast, the erosion of parental and peer warmth was not evident for Hispanic Americans. The role of culture in the erosion of parental and peer warmth during life transitions was discussed.					chen, huan/GXZ-8858-2022	Chen, Chuansheng/0000-0002-8224-1005													1050-8392	1532-7795					2009	19	3					359	379		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00592.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00592.x													WOS:000269058100001

Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) was used to identify developmental typologies of both identity formation (i.e., dimensions of commitment and exploration) and adjustment (i.e., depressive symptoms and self-esteem). Four trajectory classes emerged for identity, three of which had been suggested earlier in the literature (Josselson, 1996): Pathmakers, Guardians, and Searchers. The fourth trajectory class was labeled Consolidators and consisted of individuals characterized by a strong focus on strengthening their current identity commitments, at the expense of a thorough exploration of alternative options. Three trajectory classes were identified for adjustment: Optimal Adjustment, Moderate Adjustment, and Stable Maladjustment. Each of the four identity trajectory classes was associated with a specific profile of adjustment, with the Searchers showing the poorest profile and the Pathmakers and Consolidators the most positive profile. Practical implications and suggestions for future research are outlined.

Using a grounded theory approach, five general themes emerged in the responses, corresponding to open communication, instrumental and emotional support, indirect expressions of caring, parental control, and valued relationship qualities. Both genders described distinct relationships with mothers and fathers. Relationships with mothers were closer and more open than relationships with fathers, and mothers were seen as being more affectionate, lenient, and emotionally supportive, whereas fathers tended to express caring indirectly by providing instrumental and financial support and by just being there. Parental upbringing, culture, gender, and parental role expectations emerged as explanations for parents' behavior. Theoretical, methodological, and practical implications are discussed.

Studying and stressful demands during the day were modestly but consistently associated with less sleep that evening. Receiving less sleep at night, in turn, was modestly but consistently related to higher levels of anxiety, depressive feelings, and fatigue during the following day. In addition, the daily variability in adolescents' sleep time was notable and just as important for the youths' average levels of daily psychological well-being as was the average amount of time spent sleeping each night. A small number of ethnic and gender differences emerged in the dynamics of adolescent sleep, activities, and well-being.

This study focused on situational and personal characteristics that may make such behaviors more or less upsetting. Six hundred and thirty two Quebecois high-school students in Grades 8-11 completed questionnaires regarding their experience with potentially offensive sexual behaviors. Behaviors experienced at the hand of a close friend were less upsetting than those experienced at the hand of other peers. Compared with high self-esteem peers, students with lower self-esteem were more upset by such behaviors and were more likely to perceive the perpetrator's intent as unacceptable. In addition to sex of target, self-esteem, and relationship with the perpetrator, the attribution of unacceptable intent to the perpetrator predicted upset ratings.																			1050-8392						2006	16	2					229	237		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2006.00130.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2006.00130.x													WOS:000236942900004

JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This article explores the relationship between parental psychological control and parental autonomy granting, and the relations between these constructs and indicators of adolescent psychosocial functioning, in a sample of 9,564 adolescents from grades 9 to 12. Participants completed a comprehensive parenting questionnaire as well as several measures of psychosocial adjustment. Confirmatory factor analyses of the parenting items revealed discrete factors for psychological control and autonomy granting, suggesting that these are distinct parenting constructs rather than opposite ends of a parental control continuum. Moreover, structural equation modeling showed that these factors were weakly correlated and differentially related to adolescent internalizing symptoms. Findings have implications for future conceptualization and measurement of psychological control and autonomy granting, and for research examining their effects on adolescent development.

Fifty mother-adolescent dyads reported on their conversations about sexual issues and participated in videotaped conversations about dating and sexuality in a laboratory setting. Gender differences (more mother-daughter than mother-son) were found in the extent of sexual communication based on adolescents' reports, but no gender differences were found based on mothers' reports, or on observations of conversations. Aspects of laboratory interactions, however, did distinguish mother-daughter and mother-son dyads, and related to self-report measures. Girls' reported sexuality communication frequency related to behavior in the laboratory setting. During mother-son conversations, one person usually took on the role of questioner, whereas the other did not. In contrast, there was evidence for mutuality of positive emotions for mother-daughter dyads, but not for mother-son dyads.

J	Sim, TN				Sim, TN			Adolescent psychosocial competence: The importance and role of regard for parents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined the importance and role of regard for parents (i.e., how important parents are regarded) for psychosocial competence, as indicated by self-esteem and susceptibility to antisocial peer pressure. Participants were 555 Singapore adolescents in 4 secondary levels (equivalent to Grades 7-10). Results showed that regard for parents was positively related to psychosocial competence, being positively associated with self-esteem and negatively associated with antisocial susceptibility. More interesting, regard for parents was found to have a role in 2 well-established relations between parental practices and psychosocial competence. Regard for parents moderated the relation between parental support and self-esteem (the relation being stronger when regard for parents was high) and mediated the relation between parental monitoring and antisocial susceptibility. These results suggest a need to consider regard for parents for a better understanding of the parent-adolescent dynamics in adolescent psychosocial competence.																			1050-8392						2000	10	1					49	64		10.1207/SJRA1001_3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/SJRA1001_3													WOS:000084832600003

Among Asian Americans, differences in mean number of sexual partners were not associated with differences in generational status, ethnic subgroup, or level of acculturation as indicated by language usage at home. As expected, Caucasian Americans reported having had more sexual partners by late adolescence to young adulthood than did Asian Americans, and males reported having had more partners than females, especially among Caucasian Americans. Measures of peer interactions and attitudinal and dispositional characteristics showed consistent relations with number of sexual partners, but measures of perceived family relationships did not. In light of the age group under study, discriminant analyses were used to explore those attributes that distinguish between virgins and nonvirgins, as well as between individuals reporting only one or two partners and those reporting more. Results showed that two discriminant functions formed from five key variables (involvement in risky behaviors, endorsement of casual sex, perceived physical attractiveness, reported success in forming romantic relationships, and religiosity) were successful in predicting three levels of sexual experience for 61% to 92% of the individuals in the groups studied.					chen, huan/GXZ-8858-2022	Chen, Chuansheng/0000-0002-8224-1005													1050-8392						1997	7	1					33	53		10.1207/s15327795jra0701_3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0701_3													WOS:A1997WB42800003

One hundred eight homeless and runaway adolescents were interviewed directly on the streets and in shelters by outreach workers in youth services agencies. Levels of physical and sexual abuse within family of origin, participation in deviant subsistence strategies, and levels of victimization while on the streets are reported. Path analysis indicated that abusive family backgrounds had a positive direct effect on victimization of adolescents on the streets, and indirectly increased the likelihood of victimization by increasing the amount of time at risk, deviant peer associations, and risky behaviors.

We compared 3 groups (N = 123): those with arithmetic/written work disability, those with reading disability, and those who were normally achieving. The youths' abilities were assessed using the Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised subtests, Woodcock Word Attack subtest, and experimental reading tasks. Reading and spelling errors were also analyzed. Prevalence rates were as follows: reading disability (52%), arithmetic/written work disability (28.5%), and normally achieving (19.5%). Reading difficulty in the reading disability group was characterized by a severe deficit in phonological processing. The groups did not differ in reported history of substance abuse, maltreatment, adjudication-court involvement, unemployment, school attendance, grade repetitions, or special education services. The findings identify an important need for agencies serving this population to incorporate reeducation efforts in their service plans, thereby reducing risk and improving quality of life for this population.

In addition to global feelings of self-worth, the SEQ assesses evaluations of the self relating to each primary context of early adolescent development (peers, school, and family) and 2 additional salient domains of experience for this age group (sports/athletics and body image). Results provide support for the proposed developmental-ecological framework as well as the reliability and validity of the SEQ. Major findings include factorial validity for the targeted dimensions of self-esteem and convergent and discriminant validity across self-report, interview, and parent-report forms of the instrument. Ratings for specific dimensions of self-esteem also exhibited differentially strong associations with measures of contextual experiences in corresponding areas.

This study investigates a mediational model for emotional expression and delinquency in which specific emotions were tested as contexts for parental supervision of adolescents. A model was presented in which the relationship between emotions and later delinquency was fully mediated through a measure of Lax Supervision. Maternal humor as a main effect, the interaction term for maternal and adolescent contempt, and certain levels of adolescent neutral explained variance in Lax Supervision. Fathers' emotions did not contribute significant effects in the models. No direct relationship was found between emotional expression and Delinquent Peer Association or Delinquency. Lax Supervision and Delinquent Peer Association had large effects on Delinquency, as hypothesized, with 35% of the variance of Delinquency explained in the model.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					1994	4	4					601	614		10.1207/s15327795jra0404_10	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0404_10													WOS:A1994QL36700010

However, it is unclear how family can influence adolescents' quality of contact in different life contexts. This study aims to fill this gap. A sample of 702 Italian adolescents (Mage = 15.61, SDage = 1.11, 48.58% girls) and their parents (615 mothers, Mage = 48.45, SDage = 4.34; 487 fathers, Mage = 51.22, SDage = 4.92) completed questionnaires at two time points. Cross-lagged models indicated that adolescents' intergroup contact at T1 was associated with mothers' contact over time, mainly in structured (i.e., school and work) contexts. No significant associations were found regarding fathers' intergroup contact and unstructured contexts. These results shed new light on the process of family transmission during adolescence, particularly regarding intergroup dynamics.

J	Espinoza, CN; Goering, M; Mrug, S				Espinoza, Carlos N.; Goering, Marlon; Mrug, Sylvie			Inter-parental conflict and empathy in early adolescence as predictors of dating violence perpetration in adolescence and adulthood	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Witnessing inter-parental conflict is associated with dating violence perpetration in late adolescence and adulthood. This relationship may be moderated by adolescents' empathy, with more empathic youth viewing their parents' conflict behavior as less acceptable, and thus refraining from dating violence perpetration. This study sought to determine if empathy buffers the effects of inter-parental conflict in early adolescence on expected dating violence perpetration in early adolescence and actual dating violence perpetration in late adolescence and adulthood. Moreover, this study tested if expected dating violence perpetration in early adolescence and dating violence perpetration in late adolescence mediate the effects of inter-parental conflict and empathy on dating violence perpetration in adulthood. Sex differences in these relationships were also examined. The sample included 412 adolescents (52% male, 73% Black, 25% White, 2% Other) who participated at three time points between 2006 and 2022 (T1-T3, Mean age = 13, 18, 28 years). Results indicated that higher inter-parental conflict and lower empathy were associated with higher expected dating violence perpetration at T1 in both males and females. Inter-parental conflict at T1 predicted higher dating violence perpetration at T3 through expected dating violence perpetration at T1 and dating violence perpetration at T2. Empathy at T1 predicted lower dating violence perpetration at T3 directly and also indirectly through lower expected dating violence at T1 and lower dating violence perpetration at T2 in both sexes. There were no interaction effects of inter-parental conflict and empathy on expected or actual dating violence perpetration at any age.

Towards a decolonial developmental science: Adolescent development in the Majority World taking center stage	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												While aspiring to be a diverse and global science, developmental science continues to be dominated by EuroAmerican epistemologies, researchers, and communities in its published scholarship. Adolescents in communities across Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America comprise 85% of the world's adolescent population, and yet their experiences and perspectives are marginalized in our science. Adolescents in the Majority World live in highly diverse social, cultural, political, economic, educational and healthcare contexts that contribute to their development, and we have much to learn from their experiences. This article situates the marginalization of the global majority within coloniality embedded in developmental science. The article describes the impetus for this special issue Towards a decolonial developmental science and the process of putting it together, along with providing an overview of the 18 articles in this collection that push us towards decoloniality. The special issue serves as a call to transform developmental science to be decolonial by empowering adolescent development in Majority World communities to take center stage. Adolescent development research from Majority World communities has the potential to challenge the knowledge base generated from Minority World samples, contributing to a science that is comprehensive, inclusive, and can inform prevention and intervention efforts to support the well-being of adolescents globally.

Using interviewee-created graphs to explore the arc of closeness and trust in adolescents' supportive relationships with nonparental adults	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Adolescents' supportive relationships with nonparental adults are beneficial when they are close and have trust, but few studies explore how adolescents believe closeness and trust unfold over time. I propose a method for prompting adolescents to retrospectively describe the development of abstract components of such relationships by sharing a study that used interviewee-created graphing to prompt adolescents to move from concrete parts of the relationship to abstract concepts using a tool adolescents would be familiar with from math classes. Analyses using Venn diagrams and matrices suggested adolescents conceptualized closeness and trust differently, however, this was shaped by whether the adult was a part of their family. Reflections on how the proposed graphing method can effectively be used will be discussed.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				SEP	2024	34	3					1078	1098		10.1111/jora.12965	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12965		MAY 2024						38750409					WOS:001223595600001

Pubertal status and body image: An inquiry into experiences of adolescents in Ghana and Kenya	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The current study uses a mixed method design to investigate Kenyan and Ghanaian adolescents' experiences of puberty, and the relations between gender, country of origin, pubertal status, and body image appraisals (N = 86; Ghana = 46, Kenya = 40, 52.9% female aged 13 and 14). Qualitative results revealed seven major themes; puberty means a universal period of growth and transition into adulthood but also evokes negative emotions of shame, anxiety, and embarrassment, being in sync with peers during puberty is important and knowing that others in their lives similarly experience puberty is reassuring. Quantitative results revealed significant gender and country differences in pubertal status and body image. Ghanaian adolescents had more advanced pubertal status and more positive body image appraisals compared to Kenyan adolescents. Moderation analysis results revealed that for the Kenyan sample, post-pubertal males had less favorable body image appraisals than their counterparts who were still pre pubertal whilst for females, post-pubertal girls had more favorable body images than their counterparts. No such effects were observed with the Ghanaian sample. The findings highlight the need for context considerations in understanding body image during the pubertal transition to help identify relevant protective factors for possible interventions. The results affirm the importance of positive body image promotions for adolescents within the African context and suggest the need for much more comprehensive sex education with gender-specific components to help allay fears about puberty, thus preventing the development of possible adaptation problems.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2024	34	2			SI		257	271		10.1111/jora.12953	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12953		APR 2024						38659355					WOS:001207582000001

This study examines the development of justice perceptions in 659 Brazilian adolescents (51.3% male; 45.2% White) in Sao Paulo across 3 years, ages 12, 13, and 14. Perceptions of justice of the world declined with age and perceived justice in one's personal life differed across ethnic, economic, and educational groups. Privileged groups differentiated more between their evaluations of the world and their personal lives. K-means clustering revealed five trajectories of justice beliefs, which significantly differed across school type, race/ethnicity, and income levels. Evidence suggests that personal belief in a just world reflects known social group inequalities.

The measure showed strong psychometric properties including good reliability and factor structure, expected associations with daily experiences of slut-related victimization and sexual harassment, and links with number of sexual partners and other forms of peer victimization. Slut-shaming was associated with distress accounting for these other forms of victimization (including sexual harassment), suggesting the pertinence of addressing this type of gender-based victimization.

Subjective well-being and school engagement before versus during the COVID-19 pandemic: What good are positive emotions?	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The present study overcomes the limited empirical evidence on the association between well-being and school engagement in times of adversity by exploiting available data from two large and comparable samples of eighth graders; one obtained prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and the second obtained during the pandemic. Results suggest that adolescents were less engaged with their learning context during the pandemic, as well as lower in positive and negative affect, but slightly more satisfied with life.

Using machine learning to identify early predictors of adolescent emotion regulation development	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												As 20% of adolescents develop emotion regulation difficulties, it is important to identify important early predictors thereof. Using the machine learning algorithm SEM-forests, we ranked the importance of (87) candidate variables assessed at age 13 in predicting quadratic latent trajectory models of emotion regulation development from age 14 to 18. Participants were 497 Dutch families. Results indicated that the most important predictors were individual differences (e.g., in personality), aspects of relationship quality and conflict behaviors with parents and peers, and internalizing and externalizing problems. Relatively less important were demographics, bullying, delinquency, substance use, and specific parenting practices-although negative parenting practices ranked higher than positive ones. We discuss implications for theory and interventions, and present an open source risk assessment tool, ERRATA.

Data came from the National Study of Youth and Religion. Participants were religiously affiliated for the first three waves of the longitudinal study (N = 1144). Latent growth curve models found significant declines across adolescence in church attendance, prayer, scripture study, religious importance, and spirituality, whereas doubt was stable across time. Then, logistic regression models specified the latent intercepts and slopes as predictors of later (Wave 4) deidentification. Significant negative links were found for the intercepts and slopes on church attendance, prayer, scripture study, religious importance, and spirituality. For doubt, a significant, positive link was found for the intercept.

We studied the impact of preexisting psychosocial factors and pandemic-related financial and social disruptions in relation to family well-being among N = 4091 adolescents and parents during early summer 2020, participating in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development(SM) Study. Poorer family well-being was linked to prepandemic psychosocial and financial adversity and was associated with pandemic-related material hardship and social disruptions to routines. Parental alcohol use increased risk for worsening of family relationships, while a greater endorsement of coping strategies was mainly associated with overall better family well-being. Financial and mental health support may be critical for family well-being during and after a widespread crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Recent studies suggest promising outcomes from transformative student voice (TSV) programming, but more work is needed that assesses the impact of TSV participation for youth of color. We surveyed 294 students from 12 public high schools and found that students in TSV activities reported more critical reflection, sociopolitical efficacy, and participation in sociopolitical action than their non-TSV peers. Additionally, using regression analysis, we found that years of involvement in TSV activities predicted participation in sociopolitical action.

We examined whether racial discrimination restricts ethnic-racial minority access to high-achieving STEM schools. We conducted an audit correspondence experiment to investigate racial discrimination in guidance counselor responsiveness to 976 emails from fictitious Asian, Black, Latina, and White mothers inquiring about school enrollment. Moderation analyses revealed that guidance counselors restricted access from Asian mothers at schools characterized as rural, lower socioeconomic status, and higher STEM prestige-evidence of gatekeeping points to the restriction of Asian students from advanced STEM opportunities. Results are situated within educational audit experiments to objectively document how racism from multiple facets of the education system intersect to inhibit ethnic-racial minority youth.

Researchers conducted interviews with 17 self-identified Black boys who were part of a larger school-based partnership called The Black Boy Mattering Project. Participants reported experiencing and resisting interpersonal marginal mattering (e.g., evidenced in negative interactions with educators and peers and fueled by racist stereotypes) and described mattering partially through selective love (e.g., inferring significance through athletics, yet deemed anti-intellectual). Our study exhibits how schools uphold systemic anti-Black racist notions that shape relationships between Black boys and their peers and educators and diminish adolescents' self-concepts. Implications aim to support educators and researchers in radically affirming Black boys in school contexts.

Dynamics of Identity Development in Adolescence: A Decade in Review	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												One of the key developmental tasks in adolescence is to develop a coherent identity. The current review addresses progress in the field of identity research between the years 2010 and 2020. Synthesizing research on the development of identity, we show that identity development during adolescence and early adulthood is characterized by both systematic maturation and substantial stability. This review discusses the role of life events and transitions for identity and the role of micro-processes and narrative processes as a potential mechanisms of personal identity development change. It provides an overview of the linkages between identity development and developmental outcomes, specifically paying attention to within-person processes.

Participants were 208 US adolescents (M-age = 15.09, SD = 0.50, 48.8% female, 86.1% White; 40.9% COVID group) who completed longitudinal surveys assessing psychosocial adjustment and related risk/protective factors (e.g., emotion regulation, well-being pursuits). Only adolescents completing Wave 3 during COVID-19 experienced increases in depressive symptoms, negative affect, and isolation and decreases in positive affect and friendship. Several variables served as risk (i.e., dampening) and protective (i.e., eudaimonic and hedonic motives) factors of these changes. Findings highlight the range of factors that are distinctly associated with negative changes in adolescent adjustment during COVID-19.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				SEP	2021	31	3			SI		546	559		10.1111/jora.12667	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12667								34448304					WOS:000690772700006

This study assessed six cohorts of American 12th graders (2012-2017) to examine trends in youths' attitudes about themselves, the future, and others surrounding the U.S. 2016 presidential race and election. Analyses assessed overall trends and variation by political affiliation. Results indicated a rise across cohorts in future pessimism and nihilism after 2015, driven by youth identified as Democrat rather than Republican. A rise in concern for others was similarly driven by Democrat youth, whereas a rise in value of diversity was shared across all political identities. In contrast, Republican youth cohorts reported increasing external locus of control relative to their Democratic peers.

Psychosocial Correlates and Consequences of Adolescents' Self-Generated Academic Goals and Appraisals	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The current study examined whether characteristics of adolescents (i.e., externalizing problems) and their environments (i.e., social support, adverse childhood experiences) relate to academic goal setting, appraisals, and outcomes. Adolescents (n = 99; 87% Black/African American) 13-16 years old completed baseline interviews, and 80% also completed follow-up interviews. Adolescents with more externalizing problems set fewer academic goals, and youth with social networks characterized by greater support (and less strain) appraised their academic goals as more supported and achievable. Adolescents' appraisals of their academic goals, but not how many academic goals they had, predicted grades at follow-up. Increasing social support (and reducing social strain) may foster adolescents' positive appraisals of their academic goals, which may promote academic achievement.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				MAR	2021	31	1					204	217		10.1111/jora.12593	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12593		NOV 2020						33159837					WOS:000587009300001

The sample included 167 dyads of adolescents (53% male;M-age = 14.07 years at Time 1) and their parents, assessed annually across 4 years. Parents reported socioeconomic variables at Time 1. Adolescents reported risk-taking behaviors at Times 1 and 4, and completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging cognitive control task at Times 2 and 3. Lower SES was associated with lower behavioral (but not neural) cognitive control, which was associated with increases in risk-taking behaviors. The findings suggest that elevated socioeconomic risk may compromise cognitive control which can cascade into maladaptive behaviors in adolescence.

Higher initial success with getting access to a peer group, building friendships, preparing for a future career, body acceptance, as well as developing a personal identity, a value system, and socially responsible behavior predicted lower levels of symptoms at follow-up and stronger declines of symptoms over time when controlling for initial symptom levels. Furthermore, higher initial symptom levels predicted lower attainment of these tasks at follow-up as well as lower progress in task attainment. In contrast, more initial romantic/sexual involvement predicted an increase in symptoms over time, while higher initial symptoms were related to an increase in romantic/sexual involvement. Associations with autonomy varied between different forms of autonomy, while acquisition of a gender role was not related with psychological symptoms.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				JAN	2020	30			1			4	14		10.1111/jora.12462	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12462								30367691					WOS:000508756700001

The sexual activities ranged from low (e.g., cuddling), moderate (e.g., kissing), to high (e.g., sexual intercourse) intensity. We found that most adolescents having sexual activities of low-to-moderate intensity with same-sex individuals also had them with other-sex individuals, and adolescents having other-sex contacts of low intensity often reported them nonexclusively. Furthermore, other-sex and same-sex sexual activities did not reliably distinguish between sexual orientation identities. Sex differences in these phenomena were absent or small. These findings suggest that many adolescents have low-intensity nonexclusive sexual behaviors.

Using the four most recent waves of data from the Zurich Project on the Social Development of Children and Youths (z-proso), we identified three classes, or separate groups, of youths with distinct patterns of victimization from age 11 to 17. The largest class represented young people who were least likely to be victimized in any way and at any time. The two smaller groups represented different types of poly-victimization-a non-parental and a long-term parental victimization group. Adolescents in the two groups differed both in the number as well as type of victimization that they experienced at different times.

Out-of-School Time and Behaviors During Adolescence	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Although adolescents experience an array of out-of-school time (OST) settings, research has primarily focused on these settings in isolation. This study examined time in four OST settings (unsupervised time with peers, paid employment, sports, and nonsports organized activities) in relation to adolescent functioning at age 15 and the end of high school. Individual fixed effects analyses provided a more rigorous control of selection into OST activities by controlling for time-invariant observable and unobservable characteristics. More unsupervised time with peers predicted increases in risky and externalizing behaviors, whereas increases in paid employment predicted gains in work orientation and self-identity. Time in organized sports was associated with increased positive self-identity, highlighting the value of expanding consideration of multiple OST contexts and selection effects.

Examining Discrimination, Ethnic-Racial Identity Status, and Youth Public Regard Among Black, Latino, and White Adolescents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												How positively adolescents believe others feel about their ethnic-racial group (i.e., public regard) is an important part of their ethnic-racial identity (ERI), which is likely informed by contextual and individual factors. Using cluster analyses to generate ERI statuses among Black, Latino, and White adolescents (n=1,378), we found that associations between peer versus adult discrimination and public regard varied across ERI status and ethnic-racial group. However, among all adolescents, an achieved ERI (i.e., having explored ethnicity-race and having a clear sense about its personal meaning) buffered the negative association between adult discrimination and public regard, but not between peer discrimination and public regard. Implications for understanding the interplay between contextual and individual factors for public regard are discussed.

Dennis			Context of First Same-Sex Condom Use and Nonuse in Young Black Gay and Bisexual Males	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Despite high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) rates among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM), there are limited data about condom use during first same-sex (FSS). This study sought to understand socio-contextual factors of 50 YBMSM aged 15-19 years that influenced condom use during FSS. Condom use was influenced by individual, partner, and community factors. Individual factors-recent illness or sexually transmitted infections (STI)-prompted condom use, while frequent HIV testing prompted nonuse. Partner factors-proactive encouragement from partners-prompted condom use, while trust and condom discomfort prompted nonuse. Larger community factors-such as presence of females-were key for use, while limited sexual health information combined with peers who discouraged condoms prompted nonuse. A multilevel approach may be useful in developing sexual health programming for these young men.

This study investigated whether classmates' levels of aggression and delinquency influenced individual antisocial behavior during the first year of secondary school. At this point, students had just transitioned to a new classroom peer environment. A short-term longitudinal design with four measurement points distributed across the school year was applied. Data were collected from the anonymous self-reports of 825 seventh graders. Longitudinal negative binomial multilevel analyses revealed that classmates' antisocial behavior influenced pupils' behavioral development (other peer influences were controlled). Furthermore, classroom behavioral heterogeneity moderated the peer effect regarding delinquency but not aggression.

The Role of Domain Content in Understanding Identity Development Processes	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The current studies examined the importance of domain content in the processes of identity development using two approaches-narrative and status. We examined personal narratives for identity domain content, the co-occurrence of different contents, and the relations between content and processes, using two approaches to identity-status and narrative. Across two studies, 762 participants (average age = 19 years) and 2214 narratives, traditional ideological and interpersonal status domains were present, but so was a novel domain: existential concerns. Narrative identity processes were more frequent in narratives with multiple contents, and relations between identity statuses processes and narrative processes were modest. We discuss theoretical implications, the importance of examining content, and the utility of narrative approaches for doing so.

Early Motherhood and Long-Term Economic Outcomes: Findings From a 30-Year Longitudinal Study	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined linkages between early motherhood (before age 20) and long-term economic disadvantage, using data from a birth cohort of 509 New Zealand-born women followed to age 30. Associations between early motherhood and economic outcomes were examined using linear and logistic regression models and were adjusted for a range of prepregnancy factors. The findings suggested that early motherhood was associated with several indicators of economic disadvantage at age 30, including working fewer hours, welfare dependence, lower personal incomes, and exposure to economic hardship. These associations remained statistically significant even after extensive adjustment for confounding factors. These findings suggest that having a child before age 20 leads to long-term economic disadvantage that persists for at least a decade.					; Boden, Joseph/C-3316-2009	Gibb, Sheree/0000-0002-9708-8816; Boden, Joseph/0000-0003-1502-1608; Horwood, L./0000-0003-4881-1956													1050-8392	1532-7795				MAR	2015	25	1					163	172		10.1111/jora.12122	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12122													WOS:000350125300016

Among these newcomers attending 66 high schools, associations between discrimination and school context were explored, including indices of school composition and school climate. Results showed that less discrimination was reported in schools with higher proportions of same-ethnicity peers and recent immigrants. Diversity support at school significantly predicted discrimination, beyond the effects of school composition. Ethnicity significantly moderated associations between diversity support and discrimination, indicating that the protective function of adults and peers at school differs for recent immigrants, depending on their ethnic background.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				DEC	2014	24	4					608	614		10.1111/jora.12089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12089													WOS:000344789500006

Popularity as a Moderator of Peer Selection and Socialization of Adolescent Alcohol, Marijuana, and Tobacco Use	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study examined prospective associations between late adolescents' friendships and substance use (alcohol, marijuana, tobacco) using a stochastic actor-based modeling approach and the moderating role of popularity. Participants were 450 adolescents (53% female, M age=15.5years) who completed surveys in grades 10 and 11. Results of a single multivariate model indicated that peer selection based on similar tobacco use was a more robust predictor of changes in friendship than selection based on similar alcohol and marijuana use; and peer socialization of alcohol use predicted more changes in adolescent-drinking behaviors. Popularity moderated selection based on alcohol use; popular adolescents were more likely to select friends with high levels of drinking behaviors. Popularity did not moderate peer socialization.

Cumulative risk and promotive factor indices represented individual characteristics, and peer, parental, and familial influences. Using growth curve modeling, we describe trajectories of cumulative risk and promotive factors and test the associations between the time-varying cumulative risk and promotive factor indices and violent behavior. Higher risk was associated with higher levels of violent behavior. Higher levels of promotive factors were associated with less violent behavior and moderated the association between risk and violent behaviors. The results support the risk-protective model of resiliency. Implications for prevention are discussed.

The objective of this mixed method study was to provide the first analysis of the student trustee role, a relatively new form of participation where high school students represent their peers on local school boards. Specifically, the aim was to gain an understanding of the meaning of student trustee participation from the perspectives of those in the role. Data collection included qualitative interviews with 16 participants, field observations, and questionnaires administered to 39 student trustees. This article focuses primarily on 2 main themes related to developmental processes and outcomes associated with youth participation. One theme identifies possible factors that may elicit or support youth participation while a second theme examines identity formation and transformative learning. Theories derived from human development and adult education comprise the conceptual framework that illuminates the meaning of student trustee participation.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2011	21	2					350	360		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00673.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00673.x													WOS:000290627300004

Participants were 3,312 adolescents (M age=13.60 years) from 172 classrooms in 32 schools. Four types of peer affiliations of the participants with the popular peers in their classrooms were distinguished: "best friends," "respected," "wannabes," and "unrelated." Two types of benefits of affiliating with high-status peers were identified: achieving high status or popularity for oneself and becoming liked by others. The results showed that popularity was associated with being closely affiliated with popular peers, whereas likability was more strongly predicted by a more distant relation with popular peers.

This paper examines 5 potential mediators: early sexual initiation, running away, juvenile crime, school problems, and early drug use. Using a prospective cohort design, abused and neglected children (ages 0-11) with cases processed during 1967-1971 were matched with nonabused, nonneglected children and followed into young adulthood. Data are from in-person interviews at approximately age 29 and arrest records through 1994. Structural equation modeling tested path models. Results indicated that victims of child abuse and neglect were at increased risk for all problem behaviors except drug use. In the full model, only early sexual initiation remained significant as a mediator in the pathway from child abuse and neglect to prostitution. Findings were generally consistent for physical and sexual abuse and neglect. These findings suggest that interventions to reduce problem behaviors among maltreated children may also reduce their risk for prostitution later in life.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2010	20	1					210	236		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00624.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2009.00624.x								20186260					WOS:000274701000011

Based on the action-phase model of developmental regulation, we investigated the effects of goal engagement on transition outcomes in a high-density longitudinal study of noncollege-bound German adolescents (N=362). Career-related goal engagement was important for attaining a desired career goal (i.e., apprenticeship) for girls who generally faced unfavorable employment opportunities. For boys, goal engagement did not predict the attainment of an apprenticeship. Goal engagement was nonetheless beneficial for well-being, predicting positive affect for both girls and boys. This effect was not mediated by attainment of an apprenticeship.

We considered whether depressive symptoms predicted changes in marijuana use and vice versa from high school through the transition into young adulthood. We also examined gender differences in these behaviors over time. The results indicated that depressive symptoms predicted later marijuana use only for males. Marijuana use did not predict later depressive symptoms for females or males. These findings are consistent with a unidirectional hypothesis indicating that marijuana use may play a role as mood regulator among young males, but not among females. Research findings also indicate that females with lower depressive symptoms use more marijuana than females who report high depressive symptoms. These findings did not change even after controlling for the effects of using other substances at previous stages, school achievement, and demographics factors. These results suggest that depressive symptoms may be an antecedent of marijuana use among African American males.					repetto, paula/E-5525-2015	Repetto, Paula/0000-0002-0331-7375													1050-8392	1532-7795					2008	18	3					421	447		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2008.00566.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2008.00566.x													WOS:000258380200002

Eighty male Israeli adolescents were administered the two measures and reported on their impulsiveness during their senior year of high school. Four years later, at the end of their mandatory military service, they were interviewed regarding their capacity for intimacy, and they filled out questionnaires. State of mind with regard to attachment and attachment styles uniquely predicted capacity for romantic intimacy and affective relationships with friends. Impulsiveness interacted with attachment security (benefiting dismissing and avoidant participants, and hampering secure ones) in predicting romantic intimacy. The discussion underscores the distinctiveness and importance of different facets of attachment representations to close relationships with peers.

A sample of 244 high school students was assigned to view clips depicting either one of three sexual stereotypes or neutral content. Participants then completed measures assessing their attitudes about sexual roles and relationships, their regular TV viewing habits, and their sexual experiences. Results indicated that more frequent viewing of talk shows and of "sexy" prime-time programs, and viewing TV more intently for companionship, were each associated with greater endorsement of sexual stereotypes. Additionally, more frequent viewing and stronger identification with popular TV characters were associated with greater levels of sexual experience. Laboratory exposure to specific stereotypical content lead to greater acceptance of gender and sexual stereotypes, as well. Implications for television's role as a sexual educator are discussed.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					2006	16	1					133	156		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2006.00125.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2006.00125.x													WOS:000234855200010
J	Youniss, J				Youniss, J			G. Stanley Hall: Neither psychology alone nor basic research is sufficient	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												In his monumental work, Adolescence, G. Stanley Hall showed the value of interdisciplinary scholarship and respect for research, which had a policy orientation. Over the course of the 20th century these two characteristics faded in adolescent studies as psychology took dominance and basic research was given priority over policy considerations. An argument is made that there is value in revisiting Hall's approach as studies of adolescence can be enriched through interdisciplinary efforts and research which brings policy to the forefront.																			1050-8392						2005	15	4					357	366		10.1111/j.1532-7795.2005.00101.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-7795.2005.00101.x													WOS:000233518500002
J	Larson, RW; Wilson, S; Mortimer, JT				Larson, RW; Wilson, S; Mortimer, JT			Conclusions: Adolescents' preparation for the future	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The future of societies depends on their success in providing pathways whereby young people develop and prepare themselves to be contributing adults to their communities. When these pathways are well marked, stable, supported by the community, and inviting to adolescents, a society can be confident that new generations will join the ranks of adulthood well prepared. When these paths are hazardous, unpredictable, uninviting, or ill fitted to the demands of adulthood in that society, the future is insecure, both for adolescents and for society. This volume and the additional two volumes of this study group (Brown, Larson, & Saraswathi, 2002; Mortimer & Brown, 2002) suggest the following observations about the experiences of youth and how well they are being prepared for adulthood in the 21st century.																			1050-8392						2002	12	1					159	166		10.1111/1532-7795.00029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1532-7795.00029													WOS:000174232000008

It was hypothesized that adolescent mothers' preexisting resources and emerging perceptions about parenting determine not only their children's but also their own later adaptation to critical life events. Maternal resources uniquely predicted later maternal cognitive functioning, personal adjustment, and child abuse potential, whereas maternal perceptions uniquely predicted maternal demographic status 3 years after childbirth. Moreover, maternal perceptions were found to mediate the influence of maternal resources on parent-child interactional styles. The unique roles that maternal resources and perceptions played in determining later maternal functioning are discussed.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					1997	7	4					457	478		10.1207/s15327795jra0704_6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0704_6								12293784					WOS:A1997YA02100006
J	Demo, DH; Acock, AC				Demo, DH; Acock, AC			Family structure, family process, and adolescent well-being	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This article examines the influence of family structure and family relationships on adolescent well-being. Using a subsample (N = 850) of data collected in the National Survey of Families and Households, we examine socioemotional adjustment, academic performance, and global well-being among adolescents (ages 12 to 18) living in the four most prevalent family structures in the United States: (a) intact first-married family units, (b) divorced, single-parent families, (c) stepfamilies, and (d) continuously single mothers and their children, one of the fastest growing types of households. These four family types vary dramatically on socioeconomic characteristics and measures of family relations. Compared to the other family types, families headed by continuously single mothers have the lowest income, whereas divorced families and stepfamilies report the highest levels of mother-adolescent disagreement and the lowest levels of parental supervision and mother-adolescent interaction. Unadjusted comparisons across family types reveal that adolescents in first-married families have slightly higher scores on all three measures of well-being, but few of the differences are statistically significant. Regression analyses indicate that the strongest and most consistent predictor of adolescent well-being is mother-adolescent disagreement. Other family process variables directly involving the mother-adolescent dyad (mother-adolescent interaction, aggression, and support) are consistently related to adolescent adjustment, academic performance, and well-being.																			1050-8392						1996	6	4					457	488																WOS:A1996VT15100006

The authors of the articles in this issue make strong cases for the importance of university-community collaborations and offer excellent examples of ongoing efforts and accomplishments thus far. They also recognize a convergent set of institutional barriers and challenges that individuals who undertake collaborative efforts might face. There are four issues about which I would like to comment: (a) defining ''the community,'' Cb) what universities can do for communities, (c) what communities can do for universities, and (d) how individuals can contribute to collaborative efforts. All of the articles in this issue represent a view from ''the university.'' In these comments, I try to include a view from the community, one informed by my own experience in conducting applied research and outreach and by comments made to me by community members.																			1050-8392						1996	6	1					71	79																WOS:A1996TU16100006
J	Rathunde, K				Rathunde, K			Family context and talented adolescents' optimal experience in school-related activities	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												A group of 165 talented high school students and their parents filled out family questionnaires, and quality of experience information was collected from students with the Experience Sampling Method (i.e., electronic pagers that randomly sampled experience in school activities) and with follow-up questionnaires. Students' perceptions of high support in their families were associated with parental reports of higher rewards nurturing their children; students' perceptions of high family challenge, on the other hand, were related to parental responses of greater happiness in their personal lives. Family support was also related to students' Experience Sampling Method reports of spontaneous interest (i.e., feeling open, excited, and involved) in school-related activities; and challenge in the family was related to directed interest (i.e., students' focus on important goals). Those who perceived their families as combining these 2 contextual dimensions reported more optimal experience in school tasks (i.e., more flow experience and undivided interest, or the combination of spontaneity and goal directedness). These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for adolescent development in the family.																			1050-8392	1532-7795					1996	6	4					605	628																WOS:A1996VT15100011

Questionnaires and responses to a simulation involving four videotaped episodes in which an adolescent was victimized were used to assess sympathy-related processes and reported prosocial response in 89 high-school pupils. In general, both dispositional and situational measures of cognitive understanding, perspective-taking, integrative goals, and sympathy were positively intercorrelated, and singly, they were positively associated with reported prosocial response. In the questionnaire data, a predominance of sympathy versus personal distress was associated with higher levels of reported prosocial response. Results were in the same direction for the simulation data, though not statistically significant. In both sets of data, a predominance of integrative goals versus self-enhancing goals was associated with higher levels of reported prosocial response. These findings suggest that, in adolescents, affective and motivational responses can be differentiated along a dimension of other- versus self-orientation and that these orientations may be associated with different responses to distress in peers.																			1050-8392						1995	5	2					173	200		10.1207/s15327795jra0502_2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0502_2													WOS:A1995QP78400002

The sample consisted of 142 inner-city ninth-grade students. With self-rated depression and anxiety as outcomes, interactions examined involved dependent and self-critical dysphoric tendencies, each with achievement-related issues (school grades) and interpersonal indices (teacher and peer ratings). Consistent with expectations and prior research, self-criticism interacted with both interpersonal and academic indices, whereas dependency was involved in interactions only with interpersonal indices. In terms of directionality, the pattern of results was consistent with prior findings, with a single exception. The trends found involving self-criticism and grades indicated that ramifications of academic achievement can vary across different sociodemographic groups.																			1050-8392						1995	5	4					431	449		10.1207/s15327795jra0504_3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327795jra0504_3													WOS:A1995RV13500003

A latent cross-lagged panel model on the triarchic model of grit and the 5Cs of positive youth development	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Grit, defined as passion and perseverance to achieve long-term goals, has been associated with adolescents' optimal academic and psychological functioning. However, the role of grit in adolescents' positive youth development (PYD)-characterized by the 5Cs known as competence, confidence, connection, character, and caring-remains unknown. Using latent cross-lagged panel modeling, this study examined the longitudinal relations between the triarchic model of grit (TMG) dimensions (i.e., perseverance of effort, consistency of interest, and adaptability to situations), and the 5Cs of PYD while controlling for specific socio-demographic covariates (gender, age, SES, and school type). Data were obtained from 1620 Filipino adolescents (M-age = 17.15; SDage = 1.00) in November 2021 and May 2022. Results show that grit dimensions predicted subsequent PYD dimensions, but not vice versa. Specifically, while perseverance and adaptability were linked to higher levels of competence, confidence, and character, consistency was associated with lower levels of competence and confidence six months later. Results highlight the importance of grit's dimensions in facilitating PYD characteristics among adolescents, especially efficacy-related Cs (competence and confidence). Theoretical and practical implications in promoting adolescent thriving and well-being are discussed.

How peer status and ability track shape behavioral disengagement over the transition from primary to secondary school	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												The transition from primary to secondary school is often associated with an increase in behavioral disengagement, which undermines students' academic development. Prior studies examined the average development of behavioral disengagement across school transitions. This study examined how students' peer status in primary school and ability track in secondary school relate to trajectories of behavioral disengagement. We followed n = 1564 students who transitioned to secondary school across three time points: February/March, and May/June in students' final year of primary school and January/February, roughly 6 months after students transited to secondary school. Latent Growth Curve Analyses showed that on average, behavioral disengagement increased, but this increase mostly occurred before transitioning to secondary school. Peer status and track related to students' initial levels of behavioral disengagement, but not to their development in behavioral disengagement over the transition. Specifically, students who were viewed as more popular by peers, and students who ended up in the lowest track showed more behavioral disengagement in primary school, whereas students who were more accepted by peers were less disengaged in primary school.

Integrating the family stress model within a longitudinal sibling-adoption study of adolescent externalizing behavior	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Using a sample of linked adopted children, adoptive and birth parents (N = 561), and biological siblings residing in the birth parent home (N = 191), we examined the role of genetics within family stress processes. We tested parental hostility (7 years) as a mediator of the associations between socioeconomic strain and rearing parent psychopathology (4 years) and adolescent externalizing behaviors (11 years) in adoptive and biological parent homes. Next, we examined parent social support (4 years) as a moderator of paths from socioeconomic strain and parent psychopathology to parental hostility. Parental hostility significantly mediated effects of socioeconomic strain and parent psychopathology on adolescent externalizing behaviors in biological and adoptive parent homes, respectively. Equivalence testing of the paths to adolescent externalizing behaviors across family types indicated a negligible role of passive gene-environment correlation. Parent social support significantly attenuated the effect of parent psychopathology on parental hostility in biological families. Birth parent externalizing behaviors were not significantly associated with adoptee externalizing behaviors nor adoptive parent hostility, suggesting negligible heritable risk or evocative gene-environment processes. Full- and half-sibling correlations indicated that children's unique rearing contexts contributed to the parenting they received and the externalizing behavior they exhibited. Implications for intervention are discussed.

Adolescents' perceptions of privacy violations by parents, siblings, and friends	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Adolescence is a life stage beset by a growing desire for privacy. This study evaluated adolescents' experiences across four types of potentially privacy-invasive behaviors (PPIVBs) and within four different types of relationships. 158 adolescents (Mage = 16.9 years, SD = 1.0; 53.5% female) reported on the frequency of the PPIVBs, perceived control over the behaviors, secret/private information threatened by the behaviors, and feelings of privacy invasion produced by the behaviors. Privacy experiences were more similar across relationships than across types of behavior. Stronger feelings of privacy invasion were reported for PPIVBs involving electronics and information, for behaviors by family members, when behaviors occurred infrequently, when adolescents perceived greater control over whether the behaviors occurred, and when behaviors threated secret/private information.

We lean on John Schulenberg's developmental framework to examine this question, focusing on the potential young adult milestones of high school and college graduation, employment, residential independence, romantic partnership, and parenthood. Data came from a prospective-longitudinal multi-method study with N = 1199 participants who were first assessed at age 5 years old and followed to age 31. An accumulation of positive transitions in young adulthood (age 25) was associated with lower likelihood of age 31 problematic cannabis use. The protective effect for problematic cannabis use remained even when adjusting for childhood adverse family environments and was primarily driven by successful college graduation and/or home ownership. The accumulation of positive transitions protected individuals at modest to somewhat elevated risk due to childhood adverse family environments from experiencing age 31 cannabis use problems. However, for other individuals with very high numbers of conduct problems, or with high levels of adolescent substance use, the protective effects of accumulated positive transitions to young adulthood were less strong or nonexistent. Moreover, individuals who completed college or obtained full-time employment by 25 were more likely to report problematic age 31 alcohol use. These findings highlight the central tenets of John Schulenberg's developmental framework, including the examination of ontogenetic continuity and discontinuity, the interplay of developmentally distal and proximal effects, and the identification of developmental protective factors that may sway people toward or away from substance use.

MBCSR was developed by an interdisciplinary team of educational psychologists, mindfulness researchers, computer scientists, and health experts. We integrated the strengths of contemplative approaches, collaborative small group discussions, learning technology, and multidimensional assessments of students' social-emotional outcomes. Using a quasi-experimental design, the study was implemented in four sixth-grade English language arts classrooms (2 experimental and 2 business-as-usual control; N = 74) in a public middle school in the Midwest of the United States. It was co-implemented by researchers and teachers, with sessions occurring for 45 minutes, once per week, for 8 weeks. The MBCSR group showed greater self-efficacy for using Upa-yoga and mindful breathing to regulate their emotions and behaviors (eta p2$$ {\eta}_p<^>2 $$ = .13), and lower externalizing (eta p2$$ {\eta}_p<^>2 $$ = .07) and bullying behaviors (eta p2$$ {\eta}_p<^>2 $$ = .09) at the posttest compared to the control group, after controlling for baseline differences. Students in the experimental group overall showed positive and relaxed emotional and physiological states during the sessions.

Contextualizing school discipline: Examining the role of general peer and teacher discrimination at the individual- and school-level on individual suspension	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Past research has linked peer and teacher discrimination to risk factors for school discipline, but few studies have examined whether peer and teacher discrimination have a direct impact on school discipline. This study examines the effects of general peer and teacher discrimination at the individual- and school-level on school suspension using nationally representative, secondary data on almost 12,000 youth across 131 schools. Hierarchical logistic regression models indicated that general teacher discrimination at the individual- and school-level-but not general peer discrimination-increased the odds of receiving school suspension. Findings suggest that general discrimination by direct learning instructors and teachers representing the broader school culture can shape student conduct. Reducing school discipline thus falls on teachers, staff, principals, and learners.																			1050-8392	1532-7795				SEP	2024	34	3					897	911		10.1111/jora.12968	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12968		MAY 2024						38716808					WOS:001217552900001

Study 1 had 777 adolescents (389 females; mean age = 12.79 years) complete a survey; Study 2 had 233 adolescents (111 females; mean age = 12.19 years) complete a survey twice spanning around 6 months. Study 1 showed adolescents' perceived maternal devaluing/invalidating and discounting/mitigating reactions as two distinct factors, with different patterns of associations with other supportive versus nonsupportive parenting practices.

This project aimed to explore the links between emotion regulation, negative parenting and student-teacher relationships using longitudinal and ecologically valid data. A sample of n = 209 young people enrolled in the 'Decades-to-Minutes' (D2M) study, based in Zurich, Switzerland, provided data from the ages of 7-20 via parent- and self-report questionnaires and ecological momentary assessment. Data were analyzed using Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling (DSEM). Worse student-teacher relationships predicted increased negative affectivity and emotional lability.

We found three distinct latent profiles with varying amounts of ECI: Profile 1: Moderate and decreasing ECI before the transition (57%); Profile 2: Low-decreasing ECI before the transition but increasing ECI after the transition (31%); and Profile 3: High and stable ECI during the transition (12%). Moreover, the ECI profiles related to school and life satisfaction as well as to school stress and dropout intentions in a meaningful way consistent with the stressor hypothesis. Chronically high and increasing ECI was related to negative outcomes.

Variability and change in adolescents' prosocial behavior across multiple time scales	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												We examined variability and change in adolescents' prosocial behaviors directed to peers and friends across four time scales: two-years, one-year, two-monthly, and daily. Data from three longitudinal datasets with a total of 569 adolescents (55.7% girl, M-age = 15.23, SD = 3.90) were included. The overall time-related stability of prosocial behavior across time scales was moderate to excellent. Variability did not differ between early (age 10-15) and late (age 16-21) adolescence, but late adolescence was associated with higher mean levels of prosociality. Finally, results indicated that prosocial behaviors measured over longer periods (i.e., two-years and one-year) were positively associated with cognitive processes (perspective taking), whereas prosocial behaviors measured over shorter periods (i.e., two-monthly) were positively associated with affective processes (empathy).					van de Groep, Suzanne/ABH-3488-2020	van de Groep, Suzanne/0000-0001-6135-0053													1050-8392	1532-7795				JUN	2023	33	2					575	590		10.1111/jora.12827	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jora.12827		JAN 2023						36639955					WOS:000922213200001

The present study investigated the mechanisms of the association between early adolescents' sleep and mind wandering with emotional symptoms and executive function as potential mediators. A total of 257 early adolescents (baseline aged 9-13 years old; 131 boys) completed the questionnaires consisting of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, mind wandering, depression and anxiety symptoms, and executive function. Cross-sectional and longitudinal data revealed a sequential mediation pathway of emotional symptoms and executive function in the association between sleep and mind wandering. The mediating effect of emotional symptoms in the link between sleep quality and mind wandering was significant among boys but not girls.

Longitudinal Change in Adolescent Depression and Anxiety Symptoms from before to during the COVID-19 Pandemic	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												This study aimed to examine changes in depression and anxiety symptoms from before to during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of 1,339 adolescents (9-18 years old, 59% female) from three countries. We also examined if age, race/ethnicity, disease burden, or strictness of government restrictions moderated change in symptoms. Data from 12 longitudinal studies (10 U.S., 1 Netherlands, 1 Peru) were combined. Linear mixed effect models showed that depression, but not anxiety, symptoms increased significantly (median increase = 28%). The most negative mental health impacts were reported by multiracial adolescents and those under 'lockdown' restrictions. Policy makers need to consider these impacts by investing in ways to support adolescents' mental health during the pandemic.

I-O children comprise 26% of young people in the U.S. and include those born outside the U.S. (first generation) and those with at least one parent born outside the U.S. (second generation). Using a qualitative approach, this study examined how I-O youth (N = 65, M = 16.22 years) experienced and engaged with the phenomena of the 2020 election season amidst recent economic, political, and social consequences from the pandemic and the current social movements against systemic racism. Findings expand our understanding of how I-O youth engage as political actors by examining the processes surrounding their sociopolitical development.

School Pushout: The Role of Supportive Strategies Versus Punitive Practices for LGBT Youth of Color	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Recently, schools have focused on supportive (e.g., behavioral supports) rather than punitive (e.g., suspension) strategies to reduce school pushout among marginalized youth. We examined the association between suspension and discipline practices for students with intersecting identities (e.g., LGBT youth of color). We used teacher and student data from 1,091 schools that participated in the California School Climate and California Healthy Kids Surveys. Relative to White LGBT youth, LGBT youth of color were at higher risk of being suspended, and youth were differentially affected by punitive policies depending on their race, sexual orientation, and/or gender identity. While supportive strategies were associated with lower risk of suspension, punitive practices were associated with higher risk of suspension, especially for LGBT youth of color.

The current study qualitatively analyzed adolescent narratives regarding their relationships with their parents. Seventy-two adolescents (68% female; M age = 16.56) provided three-minute speech samples that were examined using thematic analysis to understand key themes in adolescent-parent relationships from adolescents' perspectives. Overall, adolescents valued positive relationships with parents (involving emotional support and companionship), respected their authority, and looked to parents to role-model-valued traits. Mentions of negative interactions were mostly absent or justified as normal. Thus, normative adolescent-parent relationships are largely positive and valued by adolescents.

Differences in perceptions of parental trust, positivity, supervision, and discipline from ages 11-17 years were examined between sexual minority and heterosexual girls using data from the Pittsburgh Girls Study, a longitudinal, community-based study. Results indicated that sexual minority girls reported lower levels of parental trust and positivity compared to heterosexual girls beginning in mid-adolescence; differences in supervision were present at age 11 years and persisted over time.

Like me Back: Neural Correlates of Low Perceived Relational Value in Peer Victimized Youth	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Perceived relational value describes the extent to which individuals consider themselves to be liked and valued. Given the salience of peer opinions in adolescence, perceived relational value is an important part of adolescents' developing self-concept. Here, we examined the neural correlates of youth's perceptions of their relational value in two independent samples (N = 33, M-age = 13.71, SD = 2.71; N = 26, M-age = 15.43, SD = 0.33). In both studies, peer victimization was associated with lower perceived relational value behaviorally and with altered frontostriatal connectivity when perceiving low relational value during fMRI.

Adolescents completed an adaptation of the BART that manipulated social influence (cautious and risky) and risk information (i.e., informed, noninformed). Results showed that social influence impacts adolescents' decisions on the noninformed BART but not on the informed BART. In the noninformed BART, the peers' cautious choices strongly decreased risk-taking and led to greater performance. The peers' risky choices increase adolescents' risk-taking, but this effect is limited to situations involving minimal risk. Thus social experience may be a specific social context that represents a valuable source of information during adolescence, especially in situations with high uncertainty.

The Development of Impulsivity and Sensation Seeking: Associations with Substance Use among At-Risk Adolescents	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												We investigated if the dual systems model could explain the increased rates of substance use among at-risk youth. This study sampled 365 adolescents, 289 of which had a family history of substance use disorder, assessed biannually between the ages 13-16 years old. Growth curve analyses revealed that higher levels of impulsivity were related to higher levels of sensation seeking and a slower rate of decline in impulsivity was related to a faster rate of increase in sensation seeking. Only family history status and sensation seeking were directly associated with substance use (marijuana, alcohol) at age 16, though family history status was also indirectly related to substance use through higher levels of impulsivity to higher levels of sensation seeking.

One hundred Spanish international adoptees aged 12-18 took part in the study. Data were gathered with a structured interview, the Youth Self Report and the Adoption Communication Scale. A history of maltreatment prior to the adoption was associated with more closed communication between parents and children. Prenatal drug exposure shows a relationship with the presence of externalizing behaviors and attention problems in adolescents. Finally, a lower degree of communicative openness regarding the child's origins was significantly associated with the presence of all the adolescent behavioral problems studied.

We investigated informant discrepancy in psychosexual functioning, using the self-report and parent report versions of the Teen Transition Inventory (TTI), of adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; 136 parent-child dyads) compared to adolescents from the general population (GP; 70 parent-child dyads). Significantly larger informant discrepancies exist in ASD dyads than GP dyads in most domains of psychosexual functioning, except for Body image, Sexual behavior, and Confidence in the future. It is important to use and pay attention to both informants, as discrepancies are relevant for both research and clinical practice regarding psychosexual functioning.

A Person-Centered Approach to the Study of Black Adolescent Religiosity, Racial Identity, and Sexual Initiation	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Decreasing the number of adolescents who have never had sexual intercourse is one way to address sexual health disparities. We used intersectionality to explore the joint effects of religiosity and racial identity on Black adolescent sexual initiation. Data originated from the National Survey of American Life-Adolescent (n = 1,170), a nationally representative study of Black adolescents. Latent profile analysis and survival analysis were used to evaluate study hypotheses. Results showed four distinct profiles of religiosity and racial identity. These profiles explained 19% of the variability in sexual initiation. Additional analyses revealed sociodemographic differences in profile membership. Findings contribute to understanding ethnic heterogeneity among Black adolescents and racial identity and religiosity as sociocultural factors that influence sexual initiation; and support reconceptualizing Black adolescent religiosity.

We present five different facets regarding interdisciplinary research that are important to puberty. A short history of philosophical issues instrumental in promoting early interdisciplinary research is first presented. We discuss then what is hard and what is easy about interdisciplinary research, the purpose of which is to alert scientists to challenges and opportunities for interdisciplinary research on puberty. Readers then are introduced to advances and obstacles in interdisciplinary research on development. Recommendations for tailoring graduate education toward interdisciplinarity are introduced. Finally, issues related to publication, education of scientists, and policy makers are described. The report concludes with a discussion of funding and policy issues.

Patterns of Sensitivity to Parenting and Peer Environments: Early Temperament and Adolescent Externalizing Behavior	JOURNAL OF RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENCE												Although parenting behavior and friendship quality predict adolescent externalizing behaviors (EBs), individual differences in temperament may differentially affect susceptibility to these factors over time. In a multi-method and multi-informant study of 141 children followed prospectively from toddlerhood to adolescence, we tested the independent and interactive associations of age 3 reactive temperament (e.g., negative emotionality) and age 13 observed parenting (i.e., positive and negative behavior) and friendship (i.e., conflict and warmth), with multi-informant ratings of age 15 aggression and rule-breaking behavior. Negative parenting predicted growth in parent-rated EB, but only for adolescents with early reactive temperament. Temperament did not affect sensitivity to positive parenting or friendship. Results are discussed in the context of differential susceptibility theory and intervention implications for adolescents.
